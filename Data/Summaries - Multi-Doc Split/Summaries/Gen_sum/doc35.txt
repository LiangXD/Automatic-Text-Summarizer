An experimental cancer drug that works after a single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study. Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia. The Scripps doctors concluded that the medicine, called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA, may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia. Since then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from hairy-cell leukemia. It's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments.
