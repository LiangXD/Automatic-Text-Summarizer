DeFronzo, who in 1988 was chosen the top diabetes investigator by Canadian and Japanese diabetes associations, says his unit at the Health Science Center will try to use many of Stern's patients for research. The problem with Type II diabetics is not that they don't make enough insulin they don't respond to the insulin, DeFronzo said. That is why the American Diabetes Assn. and other health education groups in the Los Angeles area and California have begun a major push to educate Latinos about diabetes. The effort is being aided by interested physicians and by drug companies, which make insulin and other drugs used for diabetes that can't be controlled by changes in eating habits. Beginning this summer, Torres and other health professionals will be offering nutrition and exercise classes geared toward Hispanics in an effort to educate them on the dangers of diabetes.
