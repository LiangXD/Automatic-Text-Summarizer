Sunday) and was centered in the Hidaka mountain range, 45 miles away from Saturday's earthquake, which measured a preliminary 6.4 on the scale. Both earthquakes also occurred in quake-prone areas where edges of the earth's crustal plates are thought to rub together, a Central Meteorological Agency official said. A 7 reading is a major earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake, capable of tremendous damage. A major earthquake rumbled through the jungles of southern Sudan on Sunday near the war-torn region's largest city, but officials said there appeared to be no casualties and little damage. Egypt's two principal earthquake monitoring stations, including one at the Aswan High Dam, 600 miles south of Cairo and just north of the Sudan border, recorded the quake at 7.5 on the Richter scale. The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988. The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7 according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Two of the plates sink beneath the islands of Japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the Earth directly below Tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. Painfully aware of its problems, Japan is moving full speed ahead in earthquake engineering research, and the country is trying to develop the world's best earthquake warning system before the next great quake hits. He has concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. That dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, as well as about 1,000 smaller quakes every month.
