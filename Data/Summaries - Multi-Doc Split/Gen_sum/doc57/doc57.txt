Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale. The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area Oct. Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.6m) a year monitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research. Despite the protests, however, Japan's earthquake prediction programme rolls along on inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations. Japan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists throughout the world were optimistic about prediction. Japan has had numerous killer quakes outside the Tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off the coast of Hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives. On May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles long in southern Chile, releasing energy nearly 1,000 times that of this year's San Francisco quake. The New Madrid (pronounced MAD-rid) fault still has 150 small, mostly unfelt, earthquakes a year. No responsible scientist can predict an exact day for an earthquake, says Brian Mitchell, a quake expert at St. Louis University, echoing the majority opinion. Trying to calm the fear, the National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, a panel of academic and government seismic experts, will review the Browning claim at a meeting in a few weeks.
