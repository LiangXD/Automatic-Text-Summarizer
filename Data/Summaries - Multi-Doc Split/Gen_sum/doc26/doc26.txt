Although landlocked, Malawi proved in the 1991/92 drought it was adequately equipped to handle the transportation, storage and internal distribution of large volumes of food imported through South Africa, Mozambican or, possibly, Tanzanian ports [words indistinct]. But in the meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow. THE effects of widespread drought on grain production in South Africa could negate the expected recovery in economic growth in the second half of the year, Mr Kraai van Niekerk, the country's agriculture minister, said yesterday. None the less, Pretoria is understood to be contemplating substantial drought aid for farmers: several hundred million rands, or perhaps as much as R1bn (Pounds 200m) over two to three years. Without such aid, the Maize Board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de grace. The dairy sector, like maize, was in crisis before the drought, because of the government's producer price policy, which has pushed farmers into export crops (such as tobacco), horticulture and even game farming.
