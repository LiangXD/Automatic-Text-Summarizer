Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the department's chief economist, said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of food this year, 2 percent next year. Today's reports confirm that the drought has had a major impact on this year's crops, Wilson told reporters. Wilson said USDA experts continue to believe that the drought will add only one percentage point to consumer food prices this year. Wilson said the drought could add 2 percent to the consumer price index for food next year. President Reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program. Before the drought began damaging crops this month, the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers. Paul Prentice of Farm Sector Economics Associates, a forecasting concern, thinks the drought could so deplete U.S. stockpiles that the Agriculture Department would drop much of its farm crisis-era planting restrictions.
