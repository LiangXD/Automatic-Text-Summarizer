An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise ship off the Mexican coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze and the ship with 715 people aboard was towed to port. The March 15 engine-room fire aboard the Star, carrying 439 mostly American passengers, was discovered by a crew member as the ship returned from Cozumel, Mexico to its Tampa home port. Rich Steck, a spokesman for Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, which owns the ship, said it would return to Miami on Wednesday night after a Coast Guard safety inspection rather than continue the cruise. Diana Orban, a spokeswoman for Cruise Lines International Association, a New York-based group that has 35 members, notes that only two people have been killed on cruise ships serving U.S. ports since 1970. Ships operating from U.S. ports carried about five million passengers last year, and in anticipation of continued growth, 20 cruise ships are under construction around the world. But the overriding concern, the board said, is that foreign cruise ships are subject to rules that are less stringent and vigorously enforced than those imposed on U.S. flag vessels. But almost all cruise ships operating out of the continental U.S. sail under foreign flags, and the U.S. Coast Guard conducts only cursory inspections of foreign vessels.
