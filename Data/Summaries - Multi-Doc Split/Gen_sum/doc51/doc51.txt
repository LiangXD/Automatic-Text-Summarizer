Hundreds of thousands of Hindu pilgrims plunged into sacred rivers and pools during a solar eclipse Sunday, believing they would be freed of sin and attain salvation. As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial eclipse, it was possible to see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun. In Los Angeles, for instance, the eclipse will have started before the sun has set or the moon has risen. By the time the sky has darkened completely in California, the moon will already be in the deepest part of its eclipse. Total eclipse, when all of the moon is covered by the umbra, will begin at about 10:20 p.m. Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun. During the past week, newspapers, television and radio have been full of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice for spectators not to stare directly into the sun.

In Hawaii, the volcano Mauna Loa stunned visiting astronomers by producing a dazzling show of steam and glowing lava at the height of the eclipse.
