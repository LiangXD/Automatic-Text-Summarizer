It isn't a term a grandiloquent national security adviser like Henry Kissinger would have used, but it's an indicator of the kind of efficient and noncontroversial NSC operation Gen. Powell can be expected to run. President Reagan will nominate national security adviser Colin Powell for promotion to four-star rank and the post of commander-in-chief of the Army's Forces Command, the White House and Pentagon announced today. The promotion would make the 51-year-old Powell, now a lieutenant general with three stars, the fourth black officer to attain four-star rank in the U.S. armed forces. President Reagan has the highest respect and affection for General Powell and wishes him all success in his Army career, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in announcing the nomination. Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have outweighed his military experience. He's had experiences few can match, said Robert Sims, a former Pentagon spokesman who knew Powell when he served as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's military aide. Powell said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan released earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five years shows we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal. Expects 'Backward Steps' Reflecting the rising skepticism, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) told Powell: We certainly, I think, have to be prepared for backward steps to occur in the Soviet Union. But the silky steeliness displayed during the crisis by Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has revived discussion of moving Vice President Dan Quayle out to make room for the general on the 1992 Republican ticket.
