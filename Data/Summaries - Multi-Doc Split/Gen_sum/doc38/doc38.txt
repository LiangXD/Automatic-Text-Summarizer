Even the scientists came to cross-purposes in designing this little world. Ms. Leigh has been living inside a test module for Biosphere II, a $30 million project under construction. Walford and Biosphere spokeswoman Kathleen Dyhr, also hoping to make the crew, said each candidate has worked on the project for at least three years. He and Connors also said most studies of crews, including mixed-sex groups in environments far harsher and smaller than the biospherians are likely to encounter, have shown them to be highly motivated, energetic and willing to put up with almost anything for the sake of the project and the team's success. It will be a laboratory for solving environmental problems on Biosphere I _ the Earth _ as well as a prototype for sustaining life outside this world. For two years, the crew's world inside the geodesic frame of glass and steel will consist of seven ecological regions: rain forest, savannah, ocean, fresh and saltwater marshes, desert, agriculture and human habitat. The creation of billionaire oil mogul Edward Bass, Biosphere 2 aims to study how people can live in an airtight world. The mood inside Biosphere 2 was upbeat last week as participants counted down the days until Thursday's closure, when air locks will be shut and the crew sealed inside. News reports since 1985 have linked the project's leaders to a 1970s commune where, some ex-commune members say, Biosphere 2 executive John Allen led a cult devoted to creating a new civilization.
