   The jumbo jet that crashed had at least 24 mechanical problems
during the past eight years, including cracks, severe corrosion and
an on-board fire, according to FAA service records.
   FAA spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane said there have been problems with
minor cracks in 747s over the past few years, but inspections did
not find much cracking.
   ``Those are certainly very reliable airplanes,'' she said, adding
that the problems reported did not appear unusual given the length
of time the plane had been in service.
   Officials at Pratt &amp; Whitney in said they doubted their engines,
which powered the aircraft, caused the crash, and that the plane
could have continued to fly even if three of the four engines failed
at once.
