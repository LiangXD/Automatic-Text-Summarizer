   The south entrance of Yellowstone National Park may reopen today
as winds are forecast to calm.
   Firefighters wet down buildings at the Canyon cabin and hotel
complex and moved brush and dead trees out of the path of the
109,000-acre North Fork fire.
   Eight fires are burning more than one-fifth of the park's 2.2
million acres. The largest blaze, the Clover-Mist, grew by nearly
40,000 acres to 231,000 acres.
   To the south in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, strong winds
pushed the 42,000-acre Huck fire 7,000 acres to the east Tuesday.
Both the Huck fire and the 112,500 Mink Creek fire also are growing
north toward Yellowstone.
