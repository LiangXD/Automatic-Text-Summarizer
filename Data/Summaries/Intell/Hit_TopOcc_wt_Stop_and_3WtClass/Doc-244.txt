earnings for gm common stock, reflecting the performance of gm's core automotive operations, will be disclosed this morning. the earnings drop at gm hughes electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of hughes aircraft co. and gm's north american automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the delco electronics corp. side of the gm hughes unit. profit at the unit fell to $110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $24 million one-time charge associated with hughes's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end. that decline was reflected in revenue for the gm hughes unit, which edged down to $2.58 billion from $2.63 billion. in the nine months, gm hughes net fell 6.6% to $486.6 million, or $1.48 a share, from $521 million, or $1.58 a share. gmac profits are combined with earnings from the rest of gm's operations and attributed to the company's traditional common stock. revenue from non-gm accounts was 45% of eds's total business in the latest nine months, compared with 40% a year earlier.
