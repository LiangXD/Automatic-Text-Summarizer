geneva, jan 18 (afp) -- a report by delegates from the international committee of the red cross (icrc), currently visiting prisoners from afghanistan held at a us base in cuba, will remain confidential, an icrc spokesman said on friday [18 january]. icrc envoys are discussing with us officials whether to release the number of detainees and their nationalities, said christen. the findings from the visit, which got under way on friday and is expected to last at least one week, will be presented directly to us authorities, christen told reporters. the four-member team, which includes a doctor, will inspect conditions and treatment of the increasing number of taliban and al-qa'ida prisoners arriving at the base from afghanistan. the number of detainees being held at the isolated us military outpost on cuba's southwestern coast rose on thursday to 110 after the arrival of another 30 prisoners from afghanistan. if a doubt exists as to the status of a person, this doubt must be decided by a tribunal acting on the basis of judicial guarantees, he added. asked about special courts to be set up by the bush administration to try the al-qaeda detainees, christen pointed out the courts were not yet operating and their procedures were still unknown.
