'axis of evil' charge raises questions washington -- president bush's declaration that countries such as iran, iraq and north korea represent an "axis of evil" that must be prevented from acquiring weapons of mass destruction touched off questions around the globe wednesday. but the president's remarks clearly expanded the scope of his anti-terrorism campaign while elevating the fight against the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons to a major foreign-policy priority, u.s. officials said. the president told congress that iran, iraq and north korea pose "a grave and growing danger" because they seek weapons of mass destruction and have links with terrorist groups. and north korea's official korean central news agency (kcna) monitored in seoul had this to say: "the remarks were merely a shenanigan aimed at continuing with its policy of agression against us." the rhetoric also caused shudders in u.s. allies south korea, where president kim dae-jung has rested his reputation on easing a half-century of confrontation with the heavily armed communist north, and japan, which is also within missile range of north korea. but u.s. officials have watched with chagrin in recent weeks as iran has funneled weapons to its proxies in western afghanistan and attempted to ship sophisticated arms to yasser arafat's palestinian authority. after assuming office, bush initially declined to continue the clinton administration's talks with pyongyang on halting its development and export of ballistic missiles but eventually offered talks.
