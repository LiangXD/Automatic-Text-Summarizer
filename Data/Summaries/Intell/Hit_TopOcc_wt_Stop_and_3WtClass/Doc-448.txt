november 27, 1995 dear friend: what kind of people benefit by your contribution to pleasant run children's homes? little ones, like baby jessica, caught in the struggle between adoptive and birth parents. families are being torn apart, and too often, children are the victims. kids like tommie j., made a ward of the court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father alice, sent to a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders and john h., a recovering alcoholic, rebuilding a relationships with his family so they can live together again. the children and families who come to pleasant run are given the opportunity to become happy, loving, and productive members of our society. they welcome the chance to belong, to become self- sufficient, to regain their self-esteem and confidence. for pleasant run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families, we need your support.
