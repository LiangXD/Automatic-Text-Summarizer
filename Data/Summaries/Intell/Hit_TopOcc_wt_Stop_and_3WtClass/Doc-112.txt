china's minister in charge of taiwan affairs says beijing will not resort to force to defend taiwan despite the changing situation on the island, which he described as our renegade province. wang's visit, which will also take in malaysia, singapore and indonesia, comes as pressure mounts on both sides to resume dialogue as beijing is poised to become a member of the world trade organisation next year. he said beijing will maintain its pursuit of peaceful unification with taiwan and welcomed the resumption of dialogue, bogged down since 1999. nevertheless, taiwan heightened its diplomatic campaign through what wang said was parliamentarian or private diplomacy to win recognition from beijing's allies. beijing was so worried about the tactic that chinese premier zhu rongji raised the matter in may with thai leaders during his official visit to thailand. wang said beijing raised no objections to the so-called stop-over tactic used by taiwanese leaders as long as the visits do not generate political activities in the host country. last year there were 2.85 million taiwanese visitors in china, he said.
