the swedish and us authorities are looking for people who might have been exposed to dangerous radiation, but there is no indication that the container started to leak in sweden. according to all indications, the radioactive container sent from the nuclear technology firm studsvik to the us did not leak during transport within sweden. when the container was transshipped in paris, measurements showed no abnormal levels, according to the us transport department. the us transport department has now informed studsvik that the measurements done by federal express in paris showed no abnormality. it this information is correct, it means that fewer people will have been exposed to radiation, said hans-bertil hakansson, studsvik managing director and concern chief, to dn [dagens nyheter]. however, it is extremely unlikely that the leak occurred during the flight from paris to memphis, hakansson said. yesterday [07 january], the national institute of radiation protection (ssi) announced that it could not exclude the possibility of people who had come into contact with the container suffering acute health effects from radiation.
