yet, some americans and brits have been hollering about the u.s. treatment of these tough guys. amnesty international issued a press release accusing the united states of keeping prisoners incommunicado, (using) sensory deprivation, the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them in an effort to 'break' the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation. it should be noted that much of the uproar is over photographs of the detainees taken as they were being transported from airplanes to their cells. as the washington post reported, foreign office parliamentary secretary ben bradshaw also explained that there were no gags, no goggles, no earmuffs and no shackles while (the prisoners) are in their cells. as for the unnecessary restraint, one detainee has announced that he wants to kill an american before he leaves cuba, and another detainee bit a guard, according to pentagon spokesman capt. some brits and amnesty international want them to be officially classified as pows. white house spokesman ken lisaius rightly noted of the club gitmo guests that, for the most part, they're members of al qaeda and if they were free, they'd engage in murder once again.
