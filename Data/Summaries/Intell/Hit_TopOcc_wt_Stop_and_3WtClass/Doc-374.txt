i am telling you what i believe in every inch of my body to be the truth, and i have spent a lot of time on secure video with the people down there, he told reporters, referring to the united states naval base at guantanamo bay, cuba, where 158 prisoners from the war in afghanistan are being jailed. it was prompted by a rising tide of international criticism after the defense department released photographs over the weekend that showed some of the prisoners kneeling before their captors, their legs in shackles, their hands bound in manacles, their mouths covered by surgical masks and their eyes blinded by large goggles with black tape. critics said the united states was using sensory deprivation and other psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners so that interrogations would be more fruitful. keeping prisoners incommunicado, sensory deprivation, the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them are all classic techniques employed to break the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation, the organization said. asked what benefit the united states gets by not classifying the captives as prisoners of war, mr. rumsfeld said, i don't know enough of the legal technicalities to answer your question. mr. rumsfeld said one of the complicating factors was that the geneva conventions give protection to prisoners from countries but not from terrorist organizations, like al qaeda, to which some of the prisoners apparently belong. officials have said the prisoners come from a range of countries, - britain, yemen, china, saudi arabia and australia among them - and that has also complicated the legal picture.
