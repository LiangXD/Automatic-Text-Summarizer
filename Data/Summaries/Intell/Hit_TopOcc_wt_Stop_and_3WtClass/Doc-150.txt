president hugo chavez has warned that certain sectors have once again taken up the idea of looking forceful way out in venezuela, either through a coup or an attack that would end his life. since they have realized that this train is not stopping and that they are not going to stop it or run it off the track, ideas about destabilization have once again surfaced. chavez added that they are going around looking for a pinochet, analyzing man by man to see who could be the pinochet that they could pit against chavez, and i am sure that there is no pinochet in the fan. the president charged that attacks targeting his person have gone on for over 10 years, and that he has been accused, among other things, of ties with the guerrillas, of buying arms and trying to set up a communist regime in venezuela. chavez said that more efforts would be made in 2002 to get the country moving ahead since he believes that it will be quite difficult politically, economically and socially. he noted that as the year draws to a close, the indicators are positive for venezuela, then emphasized that the country has regained such internationally recognized posts as the presidency of the group of the 15 and the group of the 77. as for argentina's decision not to pay its debt, the president said the measure would give the economy and people some breathing room.
