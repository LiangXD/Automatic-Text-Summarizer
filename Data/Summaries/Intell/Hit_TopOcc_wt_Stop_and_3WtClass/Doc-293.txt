violent protests in argentina president duhalde calls for calm buenos aires - president eduardo duhalde yesterday pleaded for patience as he works on the country's economic crisis. we can't solve all of the country's problems in three weeks, he told local radio, hours after tens of thousands of argentines took to the streets around the country in a pot-banging demonstration. duhalde, who took office on january 2 as argentina's fifth president in a month, vowed his government would unveil a new economic program to rescue the country from four years of recession. daily protests have engulfed argentina: popular rage has boiled over against duhalde's decision to devalue the peso by more than 30 percent and further tighten a banking freeze that has locked most argentines' savings into bank accounts. the beleaguered president made no mention of the widely despised banking freeze that has presented a nettlesome challenge to his three-week-old administration: how to give argentines their savings back without prompting an all-out collapse of the financial system. late friday night, argentines' impatience peaked, and duhalde faced the second and most widespread protest since he assumed the presidency after similar protests forced his predecessors from office. under a driving rain, more than 10,000 argentines banged pots and pans in the plaza de mayo to protest the banking freeze, shouting insults at the country's political leaders, the supreme court, and banks - all of whom the argentines blame for plunging the country into its worst economic crisis in decades.
