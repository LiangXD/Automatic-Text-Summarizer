mugabe predicts victory in zimbabwe's election zimbabwe's incumbent president robert mugabe saturday predicted victory in the country's two- horse presidential race, saying that he will accept the outcome of the election because he will have defeated morgan tsvangirai of the opposition movement for democratic change (mdc). looking tired but blithesome after more than a month of daily election campaigns throughout the southern african country, mugabe cast his vote in a weekend presidential poll, in which he is facing a serious challenge from his main rival tsvangirai. he told journalists after casting his ballot that he was more than confident of winning the election. while defying international pressure to back down from his controversial land reforms, mugabe has said he needs a new six- year mandate to complete the reforms. the european union imposed sanctions on mugabe and 19 of his close associates last month, while the united states took the same move, accusing mugabe of violating human rights and cracking down on the opposition, the media and judiciary. in mugabe's view, the march election is a new chapter in his long struggle against colonial rule, which he led from the early 1960s until the country's independence. mugabe even talked about his desire to keep safeguarding zimbabwe's sovereignty and land in spirit when he dies, a dream which the veteran leader said forced him to sacrifice a bright teaching career in the 1950s to lead his compatriots out of colonial rule.
