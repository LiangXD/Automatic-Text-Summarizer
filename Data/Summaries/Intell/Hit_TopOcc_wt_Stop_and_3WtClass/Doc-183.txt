one of the main us diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the nmd and russia to agree to revise the anti-ballistic missile treaty [amd] by flashing a carrot on a stick. at one time, he said the new us missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race on another occasion, he stated the anti-ballistic missile treaty signed by the soviet union and the united states in 1972 was a product of the cold war era, and thus has lost its binding force. this march, catering to the interests of the us oil and coal barons who have made large political donations to the republican party, bush announced, without prior consultations with its allies, that the united states would not enforce the kyoto protocol which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world. hard on the heels of that decision, the us negotiation representative marie chevrier announced in geneva that the bush administration would not support the implementation of the biological weapons convention and that the united states strongly objected to the concrete enforcement plan of this convention. the united states views itself as a major force of anti-terrorism, for in the world only the united states has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism. bush said, either you are with us or you are with the terrorists and any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the united states as a hostile regime. the united states wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country's attitude toward it.
