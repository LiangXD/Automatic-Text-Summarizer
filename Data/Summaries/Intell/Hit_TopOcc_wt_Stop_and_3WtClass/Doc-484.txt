it is learned that the manned spaceship will have a liftoff weight of about eight tonnes, and is less than 10 meters long and 3.5 meters in diameter. the return capsule, connected to the orbiter capsule, is the cockpit of the astronauts and the only capsule that will reenter the atmosphere for landing. at the rear of the spaceship is the propulsion capsule to provide thrust to the spaceship in orbital control and return to earth. in accordance with the plan, china's manned spaceship will conduct a series of scientific tests and earth observation after it is launched into space. it is speculated that the spaceship will almost certainly be equipped with facilities relating to military observation and attack on enemy satellites. according to the experience of the united states and russia, one of the greatest problems of manned spaceship is inadequate power supply. by referring to the designs of the russia spaceship soyuz, it is very possible that china will apply the lift control technology in its manned spaceship.
