shuttle atlantis thunders toward space station cape canaveral - seven astronauts and a truckload of hardware are racing toward the international space station following the successful blastoff monday of the space shuttle atlantis. the launch was the first of six scheduled for the next seven months in a flurry of activity designed to get the space station closer to completion. riding three new main engines that belched an orange pillar of fire, atlantis thundered off the seaside launch pad at 4:44 p.m. a computer glitch marred the countdown as engineers frantically reloaded software, finishing the job with just 11 seconds to spare. "you spent a few extra days in florida," nasa launch director mike leinbach told atlantis commander mike bloomfield moments before liftoff. in four space walks during the 11-day mission, astronauts will install the "keystone" center support unit for the international space station. the 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound "s-zero" structure's first job will be to support a new solar energy array nearly an acre in size, stretching more than a football field in length.
