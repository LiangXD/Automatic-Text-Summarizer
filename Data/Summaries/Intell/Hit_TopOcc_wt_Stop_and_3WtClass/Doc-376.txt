these criticisms, even if contradictory, increase pressure on the i.m.f. and the bush administration to articulate a clear policy toward financial rescue efforts, which often come under fire even when they are judged successful. treasury secretary paul h. o'neill came into office publicly denouncing multibillion dollar bailouts, saying that either they fail outright or they allow foreign governments to get away with bad policymaking and investors to get away with bad bets. peru's finance minister, pedro pablo kuczynski, complained today that the fund bungled its dealings with argentina by adopting inconsistent policies that were at turns passive and inflexible. when argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, bush administration officials did not take a firm position, allowing the i.m.f. to make the call on withholding additional loans, people involved in the fund's deliberations said. but he said that he disagreed with the decision by the fund and the bush administration to continue the aid program in august, when he said the situation in argentina had likely deteriorated beyond repair. mr. mussa acknowledged that even when the political and economic situation in argentina was more stable, a move to delay debt payments or devalue the currency ran the risk of rattling financial markets and even causing a financial implosion in the region. moreover, it is difficult to place blame for argentina's economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy was designed by argentina itself, sometimes over the objections of the fund's economists.
