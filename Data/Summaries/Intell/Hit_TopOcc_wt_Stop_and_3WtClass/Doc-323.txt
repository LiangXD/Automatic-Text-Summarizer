president unleashes army, rocket launchers, mig-21s subhead: rumblings of rebellion: opposition aghast at 'state terrorism' author: jan cienski harare, zimbabwe - elements of zimbabwe's army began leaving their barracks yesterday in an ominous sign that robert mugabe intends to rig this weekend's presidential election and is preparing for a fight if the opposition challenges him. observers and the opposition worry mr. mugabe, the country's only president in 22 years of independence, is becoming increasingly reckless in his attempt to hold on to power. already, his ruling zimbabwean african national unity-patriotic front party has moved to disenfranchise thousands of supporters of the opposition movement for democratic change. much of the country's tiny white minority has been disenfranchised and mr. mugabe issued a decree, earlier ruled illegal by the supreme court, which forces people to vote in their home districts. if i stay in harare, i will not be able to vote, said desire chikondi, an mdc party worker whose house was burned down this week by zanu-pf youth militia members and who is now hiding out in the mdc's harare headquarters. if mr. mugabe wins, we are going to fight, my friend, said an mdc supporter and trader in harare's main market, while senior government officials have indicated they will not respect an mdc victory. we are willing to defend the interests of the people of zimbabwe at all costs and will not stand idly by if the election is clearly not free and fair, he said.
