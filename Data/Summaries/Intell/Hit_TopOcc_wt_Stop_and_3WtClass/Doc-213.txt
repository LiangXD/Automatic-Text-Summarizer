govt dismisses us rights report government yesterday trashed a us human rights report which lists a number of human rights violations in namibia at the hands of security forces and government. the us government report on namibia's human rights practices for 2001, released this week, says members of the security forces committed several extra-judicial killings during security operations in the kavango and caprivi regions during 2001. during arrests and detentions, security force members reportedly tortured and beat citizens who were suspected of complicity with unita, the report says. according to the rights report, most of the abuses were perpetrated by special field force (sff) members. the report says even though the namibian constitution provided that people arrested must be informed of the reason for their arrest and be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours of their detention, this has not been the case. the report charged that many people were arrested on the basis of suspicious links with angolan rebel movement, unita, and the caprivi liberation army (cla). shivute said namibia attached little value to the latest us rights report as it carried a lot of factual inaccuracies and was a mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports.
