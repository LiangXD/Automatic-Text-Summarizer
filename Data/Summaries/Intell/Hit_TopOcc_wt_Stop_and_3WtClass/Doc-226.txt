the annual report published by the national bureau for defending land and resisting colonization in cooperation with the international solidarity establishment for human rights said that the nuclei of 36 new settlements were established from march 2001 to the end of november 2001 in various parts of the west bank. taysir khalid explained that the palestinian intifadah has raised the settlement issue anew--one of the causes of the intifadah--in unprecedented force as a basic element and condition for reaching any solution. he said: at a time when israel's economic growth rate declined to 1.5 percent and the budgets of the ministry of labor and welfare and other ministries were cut, sharon's government maintained its support for settlements and increased it to compensate for the growing exodus from settlements. he noted that the year since sharon became israel prime minister and his pursuit of a destructive, aggressive policy against the palestinian people has proved that the conflict with the palestinian people who cling to their national rights cannot be settled by force. he explained that palestinian population centers were used as human shields for the protection of settlements, and that about 90 percent of the bombardments to which palestinian population centers were subjected originated in settlements. he confirmed that 30 palestinians were martyred at the hands of settlers, 60 persons were hit by settlers' bullets, while more than 77 others were injured in various assaults by settlers. he noted that during the current intifadah settlers uprooted more than 6,580 fruit trees, destroyed more than 4,099 cultivated donums, while 85 houses, 90 commercial premises, more than 100 cars, and 17 ambulances were damaged as a result of attacks carried out by settlers.
