we planted trees mainly in the major five areas that are severely endangered by sandy wind, said cai baojun, an official with the bureau in charge of forest planting. the shifting dunes in beijing's suburbs and rural areas have been successfully controlled by green barriers of trees and grass, which have also helped upgrade the city's forest proportion to 43 per cent, 23 percentage points higher than the nation's metropolitan average. forestry experts said dry weather and temperature fluctuations were the main cause of sandstorms. the repeated breaching of the embankments of the yongding and chaobai rivers also resulted in the desertification of the land with heavy sand being deposited by floods. by 2005, 50 per cent of beijing's land, including both urban and rural areas, will have been covered with trees. over the next 10 years, china will invest 6 billion yuan (us$720 million) to prevent sandstorms hitting beijing, according to sources from the state forestry administration. it is believed that sand from northern areas, especially the inner mongolia autonomous region, and floating dust from the city's uncovered construction sites are the main causes.
