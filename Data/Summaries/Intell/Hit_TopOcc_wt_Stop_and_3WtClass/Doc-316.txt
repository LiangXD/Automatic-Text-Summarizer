venezuelan military forces president hugo chavez to resign after a day of bloodshed author: jorge rueda caracas, venezuela (ap) - president hugo chavez, whose social and economic policies polarized venezuela and whose friendship with cuba irritated the united states, resigned under military pressure friday after a massive opposition demonstration ended in a bloodbath. the gigantic demonstration in caracas late thursday was the culmination of a strike called by the one-million-member venezuelan workers confederation and the business association fedecamaras. the armed forces - which have traditionally strong ties to the u.s. military - resented chavez's distancing of venezuela from washington, including a decision to suspend venezuela's participation in regional military exercises. i urge venezuelans to maintain calm, to keep faith, to continue working on the road toward democracy, freedom and peace, said retired gen. guaicaipuro lameda, who until february headed the oil company and was a leader of the movement to oust chavez. and he had alienated many sectors of venezuelan society, with his attacks on the news media and roman catholic church leaders, his refusal to consult with business leaders, and his failed attempt to assert government control over labour groups. chavez also exasperated venezuelans with his frequent use of cadenas - hours-long presidential speeches that by law had to be broadcast by all venezuelan tv and radio stations. after thursday's violence, the high command decided chavez had to go, and they confronted him en masse in his offices, anselmi said.
