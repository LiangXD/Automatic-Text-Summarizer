new york 1997-03-31 u.s. crude oil prices are likely to remain entrenched in a weak range this week amid ample physical supplies , but analysts say the upcoming _ driving season _ could begin to mop up some of the excess. analysts are keeping watch on today's expiry of the april contracts for refined products , especially for gasoline , to set the tone for the oil complex this week. _ much hinges on how gasoline progresses , _ said john saucer , an analyst with smith barney in houston. _ at this point , it_ 's still struggling relative to the rest of the complex. _ tom bentz of ing derivatives in new york seconded that view. _ gasoline still has_ n't exhibited a_lot_of strength. still , saucer pointed out that refinery runs are beginning to pick up in anticipation of the summer driving season. _ the crude market wo_ n't be as sloppy as it has been _ in the weeks ahead , he said. u.s. sour cash crudes were steady although traders expect these grades to lose steam in the weeks ahead. _ if there_ 's one thing we_ 've got plenty_of it_ 's sour , _ said a texas broker. _ i still think we could be below below $3.00 ( discount to wti/cushing ). _ west texas sour/midland was trading around wti/cushing minus $2.40 a barrel late monday morning. swiss-based trader glencore has chartered a ulcc for north sea brent which could arrive on the gulf coast at the end of april , although it_ 's still possible that the trading house could head to south africa instead. the may spread between wti and brent was around $1.35-40 a barrel on monday , a level that would ordinarily discourage transatlantic trade except_for the continued weakness of dated brent. one trader pointed out , however , that improved refining margins are transforming the current crude surplus into a product surplus , a concept that could be borne out in this week's inventory statistics. $-- new york energy desk ( ( +1_212_859 1620 ) )
