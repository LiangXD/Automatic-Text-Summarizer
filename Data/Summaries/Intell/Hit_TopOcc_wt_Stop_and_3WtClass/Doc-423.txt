rice said president bush began the meeting with the words, we're at war, and that director of central intelligence george tenet said the agency was still assessing who was responsible, but the early signs all pointed to al qaeda. for the first time in history, all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the united states were grounded, stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country. ins attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist connections in the chaos after the attacks, it was very difficult to reach law enforcement officials, who were following up on other leads. it passed along a few foreign intelligence reports, including the czech report alleging an april 2001 prague meeting between atta and an iraqi intelligence officer (discussed in chapter 7) and a polish report that personnel at the headquarters of iraqi intelligence in baghdad were told before september 11 to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event. general tommy franks, the commanding general of central command, recalled receiving rumsfeld's guidance that each regional commander should assess what these plans meant for his area of responsibility. the centcom commander told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to iraqi moves shortly after 9/11, both because he personally felt that iraq and al qaeda might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that saddam might take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern or southern parts of iraq, where the united states was flying regular missions to enforce iraqi no-fly zones. within about two months of the start of combat operations, several hundred cia operatives and special forces soldiers, backed by the striking power of u.s. aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support efforts, had combined with afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to destroy thetaliban regime and disrupt al qaeda.
