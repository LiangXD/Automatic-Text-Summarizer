bush plan expected to slow, not halt, gas emission rise president bush is set to announce a plan today calling for voluntary measures to slow but not halt the growth in emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming, white house officials said last night. on another emissions issue unrelated to climate, aides said mr. bush would call today for mandatory restrictions on three other kinds of pollutants from power plants: mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. but environmental groups sharply criticized this kind of yardstick, saying that it merely reflects an existing trend toward using energy more efficiently and adding that as long as the economy grows, this would not result in emissions reductions. one provision of the new climate plan would be to greatly expand a program encouraging businesses to monitor and report their emissions of greenhouse gases. the proposed plan on nongreenhouse emissions from power plants - mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides - would impose mandatory limits but would allow companies to exceed them by buying credits from others that reduce pollution below required levels. in the face of lobbying from coal companies and utilities, mr. bush abandoned a campaign pledge last march to control the four plant emissions together and has shown no signs of reconsidering that idea. it may not be what everyone wants, but it recognizes that the senate is going to deal with climate on its power plant bill.
