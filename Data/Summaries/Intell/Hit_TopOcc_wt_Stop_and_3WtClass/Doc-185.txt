israel's persistent and deliberate fuelling of the cycle of violence in the palestinian territories is pushing our already turbulent region towards inevitable chaos and war. this behaviour further confirms what has long been very clear the government of prime minister ariel sharon is more interested in pursuing its expansionist designs on occupied palestinian and arab land than in engaging in serious peace-making -- a route that would require its unreserved commitment. and therefore, it has blatantly obstructed all international, us, european, and regional efforts to consolidate an israeli-palestinian ceasefire as a prerequisite for the implementation of the mitchell and tenet recommendations. but instead of reciprocating, israel, the state that since its creation has benefited most from us protection and backing, has turned out to be a fair-weather friend. sharon's likening of his invasion of palestinian territories and the assassinations to the us-led war against the taleban and osama ben laden is abhorrent. as the entire world is engaged in handling one of the most serious crises of our time, it is about time that sharon and his government realise that predatory behaviour will not be tolerated for long. the calls from washington and london for the just and legitimate realisation of palestinian statehood as part of such a settlement, should be viewed by the israeli leadership as a guarantee of israel's peace and security, but continued violence and aggression, as history has shown time and again, is a recipe for disaster.
