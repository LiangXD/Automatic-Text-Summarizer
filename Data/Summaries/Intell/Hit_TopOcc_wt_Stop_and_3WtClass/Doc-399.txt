harare, zimbabwe: a defiant president robert mugabe said his party had lost ground to the opposition through complacency, but would win this weekend's presidential elections anyway, state radio reported on tuesday. security forces tortured opponents, ruling party militants abducted people, and police arrested opposition supporters who were themselves the victims of crimes. in his speech on monday, mugabe thanked african leaders for refusing to buckle to pressure to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth of britain and its former territories at a summit of the 54-nation grouping in australia. britain, australia, canada and new zealand demanded the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth to protest state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses against the opposition. mugabe said the decision to defer the possible suspension until commonwealth observers report back on the election was a victory against britain's attempts to introduce a new form of apartheid to serve western interests in developing countries. tendai biti, the mdc's foreign affairs spokesman, said mugabe was trying to hide his policies of violence and intimidation behind his rift with britain. the state-run herald newspaper, a government mouthpiece, said tuesday british prime minister tony blair had showed personal arrogance, an obsession with mugabe and the shallowness of his commitment to democracy.
