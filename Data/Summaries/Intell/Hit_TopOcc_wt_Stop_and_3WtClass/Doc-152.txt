but it was the uncertainty with which her rival, bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union, the cdu's bavarian sister party, also shrouded himself that made the question of who would lead the union parties into the 22 september elections as chancellor candidate against incumbent gerhard schroeder, so exciting. mr. stoiber has come a long way from his refusal to sacrifice himself for the cdu in an election that once looked impossible to win, through his statement that he would under no circumstances run against the wishes of ms. merkel and her party, to his willingness to take her on in a divisive vote if necessary. but he let slip the opportunities to turn back, because the forces that drive him -- his desire to affect change, his sense of duty to his peers and his ambition -- would not permit him to pass up the biggest chance of his political life. certainly, mr. stoiber has done everything in his power to spare himself the fate of his mentor, franz josef strauss. the most cogent argument in mr. stoiber's favor is that he will be running as a hopeful and not as the ticket of last resort. nonetheless, he will be made to realize that he cannot command the cdu, that his power base lies in munich and not in berlin, and that the invitation of kingmakers to accept the crown comes at a cost. nor will mr. stoiber have any illusions of what it means to lead an election campaign, although he can be confident in the knowledge that what is at stake is not edmund stoiber, nor the union, but germany as a whole.
