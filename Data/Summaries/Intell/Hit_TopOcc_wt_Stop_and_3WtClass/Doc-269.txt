rjr nabisco inc. said it agreed to sell its baby ruth, butterfinger and pearson candy businesses to nestle s.a.'s nestle foods unit for $370 million. the sale, at a higher price than some analysts had expected, helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts nestle's 7% share of the u.s. candy market to about 12%. the candy businesses had sales of about $154 million last year, which was roughly 12% of total revenue for rjr's planters lifesavers unit, according to a memorandum distributed by rjr's owner, kohlberg kravis roberts & co., to bankers last december. roughly $2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales, and rjr expects to use another $2 billion from the pending, two-part sale of most of its del monte unit. louis gerstner jr., chairman and chief executive officer of new york-based rjr, called the sale a significant step in the company's divestiture program, as well as a a strategic divestiture. baby ruth and butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the u.s., but rjr's overall share of the roughly $5.1 billion market is less than 5%. nestle's share of 7% before friday's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders hershey foods corp. and mars inc., which have about 40% and 36% of the market, respectively.
