yoo choon-sik seoul 1997-03-31 south korea on monday raised the ceiling for foreign share-ownership by three percentage points , but analysts said they saw little short-term impact on the local stock market because_of poor fundamentals. the finance ministry said it would raise the aggregate foreign ownership ceiling to 23 percent of a listed company from the current 20 percent , effective from may 1. ministry officials said the move , along_with other steps to open wider the local capital market , was aimed at attracting foreign funds to put a brake on the local currency's fall. analysts welcomed the move , but said immediate beneficiaries would be limited to a handful of blue chips in which foreigners are interested. most other firms would be ignored unless their economic fundamentals improved , they said. _ i do_ n't think foreigners will turn aggressive ( buyers ) unless the current account turns around , _ said lee keun-mo , head of research at ing-baring securities. _ i do_ n't expect much from the announcement. _ the ministry said it expected the increased ceiling to bring a further $3 billion into the market , but securities analysts estimated the fresh inflow of funds at between $500 million and $600 million. analysts said the country's growing current account deficit and the resulting depreciation of the won are the main factors discouraging foreign investment in local stocks. the aggregate foreign ownership ceiling on _ strategically important _ pohang iron and korea electric power corp will be raised to 18 percent from the current 15 percent.
