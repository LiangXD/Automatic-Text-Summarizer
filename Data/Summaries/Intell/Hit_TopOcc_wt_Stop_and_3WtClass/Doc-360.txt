blair not happy with new green deal the british prime minister, tony blair, disagreed yesterday with australia's decision to sign a climate change deal with the united states. the federal government denied that the agreement, signed this week, was a signal it was dumping the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases. the australian-us climate action partnership involves liaison between governments, businesses and research bodies on climate change. critics say that on the one hand australia is saying it does not want to dump kyoto, yet on the other it is cosying up to the us - which does want to dump kyoto. australia's involvement in kyoto has been in doubt ever since the us president, george bush, announced last year that ratifying the protocol would hurt the us economy. a spokeswoman for the environment minister, david kemp, said yesterday that the minister was on his way to talks with the european union in brussels after a formal visit to washington, and that the government was still committed to kyoto. the opposition's environment spokesman, kelvin thomson, said yesterday that australia should not follow the us position on climate change.
