so let me rephrase the remodeling-roi question this way: what are some cost-effective ways to improve the livability of your house? take excess windows from bedrooms and baths and use them to connect the inside of the house with the outside. 5. spend more time planning, and less money building i toured a client’s existing home before we began designing the new one. “of course,” she said as we peeked in on the kids’ rooms, “these bedrooms are way too small.” really? make the toilet and a sink in the master bath accessible to the rest of the house, instead of building a separate half bath – it won’t be used much by you during the day, and rarely by guests at night. compartmentalized bath – two baths in the space of one and a half each kid doesn’t need his/her own bath, but they do need privacy and room to share. a compartmentalized bath puts two sinks in one room and the toilet and tub/shower in another – so three kids can use the bath at once and keep a little more harmony in the family home. but every one saves you money over a more “conventional” design strategy, and every one increases the livability of your home.
