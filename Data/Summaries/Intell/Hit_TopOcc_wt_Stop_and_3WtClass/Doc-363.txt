taiwan caucus a us provocation: commentary on april 9, the 23rd anniversary of the united states ' troublemaking taiwan relations act, the us congress is due to unveil a 70-member taiwan caucus. on a more dangerous level, it may provide fodder to taiwan's military forces and play into the hands of taiwan separatist extremists. in mid-march, the us side granted taiwan defence minister tang yiau-ming a visa so he could attend a conference sponsored by us military contractors in florida. on march 22, admiral dennis blair, commander-in-chief of the us pacific command, told the house armed services committee that the united states and taiwan can maintain a military balance across the taiwan straits if both sides continue modernizing their armed forces. last wednesday when receiving a special delegation from the us house of representatives, chen said that the strong support of the us congress - which led to us arms sales to taiwan in april last year - ensured a balanced cross-straits military situation and peace in the taiwan straits. president bush reaffirmed the us promises to all taiwanese and repeatedly declared he would abide by the taiwan relations act - to provide taiwan with the necessary protection against beijing, chen was quoted by the taipei times as saying. since the latest remarks and events may give these forces the impression that the united states is on their side and ready to provide military protection, they may become provocative enough to push the island to the edge.
