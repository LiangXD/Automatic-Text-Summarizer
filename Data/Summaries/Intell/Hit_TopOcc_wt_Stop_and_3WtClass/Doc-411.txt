with the help of friends like you, goodwill has continued to adapt our services to meet the human needs of our changing society. the gift that i am asking you to make will be used to continue our mission of helping people prepare for, find and keep jobs. in their december, 1995 review of the nation's best charities, u.s. news & world report called goodwill one of the five standout good guys. while i appreciate u.s. news & world report's endorsement, the true value of your support is measured by the way goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us. every time we help someone find a solution to their employment barrier, the positive effects radiate throughout our community: the business community welcomes not only another worker, but a consumer with increased purchasing power. at goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results i see every day: a goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients: you can earn the money to support yourself and your family, she says. a participant in a goodwill program rushes back from a job interview to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing training program. once his tears have subsided, he confirms what his classmates have already figured out: he just received a job offer -- his first in five years.
