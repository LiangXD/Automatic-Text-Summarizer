as you can see from the enclosed map, your target store is located in the heart of four of our service areas. the centers that serve these areas, mary rigg neighborhood center, hawthorne community center, southwest multi-service center, and christamore house, have teamed up to run an exciting job readiness program for 14 and 15 year old area residents called the summer enrichment program. between june 21 and august 31, 45 youth will spend 20 hours a week developing life management and work ethic skills, learning the computer, visiting area colleges, and interacting with guest speakers. we would like to offer our youth a small reward for their participation by presenting them with gift certificates from target. therefore, we are asking you to donate 45, $10 gift certificates that can be used toward the purchase of school supplies or clothing, in the total amount of $450. target is well known for it's support of the community, and we believe that the summer enrichment program represents your interests and concerns quite well. i will be happy to supply any additional information you may need and thank you for your consideration of our request.
