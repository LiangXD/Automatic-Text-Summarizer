please believe me , i '_ m ill me sufferers are sick of doctors not taking them seriously and have made a cinema ad to win support for their case. it '_ s your head that needs them , not your legs. & equo & bquo women of your age imagine aches and pains ? are you sure you '_ re not attention seeking ? & equo & bquo we all have to die sometimes. & equo & bquo i '_ m not prepared to do any tests. i wish you '_ d take yourself away from me. & equo & bquo you middle class women have nothing_else to worry about. & equo & bquo it '_ s one of those things you silly young women get. & equo & bquo stop feeling sorry for yourself. i have patients with real illnesses ? patients who are dying from cancer. & equo & bquo go home and have more babies. & equo surgery encounters like these have become increasingly common over the past 30 years with the erosion of the traditional divisions between sickness and health , which have led to , among other things , the medicalisation of & bquo anxiety. & equo. doctors are now increasingly reluctant to prescribe tranquillisers for fear of being sued by patients who become addicted to them. this theory has it that , as a breed , doctors like to be masters of every possible situation , and that this may even be a factor in their selection of medicine as a career. the action campaign is also seeking support from medical journalists , and i have been asked repeatedly if i was going to add to the & bquo adverse & equo me publicity.
