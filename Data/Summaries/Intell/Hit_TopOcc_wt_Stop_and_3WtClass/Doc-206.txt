many countries in asia, europe, africa, and latin america have rejected the content of the us human rights report, calling it a brazen distortion of the situation, a wrongful and illegitimate move, and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. the united states has been preparing annual reports on human rights in 190 countries for 25 years while ignoring the real situation at home. world analysts remarked that the us evaluation of the practice of human rights in other countries depends on the level of political relations between the united states and those countries. this year, the us report devotes many pages to commenting on human rights in the democratic people's republic of korea and iraq. however, such a criticism is absent in the 2001 human rights report as the united states is planning to try the al-qa'ida and taliban detainees in military courts while refusing to grant them pow status. in light of the united states' malicious goals, its annual human rights report for 2001 is facing strong protest and criticism from the world. the washington times last weekend carried an article by andrew welsdan, a representative of the us fund for reconciliation and development, rejecting the report's allegation of human rights in vietnam.
