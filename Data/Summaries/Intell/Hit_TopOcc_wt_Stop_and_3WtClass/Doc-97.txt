david lawder detroit 1997-03-31 continuing at a steady but unspectacular pace , u.s. car and truck sales for march are expected to show gains for japanese and german automakers at the expense of detroit's big three , analysts said monday. both chrysler corp. and ford motor co. are expected to report march sales declines of about 3 percent , compared with a year ago , while general motors corp. may post gains of 3 percent to 6 percent over last year's strike-affected results. analysts said japanese automakers are expected to continue increasing sales and market share , based on a hot portfolio of new products coupled with a weak japanese yen that allows them to price more aggressively. _ it still sounds pretty sloppy. this year's market is very competitive , _ said schroder wertheim analyst john casesa. _ the march numbers are going to show that the market is not as robust as the annual rate suggests. _ analysts estimate that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for march light vehicle sales will be about 15 million to 15.4 million units , compared with 15.5 million a year ago. ford's truck sales are expected to be up 2 percent to 3 percent , while chrysler's truck sales are expected to be flat to down 1 percent. _ the spring selling season has_ n't really yet gotten underway so it_ 's likely they_ 'll be down a_little_bit , _ chrysler chairman robert eaton said of chrysler's overall results. but gm's improved sales are not expected to be enough to offset the market share gains by toyota motor corp. , honda motor co. ltd. and other japanese automakers , particular in the intermediate passenger car market. german automakers , including audi ag and mercedes-benz ag , are also expected to show improvements , adding to impressive market share gains of a full percentage point through the first two months of the year.
