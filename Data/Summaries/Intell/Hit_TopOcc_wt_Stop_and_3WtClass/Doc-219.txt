and now andrey gudkov, an expert at the center for strategic studies, follows budyko in insisting that russia, as well as canada and alaska, gain, since lands situated in a condition of permafrost will gradually turn into fertile soils for agricultural production. in his view, it would not be a bad idea, when the scientific community draws up all sorts of forecasts and plans of action that flow out of them, for it to seek help from the science of paleoclimatology and to gain a broad understanding of its data. models are flawed, including the greenhouse model, and the only thing that is beyond dispute is that warming is underway, and the contribution of human beings to this alarming condition is very large, possible at least 30 percent. some of the participants took the line that this is an extremely useful for russia, which has hot air (that is, it is 30 percent short of the permitted level of co2 emissions), and the country can become the dominant seller in the market consequently, it has a greater stake than anyone in the ratification of the kyoto protocol. the obligations of foreign countries under the kyoto protocol developed countries and transitional economies must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 by at least 5 percent from the recognized baseline year of 1990. this approach is based on the fact that russia's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990, and, according to forecasts, the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years. our institute, along with the institute of systems analysis and the russian academy of sciences computer center, has begun studying the role of climate change in individual regions of russia in order to forecast economic development.
