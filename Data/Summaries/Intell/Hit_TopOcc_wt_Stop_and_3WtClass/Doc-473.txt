san salvador, 17 april (acan-efe) -- salvadorian president, francisco flores, today defended his declaration of support for the interim venezuelan government headed by industrialist pedro carmona, indicating that the information that he had at the time was that hugo chavez had resigned the presidency. flores said, in a press conference, that there is no reason to apologize to president chavez, as demanded by salvadoran opposition parties. flores maintained that this is a position that is not unique to el salvador it is the position of all the european countries, it is the position of the united states this is in our view totally reasonable when so little information is available. the salvadorian president considered that the vote of confidence in the provisional government of carmona will not have any repercussions in relations between el salvador and venezuela, which he described as totally normal, we are not worried in that sense. he indicated that the democratic charter is a new instrument and implies that the oas countries members convene a tribunal to investigate the case of a country and decide whether or not to remove it from the international community of which it is part something that is a tremendously serious process. asked what repercussions an announced visit to venezuela-by leaders of the opposition party farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln, left wing)-would have for his government, flores said that my concern is that they may be seeking to cause damage to the country. there is no international problem, but rather a manipulation of the subject domestically and once again i want to ask the fmln that it does not cause damage to this country.
