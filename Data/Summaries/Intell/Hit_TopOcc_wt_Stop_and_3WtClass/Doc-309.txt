what they said: no tears for tobin, but some for al-qaeda ottawa - the plight of prisoners and politicians has been weighing heavily on the minds of editorial writers and pundits in and around the nation's capital. it's been a week now since jean chretien's cabinet shuffle and the dramatic departure of brian tobin -- seven days during which the print pundits have had time to ponder his actions. still, before discussing the antics of mr. tobin and the elevation of ottawa's john manley to the status of golden boy, there is the controversial, and more pressing, matter of the plight of the al-qaeda fighters imprisoned at a u.s. military base in cuba. no tears will be shed in this corner since brian tobin's departure represents his third consecutive betrayal of voters, walter robinson, federal director of the canadian taxpayers federation and a regular columnist in the ottawa sun wrote yesterday. mr. tobin seems content to be back home on the rock playing with his bag of marbles and collecting his parliamentary pension. he also wrote that while the former minister may have been one of the longest-serving mps, he was also one of the most unstable, noting his career was like a rough sea, with highs and lows and never calm. in the kingston whig-standard paul schliesmann writes, canadians don't need the kind of politician brian tobin had become -- flighty, opportunistic and lacking in commitment to his job as a member of parliament.
