zimbabwe's president is sworn in subhead: lawmakers boycott event author: by jon jeter harare, zimbabwe - president robert mugabe was sworn in sunday for his fifth term in office following a bitterly fought election that the opposition and many western governments denounced as rigged. speaking publicly for the first time since government election officials declared him the winner four days ago, mugabe returned to the themes he struck during his campaign against morgan tsvangirai, a former trade union leader. he told an audience assembled in the colonial-style state house mansion that his victory was a triumph against the west and whites who he said had aligned against him and his governing party, the zimbabwe african national union-patriotic front. all said they were protesting an election they said had been tainted by months of political violence and intimidation, last-minute changes to electoral laws, and the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters in harare -- an opposition stronghold -- who failed to vote because the government reduced the number of polling stations. mugabe, 78, remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program, under which the country's most fertile land has been seized from white commercial farmers for redistribution to poor, landless blacks. south african president thabo mbeki and nigerian president olusegun obasanjo are pressing mugabe to accept such an arrangement to avoid deepening international sanctions and suspension from the commonwealth of britain and its former colonies. investors and western diplomats have said they might interpret mbeki's support for mugabe or the elections as a sign that africa is not intent on revitalizing its economies through good government and expanded international trade.
