in the battle against the new forms of terrorism that reached a tragic culmination on 11 september, a limited form of military violence could also not be ruled out. the many and often confusing reports we have received over recent weeks on who may be responsible for the attacks already allows a clear pattern to be detected. the network with which usama bin ladin and his followers tried to destroy the very foundations of the west has ramifications worldwide, vast amounts of money, and thanks to the taliban regime in afghanistan also a number of excellent training and attack bases. the united states and its principal allies have acted with exceptional caution over recent weeks to the unbelievable provocation of the 11 september attacks. they took pains to build a broad coalition, and tried to make it clear to their own population and the international community that the enemy is not islam but a very well defined and perverse interpretation of this religion. that is a clear condition for this first, unavoidable phase in the battle against terrorism to be humanly acceptable. but they cannot be any real talk of success until the broad strategy against terrorism begins to bear fruit.
