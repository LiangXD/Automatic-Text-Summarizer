c'wealth mission conduct questionable by a special correspondent - britain's prime minister, tony blair, privately did two things concerning zimbabwe during the recent retreat by commonwealth leaders in australia that raise questions about today's meeting in london by the troika of australia, nigeria and south africa. the first was that blair said he had received an interim report from the commonwealth observer mission to zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote. the commonwealth leaders, many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between zimbabwe and its former coloniser, britain, breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process. while the commonwealth observer mission and many of the foreign journalists were assembled in the hotel, the opposition leader of the movement for democratic change (mdc), morgan tsvangirai, moved in with them, taking a complete floor for himself and his entourage. a namibian woman member of the commonwealth observer mission, who is the well-respected, deputy speaker of the national council in her country, held different views to those stated in the interim commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known. the final straw that confirmed that australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the australian prime minister, john howard, ordered his high commissioner in harare not to attend sunday's inauguration of robert mugabe as president of zimbabwe. these are some of the realities that presidents obasanjo of nigeria and thabo mbeki of south africa, confronted as they flew from harare last night for their meeting in london tomorrow with the australian leader who is the third member of the commonwealth troika.
