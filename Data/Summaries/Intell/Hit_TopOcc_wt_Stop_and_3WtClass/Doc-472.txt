this is far out of tune with the attitude the united states used to take when a coup occurred in other countries. just as venezuela restored its constitutional rule and chavez was returned to power, the new york times came up with a shocking story: the us government and senior military officials were in contact with the venezuelan coup organizers. maurer for western hemisphere affairs met with venezuelan armed forces supreme commander and inspector general lucas rincon in december of last year and made it clear to the latter that the united ! why didn't the united states inform venezuela's constitutional government of the coup attempt by rincon and the others? after taking the office of presidency, chavez has implemented an independent foreign policy and seemed to be not in step with the united states in many respects. the only guideline determining us rejection or support of the government of a [foreign] country is whether it follows us baton and whether its domestic and foreign policies are in accord with the us national interests. hence one can see that it is not to be surprised that the united states chimed in with the venezuela's coup organizers.
