harare -- opposition leader morgan tsvangirai has accused zimbabwean president robert mugabe of deliberately withholding food from some areas of the drought-ravaged country as punishment for not voting the correct way in march's election. mr. tsvangirai, the 50-year-old leader of the movement for democratic change, alleged in an interview that a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution the ruling zanu-pf has waged against him and his supporters. the united nations world food program warned last week that as many as 1.5 million zimbabweans face starvation from the drought, compounded by government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms that have crippled production of maize and wheat. mr. mugabe acknowledged the country's agricultural problems last week, declaring a state of disaster brought on by drought and sabotage by white farmers. we have come across cases of people having to have a zanu-pf card before they are allowed to buy from the grain marketing board, which is the body that controls imports and sales. mr. tsvangirai also touched on his own legal battle with the government: on may 31, he is to stand trial on a charge of treason, accused of plotting to have mr. mugabe assassinated. the opposition leader has denied the charge all along, and although he was reluctant to go into depth about a case still before the courts, he did make brief reference to the prosecution's star witness, montreal-based consultant and former israeli intelligence agent ari ben-menashe, who may or may not travel to zimbabwe for the trial.
