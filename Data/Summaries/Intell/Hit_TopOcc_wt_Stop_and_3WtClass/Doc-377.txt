when argentina barreled toward a similar default in recent weeks, it was mr. bush who had to make the bailout call - and his decision was to let argentina suffer the consequences of its own economic mismanagement. still, mr. bush's reaction to the biggest international economic crisis so far in his presidency is a telling example of a new - and perhaps risky - approach to the kind of national economic bankruptcies that dominated washington's dealings with the world's emerging markets in the late 1990's. but the first time his approach was tested, when turkey ran into deep trouble last spring, mr. bush's national security aides warned that it was no time to abandon a well-located ally whose government seemed willing to take the medicine the international monetary fund prescribed. it is a message that mr. bush's aides said in interviews this week that they hoped would force officials of developing countries and foreign investors to work out their problems without relying as much on huge aid packages from the international monetary fund and from washington, which became commonplace after mexico. already there is considerable doubt that argentina will now agree to the kind of hemispheric free-trade agreement that mr. bush himself, with mr. de la r? his side, said last year was a major goal of his administration. the critics of mr. bush's decision to pull the plug on aid argue that the i.m.f. and the bush administration were callous for abandoning an ally at a sensitive moment. they pulled the plug, one senior administration official said, only when it became clear that the collapse was going to happen sooner or later, and there was no use spending billions to get a few more weeks before the inevitable happened.
