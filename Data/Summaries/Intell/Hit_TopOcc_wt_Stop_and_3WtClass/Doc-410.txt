december 10, 1996 dear mailhouse donor reminder: you and i have done some important work together. we've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce. we've expanded goodwill's proven methods to towns and neighborhoods where they are needed most. goodwill has devised the programs that turned your investment into results. when you and i help somebody find a job, one more person joins the ranks of tax payers, fewer tax dollars are spent on public assistance and businesses gain another consumer. there are a lot of barriers that keep people from working: physical and mental disabilities, history of welfare dependency and lack of education or self-esteem. and there are a lot of people who face these challenges every day of their lives.
