i often feel as if i only get half the story sometimes, so i typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than i will ever need. i think that is why i welcomed doing a book--it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism. much of it, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some very good stories. i personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of microsoft on just one man--at aol, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other characters, for lack of a better word. steve ballmer, of course, is now getting a lot more attention at microsoft, but it still seems to be bill's show over there. while i did not attend the trial--i was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of bill gates took a beating and the insular culture of microsoft did not look so good. i always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whether it is aol or microsoft or disney--is in charge of all our destinies: babylon was.
