bagram, afghanistan, dec 7 (afp) - in a foretaste of resistance to foreign peacekeepers by the northern alliance, an uneasy atmosphere reigns between us forces and their afghan allies at the bagram airbase north of kabul. although northern alliance control the main entrance to the base, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of kabul, just inside the perimeter there is a checkpoint manned by heavily-armed us soldiers. a contingent of the us 10th mountain division has taken up base at bagram, joining some 150 british marines, to establish a humanitarian air corridor for international aid but also to ensure security at the crucial airbase. the top alliance commander in the area, general babajan, driving out of the base to inspect positions along with some us and british officers, good naturedly shrugged off any problem. he said that northern alliance commanders were irritated by images of armed us soldiers on afghan soil, and so media access to the base had to be temporarily suspended. ironically, some 200 armed russians, who appeared to be from the military although they were dressed in uniforms of russia's emergencies ministry, set up camp 10 days ago in the centre of kabul. but russia, which armed the alliance throughout its five-year civil war with the taliban, has offered unequivocal political support for the loose coalition of ethnic minorities which swept into kabul on november 13.
