russian ship might have missed proper linkup with space station cape canaveral -- (ap) -- a russian supply ship docked to the international space station on wednesday, but may not have latched properly into place. nasa officials said it was not clear whether the potential problem would delay tonight's planned launch of space shuttle endeavour on a station delivery mission. the unmanned progress ship, carrying more than a ton of food, fuel and other supplies, was launched from kazakstan on monday. it pulled up to the space station right on time, and the linkup initially appeared to go well. but nasa later said russian flight controllers outside moscow did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had closed and latched. the space station's steering system, turned off for the docking, remained off an extra three hours to give russian flight controllers time to study the problem. everything was turned back on after russian engineers determined the supply ship was attached securely enough for the steering system to operate.
