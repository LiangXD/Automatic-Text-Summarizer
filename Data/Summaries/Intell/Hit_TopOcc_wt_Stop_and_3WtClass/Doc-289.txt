lowell said some small-arms fire was directed at us troops on the kandahar base after the aircraft took off in the early evening afghanistan time, but that the c-17 was not fired upon. a us marine spokesman in kandahar told cnn late on thursday that the gunfire came from snipers that penetrated the outer perimeter of the base and was not believed to be linked to the transfer of prisoners. in washington, us defense officials earlier said that unprecedented security -- including chains and possibly sedation and hoods -- might be used in transporting the prisoners, who include members of bin laden's al-qaeda guerrilla network. one of the officials, who asked not to be identified, said that planning called for the prisoners, not yet charged with crimes, to be manacled together and outnumbered by specially trained guards carrying incapacitating stun guns. others confirmed a report in usa today that consideration was being given to tranquilizing some of the detainees and perhaps even covering their heads with hoods for flights that would take more than 12 hours. the pentagon refused to discuss details of the transfer, and defence department spokeswoman victoria clarke said on thursday that no announcements would be made until the first detainees arrived at the secluded base, where a high-security, barbed wire-enclosed facility is being built. hundreds of us military police and marine corps reinforcements have been flown to the gitmo base, as it is called, in cuba and prisoners will be held inside a compound ringed by two fences topped with razor wire.
