parallel lines to the future : britain is among the front runners as tomorrow '_ s supercomputers take shape , says greg wilson by greg wilson from desk-top micros to the largest mainframes , conventional computers are built around a single processor and a single store of memory. would it be possible to re-use old programs written for conventional machines , or would users have to start from scratch and throw away their existing investment in software ? there are now manufacturers world-wide pursuing variations on this approach , building everything from high-powered graphics work stations for computer-aided design and advertising , like soon-to-merge american firms ardent and stellar , through to teradata , another american company which has sold several hundred of its parallel database machines , to britain '_ s meiko scientific , manufacturer of the computing surface. faced with the loss of their previous high-performance computer in 1987 , the university got backing from the science and engineering research council and the department of trade and industry to purchase a large computing surface to serve both as a research vehicle and a flagship site for meiko. modern science is critically dependent on high-performance computing studies of the world '_ s changing climate , structural engineering , and medical imaging simply could not have progressed to their present state without access to the sort of computing power that can only be provided by parallel machines. his group has been involved in parallel computing since the early 1980s software produced at caltech has become a de_facto standard for the various & bquo hypercube & equo machines manufactured in the united states. now that caltech '_ s operating environment is being marketed commercially by parasoft under the name express , and with meiko '_ s introduction of a machine-independent programming system called cs tools , a single , uniform environment is becoming increasingly likely.
