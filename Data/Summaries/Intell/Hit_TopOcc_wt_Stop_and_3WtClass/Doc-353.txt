beijing: china played down sensitive differences with the united states over taiwan on thursday, with president jiang zemin holding his tongue over us commitments to arm the diplomatically-isolated island. jiang portrayed talks with us president george w. bush on the issue as low-key, telling reporters both sides had expressed opposition to 'taiwan independence' and the hope of solving the taiwan question peacefully. jiang said bush had restated washington's long-standing commitment to beijing's one china policy, which states that taiwan and the mainland belong to a single country. but in a clear signal of continued support for taiwan, bush said he would honour a pledge to help arm the island china has regarded as a rebel province since a 1949 civil war split. bush's statement will come as a relief to taiwan, which has been watching his two-day visit closely fearing washington may give something new away to china in return for beijing's support for the us-led war on terrorism, analysts said. bush stands firm washington angered beijing last year by offering taiwan the biggest arms package in a decade -- including submarines for the first time -- and saying washington would do whatever it takes to protect the island. china had demanded that washington end arms sales to taiwan and step back from explicit statements of support for the island, which beijing has threatened to attack if it declares independence or delays reunification talks indefinitely.
