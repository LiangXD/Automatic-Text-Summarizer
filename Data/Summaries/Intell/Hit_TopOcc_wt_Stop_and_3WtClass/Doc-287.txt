anxiety arises, however, from the sense that the cultural gulf between these prisoners and their captors is so vast that the latter genuinely do not see how a diet of peanut butter and bagel chips can be considered cruel and inhuman punishment. one can feel sorry for the hapless vanquished now on that limbo rock in the caribbean, and hope that some might follow the threads of their tortured consciences back out of the labyrinth, having duly met and been eaten by the minotaur. still, it might be doubly difficult for the afghans among them ever to go back, if the new administration of their home country goes ahead with rebuilding the buddhas of bamiyan for their potential as a tourist attraction. it's been almost a year since the taliban blew up those monumental 1,500-year-old sandstone statues in northcentral afghanistan, at which time the only way for the rest of us to handle the insult to human sensibilities was to emulate the gautama buddha himself, and profess relief. his clothes probably never looked quite like that - the statues' fashion sense had been clearly influenced by the greeks, what with alexander the great having passed through on his way to giving up with india. of all the unconscionable things the taliban did to afghan society in the six years of their reign, their demolition of the buddhas of bamiyan last march cleaved the rift between civilisations that was rammed wide open by hijacked aircraft over america just six months later, and which the us has since cauterised with the molten metal of its military might. and so it has come ironically to pass that, one year on, a new afghan order is dreaming of rebuilding those statues, while what's left of the taliban now sits in cells a world away, beardless, bald and clad in saffron.
