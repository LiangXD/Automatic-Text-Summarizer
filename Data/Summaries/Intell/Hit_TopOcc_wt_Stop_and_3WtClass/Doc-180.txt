but commons leader mr cook said: if you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put british troops into the ground civil war and i don't myself imagine that's going to change. british troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was better than anybody could have hoped for , according to mr cook. we will continue obviously to keep the situation under review, but frankly, i think we should welcome the fact that their presence has not been needed in afghanistan. but that did not stop taliban commanders discussing the surrender of kandahar, following calls from 70 afghan tribal leaders for them to avert bloodshed. ruud lubbers, the united nations commissioner for refugees, said afghanistan was not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in and not enough food had been taken into the country. but the prime minister's official spokesman today said tony blair was pleased with the progress that had been made on the military, diplomatic and humanitarian fronts. in terms of the war on terrorism we have always said this is a multi-faceted campaign but equally we have also said any future military action would have to be based on evidence, he said.
