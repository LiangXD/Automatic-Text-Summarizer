registrar general tobaiwa mudede announced on state television that mugabe was re-elected with 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,758 votes for tsvangirai, leader of the movement for democratic change (mdc). as the results were being announced, about 100 heavily armed soldiers moved into zimbabwe's second city bulawayao and surrounded the mdc offices, where opposition officials had gathered. british foreign secretary jack straw cited 'pretty strong' evidence that mugabe has 'stolen' zimbabwe's vote, an outcome he said would have 'enormous implications for the nature of our relationship with zimbabwe.' of 882,176 people registered to vote in harare province, 439,656 or 49.8 per cent actually did so during the three days of polling that began saturday and saw mile-long queues across the capital. the mdc, charging that the mugabe government had followed a deliberate strategy of impeding the urban vote, went to the high court and won an extra day of voting on monday, but polls opened several hours late, and only an additional 24,000 votes were cast. 'the election was preceded by months of government-orchestrated violence meant to intimidate voters (and) the opposition was repeatedly harassed and prevented from campaigning,' she said. ncube, along with tsvangirai and four other top party officials, had been accused last month of plotting to assassinate the president.
