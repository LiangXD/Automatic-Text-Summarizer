polly peck, a fast-growing british conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new shares of sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions. statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike sansui, which is listed on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges, most of the japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held. usually when a japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of sansui's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour. yoshihisa murasawa, a management consultant for booz-allen & hamilton (japan) inc., said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future. whether polly peck's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen, but at the news conference, mr. nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn sansui around. sansui, he said, is a perfect fit for polly peck's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an original equipment maker basis for sale under other companies' brand names. and while polly peck isn't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of sansui, it is bringing in a former toshiba corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer.
