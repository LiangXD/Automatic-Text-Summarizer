courtaulds plc announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value. the british chemical and textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create a new, listed u.k. stock with a probable market capitalization between #300 million ($473 million) and #400 million, analysts said. courtaulds' spinoff reflects pressure on british industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders. some analysts have said courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined. in addition, courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities. even without a specific takeover threat, courtaulds is giving shareholders choice and value, said julia blake, an analyst at london stockbrokers barclays de zoete wedd. courtaulds chairman and chief executive sir christopher hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff.
