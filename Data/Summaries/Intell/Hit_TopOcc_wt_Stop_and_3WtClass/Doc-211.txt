its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish china's image and exert political pressure on the chinese government, human rights experts said at a seminar held by the china society for study of human rights (csshr) on friday. the united states was slandering china again, said xirao-nima, a professor of tibetan history at the central university for nationalities. after a visit to tibet in 2000, the italian parliamentary delegation issued a press communique agreeing that the development of tibet is far better than what has been reported by some western media. the italian senator's words are in sharp contrast to what was contained in the so-called china human rights report compiled by the united states, which blindly accuses china of restricting religious freedom in tibet. to back up their reckless conclusion, the report lists many incidents where it said religious freedom was violated. those that want to secede from the nation and engage in terrorist activities are terrorists, not any particular ethnic group, said ma dazheng, director of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region's development research institute at the chinese academy of social sciences. the united states often says that although al-qaida members and the taliban are muslims, us troops are bombing them because they are terrorists, not muslims, he said.
