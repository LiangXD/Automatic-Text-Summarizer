addressing the meeting, denktas said that this week is "martryrs week," adding that "it is the 38th anniversary of the struggle started to annihilate turks in cyprus...we fought for half of our lives to prevent the occupation of cyprus from greece and not to make the island a greek dagger that is thrust into the heart of anatolia. noting that the agreements signed in 1960 for cyprus were considered as nonexistent by many countries, denktas said that the international society treated the island as if it was a greek cypriot republic and treated its turkish partner as if it was a minority. denktas said that they are ready to live together with greek cypriots in the island, adding that they don't have the will to send greek cypriots from the island. denktas noted that there is no cypriot nation in the island and there can't be a minority if there is no nation, stressing that he will launch efforts to make cyprus a friendship bridge between turkey and greece. calling on the representatives of the turkish world who attended the congress, denktas said that turkish cypriots are not minority in the island and representatives should explain this fact in every place which they visit. also asking for help from the turkish press, denktas said that "i ask for help from the press as i will negotiate for peace and compromise to solve cyprus question. i would like these representatives to explain the fact to the eu, which forgot the 1960 constitution that the turkish cypriots are not minority and the greek cypriot side which wants to join the eu unilaterally and as if it was the legitimate government of cyprus is not expected in the eu."
