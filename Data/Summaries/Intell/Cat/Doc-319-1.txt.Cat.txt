AFTER SPENDING months in frigid Afghanistan caves subsisting on Allah knows what, the 158 detainees the United States is holding in tropical Guantanamo Bay must think they've died and gone to heaven. The detainees should look at the balmy Camp X-ray -- replete with running water, three square meals a day and modern medical care -- as a sort of Taliban version of Club Med. Amnesty International issued a press release accusing the United States of keeping prisoners incommunicado, (using) sensory deprivation, the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them in an effort to 'break' the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation. It should be noted that much of the uproar is over photographs of the detainees taken as they were being transported from airplanes to their cells. Does Amnesty International think that wearing a hood on an airplane is sensory deprivation, instead of a security measure? As for the unnecessary restraint, one detainee has announced that he wants to kill an American before he leaves Cuba, and another detainee bit a guard, according to Pentagon spokesman Capt. Then there's the reporter who asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld if American Taliban John Walker will be treated the same as the detainees. The detainee status however, gives the U.S. military the leeway to interrogate these former operatives about any future terrorist attacks. White House spokesman Ken Lisaius rightly noted of the Club Gitmo guests that, for the most part, they're members of al Qaeda and if they were free, they'd engage in murder once again. You could understand the outrage if the U.S. military were torturing or otherwise mistreating the detainees. Instead, Amnesty International and the comrades are outraged that the military is treating al Qaeda captives like prisoners.
