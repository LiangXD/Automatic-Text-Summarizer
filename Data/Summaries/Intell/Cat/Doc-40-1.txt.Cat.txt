Yeom Yoon-jeong SEOUL 1997-03-31 South Korea's ailing won shot up 2.25 percent against the dollar on Monday after the government announced steps to open stock and bond markets wider to foreigners. After the stock market closed , the government announced it would raise the foreign stock holding ceiling to 23 percent of a listed firm from the current 20 percent , effective from May 1. The government would also allow domestic financial institutions to raise funds in Asia and Europe for investment in the local bond market this year. President Kim Young-sam , adding his weight to the liberalisation announcements , ordered his economic ministers to hasten access for foreign investors to the domestic capital market. _ The government should actively pursue measures to stabilise the foreign exchange market which faces difficulties due_to the expansion of a current account deficit , _ Kim told economic ministers. The government estimated the measures would attract an additional $8 billion this year , bringing foreign capital infow to $28 billion , instead_of an earlier estimated $20 billion. But economists warned the government was too optimistic. _ I doubt if foreign funds will really flow in as much as the government estimates , _ said an economist at the Korea Institute of Finance , who declined to be identified. But economists and dealers said they did not believe Monday's announcements would have a fundamental impact on the won. _ The moves will not reverse the dollar's bullishness , _ said a Hana Bank dealer. _ Why should the won strengthen , when the dollar continues to rise in world markets ? _ The yield on three-year benchmark corporate bonds closed at 12.50 percent , down from 12.66 percent on Saturday.
