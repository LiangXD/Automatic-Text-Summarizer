This information was disclosed by a NASA representative at the Russian Mission Control. According to NASA experts, the primary objective of the shuttle's mission is to deliver to the International Space Station (ISS) the 4th long-term expedition led by Russian cosmonaut Yuri Onufriyenko. This crew will replace the 3rd long-term expedition (American astronaut Frank Culbertson and two Russian cosmonauts - Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin,) which has been aboard the ISS since August 13. NASA representatives also said that the satellite will be surveyed and used by several American universities.
