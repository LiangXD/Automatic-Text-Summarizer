HONG KONG, Nov 21 (AFP) -- The number of south Asians seeking political asylum in Hong Kong is on the rise following the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, it was reported Wednesday. Some 200 South Asians, most claiming to be businessmen, had sought political asylum from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Hong Kong between August and October, double the total number applying over the past seven years, the mass-circulating Chinese paper Oriental Daily News said. A spokesman for the security bureau said Hong Kong would not grant anyone political asylum under present policies.
