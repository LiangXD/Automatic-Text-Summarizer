A group of investors led by Giant Group Ltd. and its chairman, Burt Sugarman, said it filed with federal antitrust regulators for clearance to buy more than 50% of the stock of Rally's Inc., a fast-food company based in Louisville, Ky. Giant Group owned 22% of Rally's shares before the initial public offering. A second group of three company directors, aligned with Rally's founder James Patterson, also is seeking control of the fast-food chain.
