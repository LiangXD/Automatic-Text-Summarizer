Venezuela's new dawn BBC correspondent in Caracas Venezuelans awoke on Friday to a country transformed by the dramatic and violent events of the last 24 hours, which left at least 11 people dead and more than 80 injured. The country was no longer the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in honour of South American independence hero Simon Bolivar, one of former president Hugo Chavez's heroes. Shellshocked Managers were striking because Mr Chavez had filled the company's board of directors with his supporters. As marchers called for Mr Chavez's resignation outside Miraflores, the presidential palace, shots were fired into the crowd. Film footage also caught armed supporters of Mr Chavez firing indiscriminately at the marchers. Chavez's last day At the time, Mr Chavez was addressing the nation to assure them his government respected people's right to demonstrate and freedom of the press. As tanks surrounded Miraflores, Mr Chavez was holed up with senior military officers in a bid to save his presidency. In the early hours of the morning, chief of the armed forces General Lucas Rincon held a brief news conference to say Mr Chavez's resignation had been demanded and accepted. Mr Chavez is currently detained at Fuerte Tiuna army base in Caracas and could face possible charges for his role in the killings. News of Mr Chavez's resignation caused hundreds of flag-waving and whistle-blowing Venezuelans to surround the city's air force base, La Carlota, in the hope of seeing Mr Chavez' departure from the country.
