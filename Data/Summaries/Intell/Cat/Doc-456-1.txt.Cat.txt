Speaking on behalf of the NGOs , human rights organisation, Hakam president Ramdas Tikamdas said the boycott was to protest the government's poor response to Suhakam's numerous recommendations thus far. The NGOs note with deep concern that the government has largely ignored Suhakam's maiden report and its freedom of assembly report. The NGOs stressed the government has also failed to respect or recognise Suhakam's recommendations and also lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia. The NGOs also noted that the government has yet to show its commitment and respect for universal human rights principles by ratifying the international instruments of human rights, namely the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Covenant Against Torture. On the other hand, the NGOs said there is nothing in the public records which shows that Abu Talib was committed to protecting civil liberties and advancing human rights. We will also note to what extent Suhakam will monitor the government's compliance with previous recommendations on various human rights issues contained in its maiden report to the Parliament as well as its other reports, he added. Ramdas said Suhakam's performance will be judged not on the number of statements issued or reports produced but on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia. When the bill (Suhakam Act ) was tabled in the parliament, our Foreign Affairs Minister (Syed Hamid Albar) promised that this would be a positive development in protecting and promoting human rights in Malaysia. Instead of resorting to such measures, the commissioner said the NGOs should work with Suhakam for the advancement of human rights in this country. He added the boycott could create the impression that the NGOs were acting out of self interest and are not honest about championing human rights.
