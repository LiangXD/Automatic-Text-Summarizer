The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill's Career Academy staff for job search assistance. Jerry's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately. It took some time and hard work, but with the help of Goodwill, Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor's office, find housing and conduct a more thorough job search. Of the more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999, over 5,000 of them have multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job. But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to overcome, like Jerry. With a promising new job at a plastic injection molding manufacturer, his legal troubles in check and a safe place to live, Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself and contributing to his community. Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful employment.
