TAIPEI, Sept 27 (AFP) -- Taiwan is expected to officially become a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in March 2002, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Chen said Thursday. March appears to be a more reasonable estimate while earlier admission cannot be entirely ruled out, according to Chen, also Taiwan's chief WTO negotiator. Chen said Taiwan is set to reduce the average tariff rate on 1,021 farm products to 12.9 percent after its WTO accession from 20.0 percent currently. Under a quota system, the tariffs on imported cars would be reduced from 30.0 percent in the first year after Taiwan's WTO entry to 17.5 percent in 10 years, he said.
