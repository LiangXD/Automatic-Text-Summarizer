CROATIA : Serbs throw bricks at Croatian HDZ party delegates. Serbs throw bricks at Croatian HDZ party delegates. Laura Lui ZAGREB 1997-03-31 Hundreds of angry Serbs attacked delegates from Croatia's ruling HDZ party who had to be rescued by U.N. peacekeepers while trying to campaign for upcoming elections in Eastern Slavonia on Monday. U.N. spokesman Douglas Coffman said the Croatian Democratic party ( HDZ ) held a press conference in a hotel in the town of Vukovar to present candidates who will run in the Serb enclave during nation-wide local elections on April 13. Eastern Slavonia was one of three regions of Croatia in which local Serbs rebelled against Zagreb's drive for independence from federal Yugoslavia in 1991 and set up their own state. Western officials are concerned that many Serbs , fearing reprisals or refusing to live under Croatian rule , may leave Eastern Slavonia before Zagreb's control is restored.
