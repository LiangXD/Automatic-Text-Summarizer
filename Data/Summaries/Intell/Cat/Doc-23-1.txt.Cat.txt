CRICKET-INDIA SET FOR VICTORY AFTER WEST INDIES CRASH.BRIDGETOWN , Barbados 1997-03-30 India were poised to claim only their third win in 31 tests in the Caribbean after their seam bowlers routed the West Indies batsmen during the third day of the third test on Sunday. The West Indies were bowled out for a meagre 140 in their second innings , their lowest score ever against India , to leave the tourists needing 120 to win in their second innings with two full days left. The West Indies' total , eleven runs short_of the 151 they managed at Madras during the 1978-79 series , would have been even lower but_for a last wicket stand of 33 runs between fast bowlers Mervyn Dillon ( 21 ) and Curtly Ambrose ( 18 not out ). Earlier in the day the West Indies had done well in reducing India from 249 for three overnight to 319 all out , capturing the last four wickets for 29 runs and restricting India's first innings lead to 21 runs. India lost the wickets of Saurav Ganguly ( 22 ) , Rahul Dravid ( 78 ) and Nayan Mongia ( one ) in the first session for the addition of only 41 runs as the West Indies bowlers dominated. After the break , the wickets of Sherwin Campbell ( 18 ) , Carl Hooper ( 4 ) , Lara , Courtney Browne ( 1 ) , Roland Holder ( 13 ) and Bishop ( 6 ) tumbled in quick succession as the West Indies collapsed to 95 for eight.
