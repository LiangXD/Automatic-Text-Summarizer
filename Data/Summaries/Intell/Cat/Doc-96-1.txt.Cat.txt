John P. Hughes NEW YORK 1996-04-01 Nervous bond market participants on Tuesday morning await the release of the first of two critical reports on the U.S. economy for this week. Such a reading would confirm that the manufacturing sector of the economy remained robust and heighten fears of continued strong U.S. economic growth. Market reaction to NAPM may be somewhat tempered by the more-watched nonfarm payrolls report looming on Friday. That may add to fear the Fed will vote to tighten again at its May 20 meeting should the figure come in strong. _ The Chicago ( purchasing managers report ) make us think we may see a 54 reading overall , but the interesting thing may be the supplier/deliveries ( component ) , _ said James Glassman , senior economist at Chase Securities Inc. With strong demand and low inventories it would be logical to expect a rebound in the manufacturing sector , Glassman said. Given that , the market likely would able to withstand a strong NAPM report , he said. Glassman said the market also may remain stable due_to the lrage amount of news to be digested between now and the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ). _ The market knows this ( manufacturing ) rebound is strong. Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting , on average , 182,000 new nonfarm jobs were created in March , compared to 339,000 in February. _ I would guess the market has already priced in a small increase in NAPM. We_ 're looking for a 54 , _ said John Ryding , senior economist at Bear Stearns & Co. Ryding said the market also had probably priced in at_least two more tightening moves over the next four to five months by the Fed.
