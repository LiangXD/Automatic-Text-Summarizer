The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has been strongly criticized and condemned by many countries. Many countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America have rejected the content of the US Human Rights Report, calling it a brazen distortion of the situation, a wrongful and illegitimate move, and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Recently, the Information Office of the Chinese People's Congress released a report on human rights in the United States in 2001, criticizing violations of human rights there. The United States has been preparing annual reports on human rights in 190 countries for 25 years while ignoring the real situation at home. However, such a criticism is absent in the 2001 human rights report as the United States is planning to try the al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees in military courts while refusing to grant them POW status. In light of the United States' malicious goals, its Annual Human Rights Report for 2001 is facing strong protest and criticism from the world. The Annual Human Rights Report released by the US State Department is not convincing as it is inaccurate and fabricated.
