Joyous South African enjoying view on space station CAPE CANAVERAL - (AP) -- A South African space tourist received a warm welcome aboard the international space station on Saturday and settled in for an eight-day, seven-night stay that cost him $20 million. Internet entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth is only the second person to pay his own way into space, and by the look of it, he considers the money well spent. The 28-year-old smiled broadly as he floated into the space station and was embraced by its three occupants. "The whole continent is proud that, at last, we have one of our own people from Africa up in space," said Mbeki, taking part in celebrations for Freedom Day, marking the 1994 elections that ended Apartheid. Shuttleworth's parents were relieved to see their adventure-seeking son, an entrepreneur who made his fortune off the Internet, safely aboard space station Alpha. They watched from Russian Mission Control outside Moscow as the Soyuz capsule smoothly docked with the space station 250 miles up. NASA opposed Tito's trip, saying he would interfere with space station work and possibly even endanger the crew. To avoid further conflict, NASA and the space agencies of Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan established criteria for future space station visitors. Shuttleworth met all the guidelines and went through eight months of cosmonaut training in Russia and one week of instruction at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Because of his U.S. training, Shuttleworth will have more leeway aboard the space station than Tito did. Shuttleworth, who is among the world's younger space travelers, joined his country's president on Saturday in calling for "a need for Africans to embrace the future and the importance of education, and especially science and mathematics."
