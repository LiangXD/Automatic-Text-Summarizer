Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 Lower imports shrank the U.S. trade deficit dramatically in June , the Commerce Department said Tuesday , bolstering the impression of gradual waning in the economy's vigour. The monthly gap between exports and imports plunged 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion from a revised $10.55 billion in May as fewer new foreign-made cars and computers poured into American markets. While imports of relatively cheap consumer goods from China kept rising , exports to the Asian trade giant fell for a fourth straight month during June to the lowest level since the beginning of 1995 , creating a deficit that Kantor called _ too high. _ Analysts were surprised by the sharp 3.3 percent falloff in overall June imports to $77.82 billion , while exports held up relatively well , falling just 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion. _ It says that exports are providing some underpinning for the U.S. economy but overall it tells us that we have sharply weakened in terms of economic vigour and activity , _ said Roger Shields , head of country risk management for Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. Lower imports of new cars and parts , especially from Japan and Germany , as_well_as cheaper petroleum helped shrink the merchandise trade gap. Lawrence Chimerine , executive director of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington , said trade benefited in June as the U.S. economic expansion lost some steam and dampened consumers' ardor for imports. But he warned that it will be hard to keep exports growing. _ The economy is slowing , _ Chimerine said. _ June marked the start of that process and the weak imports were part of it. _ But Europe is bouncing back only slowly , Japan is still wavering and Canada is weak _ as a source of demand for American goods , Chimerine said. _ I do_ n't think we_ 're going to see a_lot_of progress on lowering the trade deficit for the rest of this year. _ For the first six months of 1996 , the cumulative goods and services deficit was down 14 percent to $52.62 billion from $61.34 billion in the first half of 1995. In bilateral trade , the deficit with Western Europe fell 7.1 percent to $761 million and the shortfall with Canada was down 2.2 percent to $2.42 billion. The deficit with oil-producing OPEC countries dropped 26.9 percent in June to $1.40 billion from $1.91 billion in May.
