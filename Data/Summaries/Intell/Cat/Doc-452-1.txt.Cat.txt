December 1998 Your contribution to Goodwill will mean more than you may know. To help you see how much your contribution means, I'm sharing with you The words of people who have lived Goodwill's mission. Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that comes with work. When I first came to Goodwill I was a single parent with little or no self-esteem. I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow. My instructor played a role like no other instructor I've ever had I appreciate everything that Goodwill has done for me. -- Cornell Each year, we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles. A robust economy helps by providing job opportunities, but to be honest, most of the people who aren't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest obstacles. The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like health care, transportation and child care -problems that are big enough on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental disabilities, illiteracy and lack of job skills. Last year, Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their self-sufficiency. Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support services that will help even more find jobs. Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs. Use the enclosed card and give a generous gift to Goodwill today!
