It's not another ice age, but at least it's cooler As countries gear up for battles over ratifying the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a recent study suggests that the world already has stepped along the path to a future cooler than it might have been. Researchers at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York report that declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. The researchers link the slower rate to implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, in which countries agreed to phase out production of gases that erode the Earth's protective ozone layer. If the rate of increase in greenhouse gases had been maintained at the peak reached in 1980, the climate by 2050 would have reached temperatures not currently anticipated until 2100, when CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere are expected to have doubled, the researchers calculate. The slowdown also is due in part to the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide, for reasons that aren't well understood and need more study, notes James Hansen, the NASA researcher who conducted the study with Makiko Sato, also with the GISS.
