Some lousy earnings reports whacked the stock market, but bond prices fell only slightly and the dollar rose a little against most major currencies. Compaq Computer nose-dived $8.625 a share, to $100, and pulled other technology issues lower after reporting lower-than-expected earnings after the stock market closed Wednesday. The less-than-robust third-quarter results came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading. The number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that fell in price yesterday exceeded 1,000, a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical analysts. While bond investors would have preferred growth to be a little slower, they were cheered by inflation measures in the data that showed prices rising at a modest annual rate of 2.9%. In major market activity: Stock prices fell sharply in active trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 175.2 million shares. In late New York trading the dollar was at 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen compared with 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen Wednesday.
