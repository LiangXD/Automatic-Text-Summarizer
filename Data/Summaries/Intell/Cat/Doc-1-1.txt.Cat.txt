Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 The U.S. trade gap narrowed dramatically in June as imports of merchandise and petroleum plunged from May levels , the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. The monthly deficit dropped 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion from a revised $10.55 billion in May $-- much lower than the $9.4 billion shortfall that Wall Street economists had forecast for June. June exports eased a slight 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion while imports dropped 3.3 percent to $77.82 billion. The deficit with China climbed 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion in June , surpassing the $3.24 billion deficit with Japan that was up 3.6 percent from May. Steady improvement in shrinking the deficit with Japan was the main reason that China became the leading deficit nation in June , Commerce officials said. The deficit with oil-producing OPEC countries dropped 26.9 percent in June to $1.40 billion from $1.91 billion in May.
