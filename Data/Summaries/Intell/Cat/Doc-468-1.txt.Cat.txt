The Zionist and US administrations have the illusion that they succeeded in defeating the Palestinian people and their valiant intifadah. It is also true that thousands of Palestinians and their leaders are held hostage, and that the entire Palestinian people are now experiencing the utmost suffering as part of their daily lives. All this is one thing, but the Palestinian people's will is something different. The Zionists have succeeded in achieving these things, but a deep-rooted fact is that they have not succeeded, and will never succeed, in breaking the will of this valiant people or in forcing the Palestinians into relinquishing their just, legitimate rights and ending their glorious struggle for these rights. The real victor in this battle is, in fact, the Palestinian people and not the Zionists. As for the towns and refugee camps that have been destroyed, they will soon be reconstructed by the Palestinian people who have skillfully adapted themselves to the most difficult circumstances. Another deep-rooted fact is that the organizations of the Palestinian resistance still preserve their organizational structure and are also characterized by their superb ability to renew their leaders and replace the ones who fall along the path of martyrdom. The conclusion to which we come is that the Zionist and US administrations have aggravated the Zionist entity's historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that force can break the Palestinian people's will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose.
