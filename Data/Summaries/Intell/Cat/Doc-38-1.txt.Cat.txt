Stephen Young on the animals that excel in fuel economy Camels do it better. The camel is without_doubt one of the natural world '_ s most remarkable forms of transport. Underpinning all these accomplishments is the camel '_ s efficient use of metabolic fuel ? a skill put to good use by Mohammed '_ s camel , which allegedly covered the distance between Mecca and Jerusalem in four bounds. K. Yousef of the University of Nevada gathered recently in Australia to investigate the camel '_ s fuel economy. This figure is directly related to the rate of consumption of metabolic fuel ? the camel '_ s equivalent of mpg. Over the same distance , people use two and a half times more energy ( per kilogram of their bulk ) than the average camel. Although large animals are generally more efficient at walking than small ones ? just as trains outperform cars ? the camel is in an altogether different league. The camel '_ s metabolic response to heavy loads is no less dramatic. Most animals increase their fuel consumption in proportion to the extra baggage they are carrying , but not the camel. With a burden of about 150 kilograms ? equal to more than a quarter of its body weight ? a camel burns only around 15 per_cent more fuel than it burns unladen. The findings throw fresh light on the camel '_ s former popularity both as pack animal and military mount. As the Christmas story demonstrates , more peace-loving potentates also appreciate the camel '_ s skills. Zoologists have yet to establish the precise mechanisms behind the camel '_ s fuel economy.
