On a more dangerous level, it may provide fodder to Taiwan's military forces and play into the hands of Taiwan separatist extremists. On March 22, Admiral Dennis Blair, commander-in-chief of the US Pacific Command, told the House Armed Services Committee that the United States and Taiwan can maintain a military balance across the Taiwan Straits if both sides continue modernizing their armed forces. It seems that this so-called military balance is what Taiwan leader Chen Shui-bian wants. Last Wednesday when receiving a special delegation from the US House of Representatives, Chen said that the strong support of the US Congress - which led to US arms sales to Taiwan in April last year - ensured a balanced cross-Straits military situation and peace in the Taiwan Straits. Helping Taiwan build its military muscle will only foment pro-independence forces. Since the latest remarks and events may give these forces the impression that the United States is on their side and ready to provide military protection, they may become provocative enough to push the island to the edge.
