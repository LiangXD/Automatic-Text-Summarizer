The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez Washington Times April 25, 2002 Pg. 18 The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez In Venezuela, the dust is finally settling after the dramatic turbulence of the past two weeks. President Hugo Chavez is once again at the helm of power, and the military has returned to its barracks. Their loved ones were gunned down, first by sympathizers of Mr. Chavez and subsequently by supporters of the short-lived interim government. Mr. Chavez was ousted in a military coup on April 12 after 17 persons were killed during an anti-Chavez protest, apparently by sharpshooters faithful to the president. So far, Mr. Chavez appears complicit in the initial wave of killings. Mr. Cardoso's concerns are quite valid, but he has downplayed some of Mr. Chavez's more alarming faults. Interestingly, Mr. Chavez initially rose to power in the 1990s because of the discontent with former President Carlos Andres Perez, who had ordered the military to shoot at crowds in 1989.
