SOCCER-BOTAFOGO BEAT THE RULES TO REACH FINAL. Brian Homewood RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-03-30 Botafogo won the first stage of the Rio de Janeiro championship on Sunday after a match in which the bizarre rules of the competition , rather_than rivals Vasco da Gama , appeared to be their real opponents. Botafogo won all eleven of their games in the first stage of the tournament but were then forced to decide the title in a Sunday's one-off match against Vasco , who finished the stage eight points below them in second place. The rules stated that in the first stage , the top two teams would meet in a final , no_matter_how far apart they were. Goalkeeper Vagner commented : _ After eleven straight wins , we still had to play Vasco but I think God was watching us. _ Winning the first stage guarantees Botafogo a place in the final of the tournament , where they will join the winners of the next two stages. Curiously , the next two stages will be decided on points , with no final being played. The top two teams in each group qualify for the final stage.
