Steven Scheer NEW YORK 1997-03-31 With the increasing likelihood the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again by early July , U.S. Treasury market participants said that the bill sector should benefit from rising coupon yields and a big drop in stock prices. Bills $-- primarily three $- and six-month $-- have outperformed the rest of the yield curve since last Tuesday's quarter-point rate hike by the Fed. Players said the sector is highly expensive , but between quarter-end pressures and the Fed seemingly embarking on a tightening cycle , it is logical for bills to do well. _ This is a preservation-of-capital period , _ said Craig Coats , co-head of taxable fixed income at Prudential Securities Inc , noting players will continue to park money in safe-haven areas such as bills and repos for the time being. _ People will stay short until the Fed is at the end of its ( tightening ) program , _ he said. _ They_ 'll buy the short end to be defensive. _ Helping drive rates down , traders said , is the smaller pool of bills offered. Mahoney said that weaker stock prices aside , there are enough reasons the front end should do well in the near term. _ The front end holds more value , _ he said. _ So , we should see the front end outperform the back end for the next month. _ As such , Mahoney forecasts a steepening of the overall yield curve , perhaps as much as 10 basis points. Traders noted that the near term directon of the curve and whether bills can hold at what is perceived to be 10 basis points too expensive lies with Friday's March employment report. _ If we get a weaker jobs report and people say the Fed will ( skip ) the next tightening ( in May ) , we may see bills start to loosen up , _ said a trader at a Japanese-based dealer.
