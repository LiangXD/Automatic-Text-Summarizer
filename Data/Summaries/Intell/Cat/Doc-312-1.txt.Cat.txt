Shuttle Atlantis thunders toward space station CAPE CANAVERAL - Seven astronauts and a truckload of hardware are racing toward the International Space Station following the successful blastoff Monday of the space shuttle Atlantis. The launch was the first of six scheduled for the next seven months in a flurry of activity designed to get the space station closer to completion. Mission specialist Jerry L. Ross, a grandfather, became the first astronaut to make seven space flights.
