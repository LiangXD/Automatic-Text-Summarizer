As you begin that process this year, I would like to ask you to consider helping young people in Marion County toward more positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the Marion County Commission on Youth, Inc. In addition to that behind-the-scenes role, MCCOY has taken an out-front role in developing a Summer Bus Pass, neighborhood youth councils, and the We Value Youth information line. I have enclosed a packet of information about MCCOY and its work as well as an application with various options for supporting the youth of our community. Please consider joining together with your fellow citizens in support of the work of the Marion County Commission on Youth.
