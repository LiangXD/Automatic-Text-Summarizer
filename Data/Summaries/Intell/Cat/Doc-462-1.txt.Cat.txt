INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC Talks between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) about a free trade area went smoothly, senior officials said yesterday. We are confident the framework will be ready for Chinese and ASEAN leaders to finalize at their November summit, said a senior official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC). The third China-ASEAN Economic Senior Official's meeting, held in Beijing on Tuesday, set up a trade negotiation committee to hold in-depth discussions on the framework of a free trade area in the region. Chinese and ASEAN officials said the decision by Chinese and ASEAN leaders to establish a free trade area is a historic milestone in economic co-operation between China and ASEAN and demonstrates strong commitments by China-ASEAN leaders to regional integration and economic globalization as they pursue peace and stability and prosperity in the region.
