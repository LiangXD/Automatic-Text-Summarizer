Even More Proving Rape Chatterbox feels that the Wall Street Journal editorial page's coverage of Juanita Broaddrick's rape charges against Bill Clinton (see Proving Rape , More Proving Rape, as well as Michael Kinsley's Readme column in the current issue) cries out for the introduction of the Scientific Method into the usually mushy business of assessing press responsibility. (A responsible account of the whole controversy in today's New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon had nothing to do with her corroboration.) 19. Because it has published three times since the initial omission, it scores an additional three points. Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus points for having eventually convinced Broaddrick to grant an interview to the New York Times (as the Times reports in today's story). And besides, Rabinowitz's efforts on the Times ' behalf weren't really unethical, just puzzling, given the two newspapers' intense rivalry. When Chatterbox asked the Journal 's DC bureau chief, Alan Murray, who exercised good judgment in not breaking the Broaddrick story (and--full disclosure-- is Chatterbox's former boss), to comment about a Journal employee's feeding sources to the Times , he replied: I don't really have any comment on what the edit page did. For her part, Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf of the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them sound. Ms. Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared at the house in the a.m., and that she had refused an interview, Rabinowitz writes in an e-mail message. I asked her why she had decided to talk to the New York Post 's Steve Dunleavy, and refused a Times reporter. She asked if I thought it would be all right to talk to the Times reporter. So--that's how it happens that in the New York Times piece today I'm described--solemnly--as having 'eventually convinced' her to repeat the story to the New York Times. --Timothy Noah
