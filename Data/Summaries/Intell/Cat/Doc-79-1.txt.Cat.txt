NEW YORK 1997-03-31 U.S. crude oil prices are likely to remain entrenched in a weak range this week amid ample physical supplies , but analysts say the upcoming _ driving season _ could begin to mop up some of the excess. Analysts are keeping watch on today's expiry of the April contracts for refined products , especially for gasoline , to set the tone for the oil complex this week. _ Much hinges on how gasoline progresses , _ said John Saucer , an analyst with Smith Barney in Houston. _ At this point , it_ 's still struggling relative to the rest of the complex. _ Tom Bentz of ING Derivatives in New York seconded that view. _ Gasoline still has_ n't exhibited a_lot_of strength. NYMEX gasoline for April was trading around 64.30 cents a gallon in New York Harbor early Monday afternoon , down 0.33 cents from Thursday's settlement. U.S. sour cash crudes were steady although traders expect these grades to lose steam in the weeks ahead. _ If there_ 's one thing we_ 've got plenty_of it_ 's sour , _ said a Texas broker. _ I still think we could be below below $3.00 ( discount to WTI/Cushing ). _ West Texas Sour/Midland was trading around WTI/Cushing minus $2.40 a barrel late Monday morning. Nigerian crude as_well_as short-haul barrels from Latin America are also plentiful , giving Gulf Coast refiners a wide range of crudes to choose from as they gear up_to produce more gasoline. One trader pointed out , however , that improved refining margins are transforming the current crude surplus into a product surplus , a concept that could be borne out in this week's inventory statistics. $-- New York Energy Desk ( ( +1_212_859 1620 ) )
