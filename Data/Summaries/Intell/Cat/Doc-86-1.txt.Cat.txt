The education program was designed to teach students about Earhart and to spur interest in science , math and geography. _ What Amelia did is to try and set a new world record , _ Finch said. _ But what we_ 're doing is to communicate a message , that you do not have to live within defined limits that society sets or that many people set for themselves. _ Some children in the crowd , many of whose parents had not been born when Earhart died , seemed well-informed about Earhart's journey , calling her a _ hero _ and an _ inspiration. _ But Matt Bodenhamer , 8 , of Miami , expressed doubts about Finch's re-creation. _ I think it_ 's crazy.
