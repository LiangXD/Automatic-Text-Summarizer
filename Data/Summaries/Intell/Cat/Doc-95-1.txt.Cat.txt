USA : Wall St stocks slide for second straight session. Wall St stocks slide for second straight session. Richard Melville NEW YORK 1997-03-31 Heightened concern about the outlook for interest rates sent Wall Street stocks skidding for a second straight session on Monday and dragged the Dow industrials to one of their sharpest losses ever. The slide , unofficially the sixth largest in history in point terms , came on the heels of a 140-point skid on Thursday. _ There_ 's clearly nervousness out_there right_now , _ said Philip Orlando , chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. _ We_ 've got industries like technology that have just gotten hammered , with many companies losing half their value in just the last two months , _ he added. The declines by technology issues , coupled with weak showing by health-care stocks , pulled Nasdaq down 28 points to 1222. Analysts said some of the activity bore the earmarks of portfolio window-dressing by managers leery of showing large stock holdings in the uncertain climate. _ Today was the last day of the quarter , and it looked like we got some reverse window-dressing , _ said Peter Canelo , chief investment strategist at Dean Witter. _ All of a sudden nobody wants to show they own any stocks , _ he said. Yields on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury edged up_to 7.10 percent ahead_of the NAPM report , extending an upward creep that has become a burden for stocks and has some questioning whether rates will level off anytime soon. _ If ( the bond yield ) was a stock , we would buy it , _ said Gary Kaltbaum , technical analyst at J.W. Charles Securities. _ We_ 're getting to levels on the yield that are_ n't even on the one-year chart. _ Financial stocks were pummelled amid the broad decline , including Dow components J.P. Morgan & Co Inc , off 4-1/2 to 98-1/4 , and Travelers Group Inc , down 2-7/8 to 48. Analysts said brokerages were particularly hard hit among financials , another symptom of ailing market sentiment. _ The brokerage index is extremely sensitive to market climates , _ said Joseph Barthel , chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co. He added that traditionally , brokerage stocks peak about six months before the onset of a bear market , but warned that trying to time such a peak is an act of futility. _ You never know when the peak was until you look back , _ he said.
