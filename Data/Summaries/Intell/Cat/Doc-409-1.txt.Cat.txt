Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job. For 18 long months Michael could not find a job. At Goodwill, Michael's counselors felt that his personable demeanor could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match where his people skills could shine. After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person for the job. With support from people like you, they can overcome their barriers and earn success and the self-sufficiency that comes with it. Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public support and more paying taxes. Last year, participants in Goodwill programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $3.5 million. Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three-quarters of a million dollars in public assistance. Your gift will help give new meaning to the word success -- for people who have seldom had reason to use the word. For every dollar of public support Goodwill received last year, we returned $1.59 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments.
