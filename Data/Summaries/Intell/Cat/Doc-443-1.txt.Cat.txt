You help Jameson campers reach for them. Jameson points the way for children who need that extra hand and I hope you'll continue your support this year. What has your support of our campers meant to them and what have they been able to accomplish because you care? In just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids and a few extra activities to a team of almost 60 young adults taking on real projects. YL teens will make J.C. juniors happen again this year for 7 and 8 year old campers. A five day camp, J.C. juniors introduces at-risk children to Jameson two years earlier than we could previously reach them. The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them. If you can increase your last donation, we would appreciate that show of support for the campers and their efforts to overcome obstacles and create successful lives.
