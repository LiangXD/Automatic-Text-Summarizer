Environmentalist groups staged a protest against the U.S. alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on Sunday prior to President George W. Bush's arrival in the capital. Protesters carried banners reading, Ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol. Bush sparked international outcry when he rejected the Kyoto Protocol last March, saying it would mean sacrificing U.S. economic growth. We demand of you, Mr. President, to reconsider your climate policy plan immediately and re-enter the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol is the only existing international framework to prevent dangerous climate change, it added. Kiko Network also sent an e-mail message to Koizumi urging the premier to call on Bush to return to the Kyoto Protocol at an early stage and to inform him of Japan's plan to ratify the Kyoto Protocol after the Diet approves ratification during the current Diet session.
