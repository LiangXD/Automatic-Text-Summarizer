Mugabe wins poll, amid claims of rigging HARARE, March 13 (AFP) - Zimbabwe's long-time ruler Robert Mugabe swept to victory Wednesday in Presidential elections in a vote that challenger Morgan Tsvangirai declared was rigged and unacceptable. Registrar General Tobaiwa Mudede announced on state television that Mugabe was re-elected with 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,758 votes for Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Tsvangirai rejected Mugabe's election victory out of hand. British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw cited 'pretty strong' evidence that Mugabe has 'stolen' Zimbabwe's vote, an outcome he said would have 'enormous implications for the nature of our relationship with Zimbabwe.' The MDC, charging that the Mugabe government had followed a deliberate strategy of impeding the urban vote, went to the High Court and won an extra day of voting on Monday, but polls opened several hours late, and only an additional 24,000 votes were cast. The election is the hardest fought battle for Zimbabwe's top post since liberation war hero Mugabe took over after independence from Britain in 1980. Turnout across the southern African country was an estimated 66 per cent in an election fraught by violence, intimidation and intense legal wrangling over civic rights and electoral rules. Even after the polls closed Monday, Mugabe's government kept up the pressure on the opposition by charging MDC Secretary General Welshman Ncube with high treason, which the party dismissed as a smear tactic. The influential International Crisis Group (ICG) warned that the 'risk of major violence erupting is exceedingly high' if the election was seen to be rigged.
