Russia disagrees with 'axis' remark MUNICH, Germany -- Russia's defense minister said Sunday that his country disagrees with the U.S. view of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil." 11. Foreign Minister Sergei Ivanov told a global conference of government and military leaders that he sees no evidence that any of the three nations supports terrorism and insisted that any move against them must follow international law. President Bush described Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil" during his State of the Union address on Jan. China's official Xinhua news agency also weighed in Sunday on Bush's choice of words, accusing the president of orchestrating public opinion in advance of possible strikes against the three countries in an expansion of the war against terrorism. Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino, meanwhile, said Sunday that his country would not support an attack on Iraq without "proven proof" that Baghdad is supporting al Qaeda, and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein dispatched a delegation to meet with European Union leaders in Spain. "Well, we don't like some of your allies like Saudi Arabia or Gulf states who give finance to terrorism organizations," Ivanov said. A diverse U.S delegation delivered a singular message to conference participants: NATO remains vital and the United States needs a range of allies in the fight against terrorism and intends to consult its friends.
