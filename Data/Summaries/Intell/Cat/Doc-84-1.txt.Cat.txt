NEW YORK 1997-03-31 While shares of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp took a beating Monday following a federal probe and media reports about its billing practices , industry analysts continued to support the stock. Columbia/HCA lost 4-3/4 to 33 and was the heavily traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange. Investor concerns also have been fueled by a recent New York Times report concerning the Nashville , Tenn.-based company's Medicare coding practices and physician ownership in certain of its hospitals. Analysts cautioned that the New York Times used its own methodology , which has not been verified by others in the healthcare industry , as the basis of its article. Columbia/HCA said it was not given the opportunity to review the New York Times' data and could not address the newspaper's findings. Analysts expect Columbia/HCA's stock to continue to face near-term pressure but said the company will remain a market leader over the long-term. _ The stock was in for a tough day today. The stock will rebound , but I expect continued negative commentary to pressure the stock for the near-term , _ John Hindelong , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette. _ We still think Columbia is a giant $-- a market leader that is incredibly successful.
