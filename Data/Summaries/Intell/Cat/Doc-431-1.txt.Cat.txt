Ohio Congressman Arrives in Jordan AMMAN, Jordan (AP) U.S. Representative Tony Hall arrived in Jordan on Saturday en route to Iraq, where he is expected to look into the plight of Iraqis after nearly 10 years of U.N. trade sanctions. During his four days in Iraq, Hall said he wanted to investigate reports from relief agencies that a quarter of Iraqi children may be suffering from chronic malnutrition. If supplies are not reaching the people who need them, Hall said, he wanted to find out whether the United Nations or relief agencies needed to handle things differently, or whether Iraq needs to get out of the way and let us do the job.
