Regular British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, Robin Cook signalled tonight. His remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar after Northern Alliance troops finally entered Kunduz. But Commons Leader Mr Cook said: If you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put British troops into the ground civil war and I don't myself imagine that's going to change. British troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was better than anybody could have hoped for , according to Mr Cook. News of the Kandahar negotiations came after the Taliban control crumbled in their final northern stronghold of Kunduz following mass surrender. The city's top Taliban commander was among thousands of Afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting. The surrender took days to hammer out, primarily because hard core Taliban and foreign troops from Usama Bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida terror network did not want to give up. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold following the rapid collapse of their regime across the majority of the country. There are some talks and negotiations going on there (in Kandahar) with the Taliban to surrender themselves, Gen Mohammed Zaer Azimi said in Herat.
