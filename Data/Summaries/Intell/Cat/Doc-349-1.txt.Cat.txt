New man for a new NASA mission Forget space shuttles, orbiting telescopes, and more robotic rovers on Mars. The next mission for NASA could be to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program. President Bush has nominated Sean O'Keefe, deputy director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, to replace him. Where Mr. Goldin was a product of the US aerospace industry, Mr. O'Keefe has served as chief financial officer for the Pentagon, Navy secretary, and business-school professor. O'Keefe is not known as a space enthusiast, says Keith Cowing, a former NASA scientist and editor of NASAWatch.com. In the spring of 1992, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., had five spacecraft in space and three or four under development, he said last month. But the agency's credibility has come under fire in manned spaceflight - especially the International Space Station, now completing its first year of full-time crews. And this month, a task force on the project's budget concluded that NASA's cost estimate for finishing the core station between 2002 and 2008 is not credible. Now O'Keefe's is to fix the space station. O'Keefe's appointment is a clear message from the administration: NASA has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we'd like to see NASA do, says Patricia Dasch of the National Space Society.
