Teen Who Sold White iPhone Kits Reveals How Apple Hunted Him Down One of the last followers of tech news to hear the reports Thursday that Apple had sued Fei Lam, the 17-year-old Queens high school student who infamously sold White iPhone conversion kits to eager buyers tired of waiting on Apple's release, was Fei Lam. For someone who allegedly made contacts in China to import iPhone parts before Apple, started his own business (WhiteiPhone4Now.com), and pulled in tens of thousands of dollars in revenue--sometimes as much as $8,000 a day--it's easy to forget that Lam is just a teenage boy still living with his parents. And yesterday, it surfaced that Apple had sicced its legal pitbulls on the teen, filing a lawsuit against Lam over trademark infringement that would force him to cease from future sales and forfeit all profits from the venture.
