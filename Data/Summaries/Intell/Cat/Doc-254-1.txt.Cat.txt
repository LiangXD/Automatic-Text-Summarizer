Billions of investors' dollars are pouring out of the nation's junk-bond mutual funds, undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market. Last week alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc., a Boston research firm. In the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says. It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds. Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months. If the heavy outflows continue, fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead. Mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk, accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield, high-risk market. The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $32 billion. The $1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $150 million in the past two months. About 98% of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds, says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going into money market funds. The fund, with a cash cushion of more than 10%, has met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing, Mr. Litvack says. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors yanked out about $182 million in the past two months. 19, high-yield funds had an average 0.85% total return (the price change plus dividends on fund shares), according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Fidelity's junk fund has fallen 2.08% this year through Oct. Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues, such as RJR Nabisco, to raise cash to meet expected redemptions.
