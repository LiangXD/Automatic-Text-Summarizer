Body of missing ultra marathoner found in New Mexico wilderness Searchers on Saturday found the body of renowned long-distance runner Micah True, who vanished four days earlier after heading out from a lodge for a morning run in the rugged wilderness near New Mexico's Gila National Forest. The 58-year-old True, whose extreme-distance running prowess is detailed in the book Born to Run, set out on what -- for him -- would have been a routine 12-mile run Tuesday from The Wilderness Lodge and Hot Springs, where he was staying. Lodge co-owner Dean Bruemmer, who helped with the search Saturday, said he last saw his friend at breakfast. There are a lot of trailheads up the road, said Bruemmer, whose lodge is about four miles from the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument. True, who had been friends with Bruemmer and his wife, Jane, for 10 years, would often visit their lodge while traveling between Mexico and his Boulder, Colo., home. As a result, Bruemmer said, True certainly knew the trail system well -- which made his disappearance all the more mystifying to everyone. Michael Sandrock, a columnist who writes about running for The Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, knew True for at least 20 years and had run with him. He called True a pioneer of the sport of ultrarunning, which involves running extreme distances, often on grueling terrain and many miles longer than a traditional 26-mile marathon. True was the race director of The Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon, a 50-plus mile extreme race that took place in Urique, Mexico, on March 4.
