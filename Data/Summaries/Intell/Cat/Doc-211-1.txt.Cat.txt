As usual, the US State Department published its annual report on human rights practices in world countries last Monday. Its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government, human rights experts said at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR) on Friday. The United States was slandering China again, said Xirao-Nima, a professor of Tibetan history at the Central University for Nationalities. It has no right to issue such a false human rights report, experts said. The United Nations has held the high goal of protecting human rights, Jin said. It somewhat softens its tone in the China human rights report. But it nevertheless uses human rights issues to slander China, CSSHR President Zhou Jue said. Some Westerners who have been there have also seen the ever-improving human rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region, he added. The Italian senator's words are in sharp contrast to what was contained in the so-called China human rights report compiled by the United States, which blindly accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet. Throughout the report, there are many doubtful phrases, such as 'according to credible reports', 'various sources' and 'anecdotal evidence,' to name a few. To back up their reckless conclusion, the report lists many incidents where it said religious freedom was violated. The report said China should not have arrested Li, a Hong Kong businessman, who was charged with smuggling Bibles into the country in July. The US human rights report also accuses China of taking advantage of anti-terrorism campaigns to crackdown on ethnic group people living in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
