The Egyptian governmental newspaper Al-Ahram wrote that Bush used the same language in his State of the Union speech that Osama bin Laden used in his video messages. The editor of the Al-Quds newspaper published in London Abd Al-Bari Atvan went further and compared George Bush with Hitler. The editor wrote that Bush showed in his speech that he is craving for blood and is ready to declare war on half of the world in order to take revenge. The editor believes that Bush is willing to wage war against Iran and Iraq, because they have weapons of mass destruction, but Bush does not want to notice that Israel also has these kinds of weapons. Atvan said that Bush's speech looked like one of Hitler's. The editor of the Arabic newspaper believes that one should do everything possible to put an end to Bush's imprudence, otherwise the war that he is going to have will overshadow the World Wars.
