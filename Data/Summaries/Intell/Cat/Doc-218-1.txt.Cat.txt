As Israeli tanks push their way into one Palestinian population center after another it has become more and more difficult to guess what political objectives might be driving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. The categorical moral condemnation of terrorism is self-evident, but this will not free Israel from the problem it faces. Israeli's own 35-year-old occupation and resettlement policies have created the breeding ground for the terrorism that Sharon is now trying to root out by resorting exclusively to military means. Israel is responsible for about three million bitter people who lack political rights. Israel's resettlement policies have been justified on the grounds of security. Since Sharon refuses to offer the Palestinians their own state with acceptable borders and conditions, there are two alternatives left. Terrorism will not be absent from such a country and, in the process, Israel will lose the right to count itself among the world's democracies. Sharon, of course, will not admit that he is planning anything like this, even though the idea has been discussed in Israel. They are the simultaneous ending of the violence and the [Israeli] resettlement policy followed by negotiations on the basis of the recent Saudi Arabian proposal and the earlier results of the talks at Camp David and Taba. By supporting Sharon's irresponsible saber rattling, Washington places strains on its relations with the Arab countries and needlessly puts off a settlement, in which it must some day play the role of midwife.
