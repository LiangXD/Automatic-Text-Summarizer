STRASBOURG, Nov 29 (AFP) -- Three leading international organisations warned jointly Thursday [29 November] that the international fight against terrorism should not be a pretext for the violation of human rights. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, Walter Schwimmer, Secretary General of the Council of Europe and Ambassador Gerard Stoudmann of the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights said it was essential that states strictly adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism. Robinson, a particularly critical voice in guarding against human rights abuses in the wake of the September 11 attacks, said Wednesday the war on terrorism was taking a heavy toll on civil liberties.
