MOSCOW, October 22 (Itar-Tass) - Russia is actively holding consultations with the oil exporting countries, President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in the Kremlin on Monday. Relations with Venezuela are important for Russia, and twice as important considering the fact that at present Venezuela is the chairperson at OPEC, President Putin said. He said in this connection that Russia supported the keeping of oil prices within the just range. It is taking place at the time, when ever more OPEC members begin to support the idea that oil production should be reduced again, in order to stop the continuing decline of the prices of hydrocarbons on the world market. The purpose of the trip of Hugo Chavez is to find ways of effectively protecting the oil market and the world oil prices, as well as the interests of Venezuela as one of the world's biggest oil exporters.
