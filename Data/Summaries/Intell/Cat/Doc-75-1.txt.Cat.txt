NEW YORK 1997-03-31 WHX Corp said Monday it began a cash tender offer for $40 a common share of Dynamics Corp of America. WHX said its tender offer is currently for up_to 649,000 shares common shares. WHX said that if Dynamics amends its _ poison pill _ anti-takeover defense trigger to below 20 percent , then the percentage to be bought in its offer would be automatically reduced by a commensurate amount. WHX , a holding company whose principal unit is Wheeling , Pittsburgh Steel Corp , said that late last week it sent a letter to Dynamics proposing a cash merger at $40 a share , giving the merger deal a value of about $160 million. In its proposal , WHX said it was prepared to raise its offer if additional information that Dynamics may provide proves that a higher price was warranted. So that it may vote the shares it acquires in the tender offer at Dynamics' upcoming annual meeting , WHX said it will not be deemed to be duly tendered , and will not be accepted for purchase , unless they are tendered as_of the March 14 , record date for the annual meeting , or are accompanied by an irrevocable proxy from a holder as_of that date.
