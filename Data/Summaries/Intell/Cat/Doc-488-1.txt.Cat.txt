JAMMU, Apr 2 -- Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah today accused Pakistan army for breeding terrorism in India to remain in power against the wishes of their people who want peace. 'For their sustenance and survival, Pak generals have been throttling the voice of Pakistanis who wish to live in friendship and cordiality with their neighbours', the Chief Minister said while addressing a function organised by United Public High School at Channi Himat here this afternoon. The Chief Minister described Pakistan as mother of terrorism and said if the world has to rid itself from this menace, the perpetrators across the border had to be dealt with firmly. Reiterating that Pakistan will not give up terror, the Chief Minister said that ultimately the demon they have reared will eat up their own vitals. Responding to the demands put forth in a memorandum by the residents of Chhanni Himmat, Narwal, Malik Marker Bye-Pass, Chhanni Bija, Chhanni Rama, Chhanni Kamala and Ambedkar Nagar, the Chief Minister said that he will get examined the issue regarding addition of 11th and 12th classes in the area.
