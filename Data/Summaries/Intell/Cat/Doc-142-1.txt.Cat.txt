BEIJING, Sept 27 (AFP) - China has arrested a number of suspected separatists in its territory bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan as part of a security clampdown ahead of possible US military strikes in the region, local officials said Thursday. Large numbers of People's Liberation Army troops have also been seen on the move in the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang, to the far west of China, they said. Many people have been arrested in the past weeks, including suspected separatists and criminals, said an official at the minority religious affairs bureau in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China's furthest west city. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday China would take all necessary measures to ensure the stability of its border regions ahead of any US retaliatory strikes. She stressed the atmosphere in Kashgar, an ancient city along the historic Silk Road, was peaceful, although tourism and border trade in the region had been affected by the security situation. In neighboring Hetian city, a hotbed of Muslim separatists in the impoverished southern part of Xinjiang that also borders Pakistan, the situation was also peaceful , said an official at the city's foreign affairs office.
