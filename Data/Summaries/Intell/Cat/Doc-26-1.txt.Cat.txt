USA : NCAA BASKETBALL-SATURDAY NIGHT'S CASUALTIES FINE FOR MONDAY TITLE GAME. Gary Hill INDIANAPOLIS , Indiana 1997-03-30 There were casualties in Saturday night's NCAA semifinal battles but the victors said Sunday that everybody would be ready for Monday's national championship game. He shot just 7-for-21 but still scored a team-high 19 points in the win over Minnesota. _ Right now , I_ 'm fine , _ Mercer told reporters Sunday. _ Come Monday I do_ n't think we_ 'll have time to feel tired. We have one more game left for the national championship and I do_ n't think anybody is going to feel tired because we know we have to go out and do it. _ _ Ron's been playing a_lot_of minutes , _ Kentucky coach Rick Pitino said , _ and people have been hitting him , banging him , and he was physically a_little whipped last night. _ Mercer needed several leg massages on the sidelines and still played 34 of the 40 minutes Saturday , so his coach was letting him rest up Sunday. Arizona's useful backup guard Jason Terry played only 20 minutes , his lowest total of the season , and was taken to a hospital for tests and intravenous treatment after he fell during the Wildcats' upset of North Carolina. _ We were going to put him in late in the game , _ said Arizona coach Lute Olson. _ He had played a lot before that , of_course , but when we_ 're protecting a lead , we like getting four perimeter guys in_there and that gives us another ( ball ) handler , gives us another free throw shooter. _ And I called for him to come and Ed Orr , our trainer , said Coach , he ca_ n't go. If I left the game without bumps and feeling really tired , I would have cheated my team. _ Pitino predicted that Monday's championship game would be more of the same , in view of Kentucky's all-out pressure defence and Arizona's blazing speed : _ I think the team standing at the end is going to win this.
