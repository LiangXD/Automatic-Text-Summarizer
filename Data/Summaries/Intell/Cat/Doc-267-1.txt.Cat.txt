's announcement Friday of a $648.2 million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year. Unisys, whose revenue inched up 3.7% in the quarter to $2.35 billion from $2.27 billion in the year-earlier quarter, had an operating loss of about $30 million. Unisys said that should help it save $500 million a year in costs, again at the high end of the previously reported range of $400 million to $500 million. The tax payments will leave Unisys with $225 million in loss carry-forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters. The tax payments will leave Unisys with $225 million in loss carry-forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters. In addition, Unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $100 million during the quarter, leaving it within $100 million of its goal of a reduction of $500 million by the end of the year. Still, Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter, a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters. That means Unisys must pay about $100 million in interest every quarter, on top of $27 million in dividends on preferred stock. Jim Unruh, Unisys's president, said he is approaching next year with caution. That, he said, is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business: It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to. Securities analysts were even more cautious, having been burned repeatedly on Unisys this year. But the company said Friday that it had losses of $673.3 million through the first nine months, compared with earnings a year earlier of $382.2 million, or $2.22 a share fully diluted, as revenue inched up 1.4% to $7.13 billion from $7.03 billion.
