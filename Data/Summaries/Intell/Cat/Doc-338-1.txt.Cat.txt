Cubans celebrate Venezuelan president's return to power, compare botched coup to Bay of Pigs HAVANA - (AP) -- Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power at a rally Tuesday, likening the failed coup against the Cuban ally to the disastrous U.S.-backed effort to overthrow Fidel Castro's government 41 years ago. About 4,000 Castro supporters -- workers, students, housewives and retirees -- gathered on the streetcorner where the Cuban leader declared the country socialist in a speech on the eve of the April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion by an American-trained exile army. At the Bay of Pigs, a CIA-trained force of about 1,500 exiles invaded in an effort to overthrow Castro's government, which had seized power 28 months before.
