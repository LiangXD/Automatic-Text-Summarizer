Seven months after having rejected the Kyoto Protocol because he considered it to be without scientific basis, detrimental to US economic interests, and unfair in not obliging medium-sized nations (like Brazil and India) to reduce their gas emissions in the same proportion as that imposed on industrialized countries, Bush made public the plan that, he promised, would not have any of the defects of the Kyoto Protocol and would achieve the same, if not better, results. Basically, the Bush plan makes the reduction in pollution gas emissions conditional on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate. The first problem pointed out by critics is that Bush has created a new concept, that of greenhouse gas intensity, which could be defined as the volume of gas emissions divided by GDP. Therefore, that so-called 18 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could, in fact, represent a real increase in the absolute quantity of such gases. Some environmental entities calculate that Bush's plan will lead to the US's emitting! , in 2010, 29 percent more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990. However, after a brief period of shock, Bush resumed his solitary road, as he clearly demonstrated in his State of the Union speech, in which he threatened the Axis of Evil countries (Iran, Iraq, and North Korea) without consulting the Europeans and Japanese, who do not necessarily agree with the appropriateness of antagonizing the governments of those nations.
