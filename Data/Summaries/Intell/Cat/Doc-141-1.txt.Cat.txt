Leaders of the United States probably withheld their breath Monday evening while watching on television what Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to say to his people. After Putin's statement they rubbed their palms at length. Putin has exceeded the positive neutrality policy his country (the Soviet Union at the time) has pursued during the Gulf War, and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable. The situation in which Putin has agreed to open former Soviet military airfields to American armed forces in three (former Soviet) Central Asian countries could be regarded as dramatic. And Putin has established the prospect of taking further steps in this regard. Putin has written the name of Moscow on the registration page of the American side. Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of international terror. In reality, Putin asked for a free hand regarding Chechnia, some understanding, or even that the Americans look the other way. Putin did not receive what he sought in a quick response from Washington, namely, that the State Department would continue to encourage political dialogue between Moscow and the Chechen insurgents. Nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the United States called upon the Chechens to unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups, and that they accept Putin's offer to make peace. If we view this warning against the background that Putin's government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin's hands behind Chechen terrorism, we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow's views. Accordingly, at this time it is your turn to think, Putin said.
