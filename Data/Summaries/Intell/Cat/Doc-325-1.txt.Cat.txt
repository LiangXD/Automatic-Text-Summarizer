U.S. accuses Mugabe of intimidation SubHead: President predicts victory as opposition alleges vote rigging Author: Nicholas Kotch and Cris Chinaka HARARE - On the eve of the presidential vote, Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's President, predicted he would once again storm to victory, as the opposition charged wholesale rigging of the vote and a minister said the army was on high alert. The government of Zimbabwe continues its blatant campaign of violence, intimidation and manipulation of the electoral process in an effort to win the poll.... He said 80 MDC rallies had been stopped by ZANU-PF militias or the police since the presidential campaign began two months ago, leaving him to address 10 major meetings compared with the 50 by Mr. Mugabe, who has barnstormed around the country. Jonathan Moyo, the Information Minister, told reporters in Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo the army had been put on high alert for the poll. Mr. Mugabe, whose campaigning energy belies his 78 years, oozed confidence at his final rally at Bindura, northeast of Harare, and launched a stinging attack on Mr. Blair. Mr. Tsvangirai, who celebrates his 50th birthday tomorrow, accuses Mr. Mugabe of using violence, intimidation, special laws and dirty tricks to fix the two-day election, in which the President faces his toughest challenge since independence in 1980.
