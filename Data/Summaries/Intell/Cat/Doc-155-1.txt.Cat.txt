The Argentine TV station Todo Noticias [ All News ] reported yesterday that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Saturday night telephoned Cordoba Province Governor Jose Manuel de la Sota, of the Justicialist Party (PJ) -- who once served as ambassador to Brazil -- to voice his concern over incidents in the country. Cardoso told De la Sota that the images of the protests at the Plaza de Mayo show a country on the verge of a civil war, one of the channel's journalists commented. Legislators Request Action from the Brazilian Government Concern has spread to Brazilian legislators. Violent attacks at the Argentine legislature sounded alarm bells in the Brazilian political arena, to the point that senators of the official and opposition parties defended more concrete support from the Brazilian Government for Argentina. Deputy Jose Genoino (Workers Party -- Sao Paulo) said that the wave of looting threatens Argentine democracy. President Jose Anibal (Sao Paulo) said that Cardoso has already placed himself at the disposal of the Argentine Government to talk to international financial institutions. For Jose Agripino Maia, PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader in the Senate, although Brazil has detached itself from Argentina, it should not disregard the message of the crises that is devastating the neighboring country. Senator Heloisa Helena (Workers Party -- Alagoas) said that Latin American countries should always join together to speak with international economic institutions, in order to maintain autonomy in their economies: Now we see what happens when one country abdicates its financial autonomy. Analysts: Lack of Alternative for Power Political scientists agree: Argentina lacks a political force that can stand up to Peronism and Radicalism. This is viewed as the main impediment to the establishment of political order in the country. For the political scientist, Argentina cannot wait for assistance from the American Government.
