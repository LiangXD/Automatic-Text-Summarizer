He could grow hedges and wildflowers instead_of sugar beet ; he could turn his fields into areas of & bquo ; quiet countryside enjoyment & equo ; ; he could restore ancient coppices and chalk grassland. Or he could sell most of his land to Mr Big and his house and a_few acres could fall into the hands of a merchant banker who wants somewhere quiet with a paddock for the daughter '_ s ponies. There is a Ministry proposal called & bquo ; extensification. & equo ; It means that the whole farm has to produce 20 per_cent less. It is called & bquo ; set aside. & equo ; A proportion of the farm ? or for that matter all of it ? is set aside , left fallow , mown once a year while the farmer draws a set fee per acre and manages on the rest or gets another job. There are various calculations about how much land is potentially redundant : it could be as many as three million acres. Conservationists , farmers and government agencies all agree that there is an opportunity right_now for debate and then decision. Miss Melinda Appleby is environmental policy adviser to the National Farmers _' Union. She says one fear is that land in the hills will become redundant. & bquo ; These are areas where you could say farming was marginal. There is a big fear in the hills that in_order_to maintain businesses in the lowlands , people will diversify into sheep , and the profitability of sheep in the lowlands will be greater. & equo ; In fact , the Countryside Commission has just announced an imaginative scheme for 12 & bquo ; community forests & equo ; on marginal urban fringe farmland. But the community forests ? plus the Commission '_ s other plan for 100,000 acres of new forest in the Midlands , which will also soak up redundant land ? together with new land released for development , will barely scratch the surface of the problem. There are also emotional objections. & bquo ; We wish to see as many farmers as possible occupying the countryside , & equo ; said Melinda Appleby. & bquo ; We want to see a working countryside and we do n't want to see it fossilised so it '_ s almost like a theme park. & equo ; Farmers have higher hopes of the & bquo ; extensification & equo ; programme in the wings. Some farmers are likely to achieve this by converting to organic farming. To a farmer it '_ s anathema not to produce on land. So & bquo ; extended & equo ; farms will have to leave a wide strip of unsown soil in each field , and let the hedges grow. And they still wo n't feel enthusiastic about extensification. & bquo ; To a farmer it '_ s an anathema not to produce on his land and therefore it '_ s not that he is not being responsible in meeting the challenges. & equo ; Many farmers , it turns out , would n't in the least object to making the countryside ? their countryside ? more attractive. It would also depend on incentives and on some serious stimulus from the conservation lobby. & bquo ; People were extremely disappointed that conservationists could not come up with exciting positive solutions for potential land that might come out_of agriculture , & equo ; says Miss Appleby. Another problem is that the wildlife lobby is divided even over simple things like the future of old farm woodlands. She goes on : & bquo ; The problem with taking a management decision out_of a farmer '_ s hands as an economic decision and putting it into conservationists hands is that the conservationists do n't always agree. & bquo ; In the future , it seems , we are going to be taking arbitrary decisions about what we want from the countryside : the large blue here , a certain bird there , and we are going to manage for those species , which will mean that everything_else will go. & equo ; The countryside may be changing. In a bid to meet the problem halfway , the AFRC has also invested 730,000 in a five-year study of the relationship between wildlife and farming ? and what will happen as land use goes on changing. Both the farmers and the conservationists agree that there ought_to be a debate.
