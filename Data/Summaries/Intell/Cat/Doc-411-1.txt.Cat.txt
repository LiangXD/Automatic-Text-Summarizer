November 15, 1996 Dear Personal Donor: In the short while since Goodwill helped him find his job, Robert has learned to thoroughly clean a motel room in about 40 minutes. In their December, 1995 review of the nation's best charities, U.S. News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five Standout Good Guys. While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us. Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment barrier, the positive effects radiate throughout our community: The business community welcomes not only another worker, but a consumer with increased purchasing power. At Goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day: A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients: You can earn the money to support yourself and your family, she says. A participant in a Goodwill program rushes back from a job interview to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing training program. once his tears have subsided, he confirms what his classmates have already figured out: he just received a job offer -- his first in five years. Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center, a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs. In order to develop job skills, a man with some serious disabilities begins working in Goodwill's industrial division. These people and their successes are real. Just like the impact Goodwill's work has on our community. A real difference in people's lives -- in all of our lives. Your support helps provide real solutions.
