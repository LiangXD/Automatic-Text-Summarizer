LONDON, Jan 19 (AFP) -- British members of parliament Saturday [19 January] called for a meeting with the US ambassador and urged the government to make a clear statement in response to growing concerns about the treatment of al-Qa'ida suspects, including three Britons, held at an US detention centre in Cuba. The United States says the detainees are illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, and thus do not have rights under the Geneva Convention of 1949, which sets out the laws of war. Ann Clwyd, chairperson for the committee and a member of the ruling Labour party, said it was playing with words to suggest that the detainees were not prisoners of war. Clwyd said the purpose of meeting Farish was to to voice concern about the treatment of all the people taken prisoner in Afghanistan, not just the ones being held in Cuba, and we want an acceptance that they are prisoners of war.
