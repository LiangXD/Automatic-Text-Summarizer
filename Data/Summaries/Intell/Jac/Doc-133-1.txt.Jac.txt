SHANGHAI, Oct 16 (AFP) - Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar warned Tuesday that prolonged military attacks on Afghanistan could destabilise the Islamic world and reiterated calls for the US to end the campaign quickly. Islamic countries are with the US in combatting terrorism but we don't want it to be prolonged because it can create trouble and instability all around the Islamic world, he said. Syed Hamid said the international community must deal with terrorism rationally and form a new security architecture to combat what he described as a new dimension of crime against humanity in the long term. This is not the conventional security but it is internal and we must look at terrorism and its sources, he said. Syed Hamid said critics must also accept that the war against terrorism could affect civil liberties. Mahathir has urged the United Nations to convene an international meeting on terrorism.
