INSIGHT $- Dow tests critical support at 6600. Richard Jacobsen NEW YORK 1997-03-31 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was testing critical technical support at the 6600 level on Monday during a second session of steep losses. The 6600 level _ is very important and if it should happen to break that would mean 6300 , _ said Robert Dickey , technical analyst at Dain Bosworth. The seven-percent yield on the long bond is seen as drawing investors away from stocks into bonds. Analysts said that a move by the long bond yield through the 7.2 percent level would mean an even more serious psycholgical and technical breakdown for stocks. Techical analysts said the Dow support around the 6600 level was built by Dow highs in November and December and its January low. He said he did not expect any broad rallies off the support levels. _ I would only look for a technical rebound , not much of a rally , from any one of these supports , _ Harrington said. _ I think the market has broken down and I think you_ 're going to see continued and increased volatility. _ Technical analysts said the put/call ratio has been relatively low in recent sessions , a sign that there was not sufficient bearish sentiment to provide support for stocks.
