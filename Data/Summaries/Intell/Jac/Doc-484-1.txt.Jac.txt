What exactly then is a manned spaceship? The spaceship is composed of three cylindrical capsules, with the orbiter capsule fitted on the forefront. Three reclining seats will be installed in the capsule for astronauts. At the rear of the spaceship is the propulsion capsule to provide thrust to the spaceship in orbital control and return to earth. In accordance with the plan, China's manned spaceship will conduct a series of scientific tests and earth observation after it is launched into space. Therefore, the manned spaceflight will enable China to have preliminary space combat capability. However, it is understood that China has successfully resolved this problem to provide sufficient power supply for its spaceship. By referring to the designs of the Russia spaceship Soyuz, it is very possible that China will apply the lift control technology in its manned spaceship. The next step after the land recovery, China may change to recovering the manned spaceship on the sea. For the next flight, the top of the spaceship's orbiter capsule may be installed with a docking module for docking tests between two spaceships.
