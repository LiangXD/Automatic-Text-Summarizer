US YIELD CURVE $- Bills said the place to be for now. Bills $-- primarily three $- and six-month $-- have outperformed the rest of the yield curve since last Tuesday's quarter-point rate hike by the Fed. The six-month bill rate was at 5.31 percent , down about five basis points from early last week. For_example , at Monday afternoon's weekly auction , Treasury sold only $14 billion three $- and six-month bills $-- way down from $23 billion in the prior few auctions. Some of the money in stocks was shifted to bills , traders said , although a major allocation out_of stocks is not expected. _ Unless you see stocks down 1,000 points , you wo_ n't see a meaningful shift , _ said Mark Mahoney , Treasury market strategist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
