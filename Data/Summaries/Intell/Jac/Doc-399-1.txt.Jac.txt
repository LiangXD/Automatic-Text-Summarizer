HARARE, Zimbabwe: A defiant President Robert Mugabe said his party had lost ground to the opposition through complacency, but would win this weekend's presidential elections anyway, state radio reported on Tuesday. The U.S. State Department released a human rights report on Zimbabwe Monday that accused the government of extrajudicial killings, undermining the independence of the judiciary and waging a systematic campaign of violence targeting supporters and potential supporters of the opposition. Security forces tortured opponents, ruling party militants abducted people, and police arrested opposition supporters who were themselves the victims of crimes. In his speech on Monday, Mugabe thanked African leaders for refusing to buckle to pressure to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth of Britain and its former territories at a summit of the 54-nation grouping in Australia. Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand demanded the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth to protest state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses against the opposition. The problems of human rights and good governance are mirrored in their countries, Biti said. The opposition accuses the government of using violence, intimidation and new security laws to cow its voters and to prevent it from effectively campaigning. Foreign diplomats based in Harare said Monday police prevented them from finishing a meeting on Monday with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai. State radio also reported Monday that three opposition lawmakers tried to bribe Zimbabwe's air force commander to help calm security forces if Mugabe were removed. Opposition officials said the claim was part of a government smear campaign.
