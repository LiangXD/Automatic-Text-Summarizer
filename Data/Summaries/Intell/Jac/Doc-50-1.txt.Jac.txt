SOUTH KOREA : E.Asia Oilseeds $- CBOT soybeans jump in Asia trade. E.Asia Oilseeds $- CBOT soybeans jump in Asia trade. July soybean futures climbed 12 cents to $8.70 a bushel. _ There must be some traders who expect the USDA soybean stock report to be lower than the market average forecast of 1.091 billion bushels , _ a trader with Korea's National Livestock Cooperatives Federation ( NLCF ) said. Oilseed demand in South Korea remains robust and domestic mills are apprehensive a bullishly construed USDA report could create a spike in prices. _ We have to hurry to cover our oilseed requirements for arrival from July onward as oilseed prices are likely to rise , _ a trader with Big Feed Mills said. _ We also expect a bullish USDA report for soybean and soymeal. _ The NLCF will tender for 42,000 tonnes of rapeseed meal , 30,000 tonnes of tapioca hard pellet and 8,000 tonnes of grain screening pellet by 0200 GMT on Tuesday. In Japan , oilseed importers are covered until May shipment , but will probably buy for June onwards if the USDA report is bullish , traders said. _ The stock figure is more crucial than plantings. Philippine soybean and soymeal buyers were also sidelined by high prices and are waiting for the outcome of the USDA report , dealers said.
