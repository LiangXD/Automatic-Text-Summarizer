NCAA BASKETBALL-SATURDAY NIGHT'S CASUALTIES FINE FOR MONDAY TITLE GAME. We have one more game left for the national championship and I do_ n't think anybody is going to feel tired because we know we have to go out and do it. _ _ Ron's been playing a_lot_of minutes , _ Kentucky coach Rick Pitino said , _ and people have been hitting him , banging him , and he was physically a_little whipped last night. _ Mercer needed several leg massages on the sidelines and still played 34 of the 40 minutes Saturday , so his coach was letting him rest up Sunday. Arizona's useful backup guard Jason Terry played only 20 minutes , his lowest total of the season , and was taken to a hospital for tests and intravenous treatment after he fell during the Wildcats' upset of North Carolina. _ We were going to put him in late in the game , _ said Arizona coach Lute Olson. _ He had played a lot before that , of_course , but when we_ 're protecting a lead , we like getting four perimeter guys in_there and that gives us another ( ball ) handler , gives us another free throw shooter. _ And I called for him to come and Ed Orr , our trainer , said Coach , he ca_ n't go. He was feeling very faint and just very , very ill at that point. _ After the game , he was checked. Olson added : _ He did leave a deposit in the ambulance on the way to the hospital , so he was a sick puppy last night. If I left the game without bumps and feeling really tired , I would have cheated my team. _ Pitino predicted that Monday's championship game would be more of the same , in view of Kentucky's all-out pressure defence and Arizona's blazing speed : _ I think the team standing at the end is going to win this.
