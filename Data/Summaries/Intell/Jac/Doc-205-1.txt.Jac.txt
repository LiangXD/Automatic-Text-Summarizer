In discussing the draft regulations to put the Kyoto Protocol into force, Japan openly took issue with the draft regulations only because the contents of the regulations were not in its favor. Japan calculated that it would suffer a tremendous loss, if the draft regulations were ever passed intact and would be adopted as a legal document. For the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force, 55 countries have to ratify it. Emphasizing the significance of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, Japan loudly trumpeted at that time that the adoption of the protocol was produced by the role Japan had played. Japan even called for working out practical measures to have it enter into force. Nonetheless, Japan, changing its stand this time, opposed the draft regulations to put the Kyoto Protocol into force and even called for liquidation of the draft. According to the Kyoto Protocol, by 2008 - 2012 Japan is supposed to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by six percent from the 1990 level. Accordingly, Japan would never readily agree on putting the Kyoto Protocol into force. In the course of calculating the gains and losses of the Kyoto Protocol and trying to figure out what it should do, Japan found a good excuse. The United States, which has to do the most to implement the Kyoto Protocol, has come out opposing the draft regulations. In the midst of this situation, a Japanese official visited the United States and received the instruction that Japan should avoid inordinate behavior with respect to the issue of implementing the Kyoto Protocol. What Japan is doing with respect to the issue of putting the Kyoto Protocol into force is tantamount to an act of betrayal against mankind in the effort to protect human lives, health, and the earth's atmosphere. Japan should be condemned by the world for that.
