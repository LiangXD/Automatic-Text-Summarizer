USA : Consumer Reports finds sport/utilities unsafe. Consumer Reports finds sport/utilities unsafe. Mark Wallace NEW YORK 1996-08-20 Consumer Reports magazine slapped a _ Not Acceptable _ label on two sport/utility vehicles Tuesday , saying the light trucks _ have too great a tendency to roll over in certain situations. _ The magazine said the 1995 and 1996 models of the Isuzu Trooper , made by Isuzu Motors Ltd. , and the 1996 Acura SLX , also made by Isuzu but sold by Honda Motor Co. Ltd. , were a danger to consumers because they _ tipped up high on two wheels _ in road tests. Consumer Reports also asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate the Trooper and SLX and called for more stringent government oversight of vehicles with narrow wheelbases.
