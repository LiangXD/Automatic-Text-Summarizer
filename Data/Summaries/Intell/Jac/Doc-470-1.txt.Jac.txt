Israeli Arab leaders yesterday pledged to fight a proposed 25%-30% cut in National Insurance Institute child benefits for those who have not served in the army or completed national service. Shawqi Khatib, chairman of the monitoring committee of the Israeli Arab leadership, said Arabs would be hardest hit if the government approves the cutbacks in child benefits. Khatib, who also chairs the forum of Arab council heads, said the leadership is diametrically opposed to any cutbacks, particularly when those affecting the lower socio-economic strata of society. Those out of work now, who rely on benefits to support their families, will find themselves in an even worse situation, he said. We applauded this move because it was not only just, but it made us begin to feel that we, as Arabs, were an integral part of Israeli society.
