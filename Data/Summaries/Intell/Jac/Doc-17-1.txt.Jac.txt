TENNIS-HINGIS RULES THE TENNIS WORLD. At age 16 , Martina Hingis of Switzerland has swept aside her last 26 opponents on the fast track to becoming the youngest player ever to grab the top ranking in the world. It_ 's great to go out_there and play in front of 10,000 people. _ Even the absence from the Lipton Championships of Steffi Graf , who lost her top ranking to the charging Hingis , was of no great concern to the Czech-born Swiss sensation. _ It does_ n't matter to me if she ca_ n't play , compete at this tournament , _ Hingis says of Graf. _ It_ 's not my problem. Rollerblades also fit into the suitcase and residents on Key Biscayne have stopped and stared as the Swiss miss skates by. _ I ca_ n't be all_the_time here at the courts , _ Hingis said. _ It would just get crazy if you would spend all_the_time on the site. Surprisingly mature for her age , Hingis never appears intimidated by opponents or anything_else. Nor does she anticipate feeling fearful of weighty expectations. _ What should I be afraid of ? _ said Hingis , tossing a questioning look. _ Why should I be worried ?
