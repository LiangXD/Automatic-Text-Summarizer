Officials bristle at US human rights report Response is being prepared Khalil Fleihan Daily Star correspondent Local authorities have expressed dissatisfaction - but not surprise - with regard to excerpts about Lebanon in the US State Department's annual report on human rights, a copy of which has been delivered to the Foreign Ministry. An official source who described the reaction on Tuesday said the criticism was an annual event and emphasized that it was not directed at human rights in Lebanon only, but covered several other countries in as well. The source said that the ministry would soon deliver copies of the report to the various ministries concerned, especially the Interior and Municipalities Ministry, prior to relaying its observations to the State Department in Washington. The report was seen as discrediting Lebanon by portraying the country as being undemocratic or uncivilized and abusing human rights, the source added. On the other hand, the report praised the role played by the Lebanese press, describing it as containing daily criticism of the government and its practices.
