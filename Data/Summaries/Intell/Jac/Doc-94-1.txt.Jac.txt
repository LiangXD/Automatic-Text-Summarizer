June and September mid-curve volatilities each rose to 17.0 percent from 16.3 percent previously. Interest rate futures' selloff late last week provided the catalyst for volatility to ascend , Eurodollar traders said. Among the larger transactions in Eurodollar options trading was a Japanese bank's sale of 1,000 June 93.75 puts at a premium of two basis points. A U.S. brokerage firm sold 500 June 94.00 puts at 9.5 basis points and 1,000 June 94.25 puts at 26.5 basis points , and a third firm sold 1,000 September 93.75 puts at 23 basis points. Treasury bond volatility held fairly steady , with both May and June options pegged late in the session at 9.5 percent. Some analysts predicted bond volatility would start to attract a bid heading into Friday's U.S. jobs report.
