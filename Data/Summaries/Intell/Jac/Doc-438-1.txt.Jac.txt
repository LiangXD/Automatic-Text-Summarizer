As you begin that process this year, I would like to ask you to consider helping young people in Marion County toward more positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the Marion County Commission on Youth, Inc. MCCOY Inc., originally founded as a government agency but re-organized in 1993 as an independent not-for-profit, is a county-wide youth services coordinating, planning, and convening agency. I have enclosed a packet of information about MCCOY and its work as well as an application with various options for supporting the youth of our community. Please consider joining together with your fellow citizens in support of the work of the Marion County Commission on Youth.
