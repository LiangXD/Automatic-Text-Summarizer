Courtaulds PLC announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value. Courtaulds' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence, valuing the entire company at about #1.44 billion. Some analysts have said Courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined. Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year. Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake, Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy.
