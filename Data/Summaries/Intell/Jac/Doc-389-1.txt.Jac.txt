Bush Takes Great Leap Forward In Pledging U.S. Help In Defending Taiwan In a closed-door meeting in Florida last week, the Bush administration took a great leap forward in its declared policy that Taiwan remain separate from China so long as the people of Taiwan wish, even if that requires U.S. military force. He has cautioned, however, that the United States expected Taiwan to avoid provoking China. Among them, they make every weapon Taiwan could possibly want to fend off the expanding might of China. China's military threat to Taiwan is not immediate. It said that if China attacked Taiwan, the United States will respond appropriately in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act. The TRA, adopted after Carter broke relations with Taiwan, commits the United States to provide defensive arms to Taiwan and to view a threat from China with grave concern. Bush has repeatedly referred to the TRA in a not-so-subtle message to China that the law is the bedrock of his posture on Taiwan. At the same time, he said the United States would do whatever it takes to help defend Taiwan. Whatever decision Bush makes, a defense official said, the Pacific Command is ready to respond to any potential crisis, including the use of force against Taiwan by China.
