The United States says the detainees are illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, and thus do not have rights under the Geneva Convention of 1949, which sets out the laws of war. Ann Clwyd, chairperson for the committee and a member of the ruling Labour party, said it was playing with words to suggest that the detainees were not prisoners of war. Clwyd said the purpose of meeting Farish was to to voice concern about the treatment of all the people taken prisoner in Afghanistan, not just the ones being held in Cuba, and we want an acceptance that they are prisoners of war. It's time we had a clear statement on the position of the prisoners and what the British role now is.
