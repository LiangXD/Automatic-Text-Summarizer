Coast Guard attempts rescue after freak wave smashes race yacht in Pacific ALAMEDA, Calif. ? The US Coast Guard was Sunday attempting to reach a yacht that ran into trouble 400 miles off the California coast after a freak wave injured several crew members and broke the vessel's steering system. We were racing along in 40-60 knot gusts, the boat's skipper Juan Coetzer said. Mark Burkes was on the helm at the time, he added. A US Coast Guard cutter and helicopter were en route to the stricken vessel and were due to arrive there by 8:30am local time, race organizers said. Coast Guard Petty Officer Levi Read told NewsCore he was only aware of three injured on the vessel, but would know more once they reached the boat. At this time the extent of the injuries is not fully known but they are considered serious, the Coast Guard statement added.
