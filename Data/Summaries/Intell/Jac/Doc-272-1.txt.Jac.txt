Crossland Savings Bank's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because, under the proposed guidelines, its $380 million of preferred stock doesn't meet the core capital criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. Crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan. Additionally, Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $175.5 million, or $13.44 a share, compared with net income of $27.1 million, or $1.16 a share, a year ago. Net interest income for the third quarter declined to $35.6 million from $70.1 million a year ago.
