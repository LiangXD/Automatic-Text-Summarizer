But the EU is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce US emissions. The intensity target proposed allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change. The Climate Change Convention of 1992, to which the US is a Party, requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels. Current emission projections for the US indicate an increase of 39% above 1990 levels in 2012. While the intensity improvements may reduce this to around 33%, this is still a very substantial increase in absolute emissions. By 2005, the EU intends to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of all CO2 emissions in 2010. However, mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions at company level would be necessary to adequately assess whether the proposals by President Bush represent an effort comparable to the ones under the Kyoto Protocol.
