US Ambassador to Indonesia Ralph L. Boyce praised the Indonesian government on Monday [18 Mar] for its efforts to protect foreign investors in the country, including Americans, but warned that investors were still concerned about the security of their investments. Some local radical groups threatened to attack U.S. interests and citizens in Indonesia following the U.S. government's move to strike at Afghanistan several months ago. The AmCham delegation is in Indonesia for a two-day visit to assess business opportunities in this country. The delegation is led by AmCham Singapore president Landis W. Hicks. Meanwhile, Rini said after a meeting with the AmCham delegation that almost all of the delegation members had praised the current security situation in the country.
