According to US news media, that coup in Venezuela had something to do with the United States. Coup d'etat is an unusual means to seize a country's political power. By the same token, the coup in Venezuela has incurred widespread condemnation and objection from the international community, including the Latin American states, except the United States. This is far out of tune with the attitude the United States used to take when a coup occurred in other countries. Just as Venezuela restored its constitutional rule and Chavez was returned to power, the New York Times came up with a shocking story: the US Government and senior military officials were in contact with the Venezuelan coup organizers. States supports democracy and that we in no way would support any coups or unconstitutional activity. Why didn't the United States inform Venezuela's constitutional government of the coup attempt by Rincon and the others? After taking the Office of Presidency, Chavez has implemented an independent foreign policy and seemed to be not in step with the United States in many respects. Probably this is the major reason why the United States is happy to see a change of government in Venezuela. Hence one can see that it is not to be surprised that the United States chimed in with the Venezuela's coup organizers.
