John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5% annually through the next three years. Since 1983, Westinghouse has shed 70 businesses that it didn't expect to produce 10% operating margins while acquiring 55 businesses. A bright spot is the company's power-generation business, which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years. Mr. Marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company's target goal of 8.5%. Westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to 25% of total corporate sales from 20% last year. Mr. Marous said Westinghouse would own 70% of the facility. Company officials also said that any gain from the sale of Westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of Asea Brown Boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
