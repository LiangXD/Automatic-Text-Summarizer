ICRC envoys are discussing with US officials whether to release the number of detainees and their nationalities, said Christen. As long as this confidentiality will allow us to get results in the humanitarian sphere we will keep to it, he said, adding it would be the first of a series of visits. The number of detainees being held at the isolated US military outpost on Cuba's southwestern coast rose on Thursday to 110 after the arrival of another 30 prisoners from Afghanistan. The ICRC considers, however, that they are prisoners of war protected by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949. Christen said detainees from the battle field did not exist as a category under humanitarian law, adding that in an international armed conflict anyone captured on the battlefield was presumed a prisoner of war. Asked about special courts to be set up by the Bush administration to try the al-Qaeda detainees, Christen pointed out the courts were not yet operating and their procedures were still unknown.
