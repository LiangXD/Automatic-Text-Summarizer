We don't waste time as we are helping the community. While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us. At Goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day: A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients: You can earn the money to support yourself and your family, she says. Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center, a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs. On his way home, he shares the story with four people at a street corner. He proudly leaves Goodwill to support himself. These people and their successes are real. Just like the impact Goodwill's work has on our community. Real results. A real difference in people's lives -- in all of our lives. The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no time to waste. Your support helps provide real solutions.
