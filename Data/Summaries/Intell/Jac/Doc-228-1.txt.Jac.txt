However, it will be difficult for Japan to provide support to the US, as it did when the US attacked Afghanistan, if US forces launch military action against Iraq. At a meeting of several officials held at the outset of the summit, the President first took up economic issues and then referred to his axis of evil remark. It is possible that if the US military attack Iraq, Japan, which has shown understanding of the axis of evil remark, will be asked to provide active support to the US as it did during US attacks on Afghanistan. If Japan does not give any support to possible US attacks on Iraq despite its understanding of the axis of evil rhetoric, Bush's expectations on the Koizumi administration will certainly change to disappointment. Although the Japanese Government has expressed understanding of Bush's axis of evil remark, it does not hope to see the US taking military action. However, it is unclear whether Japan can actually prevent the US from taking military action.
