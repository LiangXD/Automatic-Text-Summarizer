A cargo ship intercepted in the Channel after a tip-off that it might be carrying terrorist materials was today given the all clear, police said. But after a detailed examination of the ship, which is currently moored off the Isle of Wight, nothing suspicious was found, police said. The MV Nisha is operated by the Great Eastern Shipping Company, based in Bombay, India. We had anticipated that detailed examination of the ship might take rather longer. The cargo ship Nisha was intercepted and boarded as part of an intelligence-led operation. Thankfully, the ship has been proved not to pose a danger to the public. The ship then went on to Mauritius to pick up the sugar and left on November 20 to transport it to Britain.
