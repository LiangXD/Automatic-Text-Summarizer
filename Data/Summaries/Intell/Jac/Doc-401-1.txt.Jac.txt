US human rights report termed inaccurate ISLAMABAD, March 5: The government on Tuesday rejected the US State Department Report on human rights as factually inaccurate and unwarranted adding that it reflected tendency of some states to sit in judgment on others. The reports fails to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives by the government of Pakistan to promote and protect human rights, said a statement issued by Foreign Office spokesman in which the report was termed as factually inaccurate and unwarranted. Enlisting these initiatives, it recalled that these include promulgation of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, national policy and plan of action for elimination of child labour and establishment of a fund for rehabilitation of working children.
