Herb Dhaliwal, the federal Energy Minister, weighed in with even more qualifications: Some important details have to be worked out before Canada ratifies the Kyoto Protocol, he said. Another sign the debate is intensifying emerged last week at a global warming conference in Ottawa. Lorne Taylor, the Alberta Environment Minister, estimated the costs of Kyoto to the Canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year. At the same conference, Taylor's federal counterpart, David Anderson, announced that the Alberta numbers were absurd. Implementing Kyoto would cost a paltry $500-million, he said, and added more ominously that the issue, technically, is that international relations fall within the purview of the federal government. The first, as the numbers tossed about by Taylor and Anderson indicate, is centred on costs of compliance. Taylor may have offered a more prudent guess, but the fact is, accurate estimates of the costs of policies designed to reduce selected gas emissions are impossible. Underlying the uncertainties regarding costs are more fundamental uncertainties about the scientific evidence. Last spring the American National Academy of Science warned that because there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally, any estimates of either the magnitude or the direction of future warming must be highly tentative. Finally, vast uncertainty is built into computer models of climate change. To get the cubes down to a useful size -- around 20 miles a side -- would take computers about 1,000 times as powerful as are currently available. In short, because the estimates of the scale and timing of atmospheric warming are so uncertain, it is just not possible to assess the costs and benefits. The fact is, Kyoto is without principles and no one has a clue what it means.
