USA : Wall St stocks slide for second straight session. Wall St stocks slide for second straight session. Richard Melville NEW YORK 1997-03-31 Heightened concern about the outlook for interest rates sent Wall Street stocks skidding for a second straight session on Monday and dragged the Dow industrials to one of their sharpest losses ever. The declines by technology issues , coupled with weak showing by health-care stocks , pulled Nasdaq down 28 points to 1222. Analysts said some of the activity bore the earmarks of portfolio window-dressing by managers leery of showing large stock holdings in the uncertain climate. _ Today was the last day of the quarter , and it looked like we got some reverse window-dressing , _ said Peter Canelo , chief investment strategist at Dean Witter. _ All of a sudden nobody wants to show they own any stocks , _ he said. XBD fell 26 points , or 4.6 percent , to 490.31. Among individual issues , Ascend Communications Inc staggered lower after announcing it would acquire Cascade Communications Corp in a $3.7 billion stock swap. Ascend shares tumbled 11-1/4 to 40-3/4 , while Casdade shares shed two points to 26-3/8.
