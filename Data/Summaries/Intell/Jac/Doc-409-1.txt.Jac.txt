Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job. For 18 long months Michael could not find a job. Finally, Michael called Goodwill. After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person for the job. At last, he has found success in a job that he loves. With support from people like you, they can overcome their barriers and earn success and the self-sufficiency that comes with it. Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public support and more paying taxes. Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three-quarters of a million dollars in public assistance. Your gift will help give new meaning to the word success -- for people who have seldom had reason to use the word. For every dollar of public support Goodwill received last year, we returned $1.59 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments.
