The two warrants -- from 1998 and 2000 -- were released at a press conference here by Interpol President Jesus Espigares of Spain and Secretary General Ronald K. Noble of the United States. The 1998 warrant charged that Bin-Ladin, a Saudi billionaire housed as a guest in Afghanistan, was involved in the 1994 murder of two Germans in Syrte, Libya. The other warrant, from April 4, 2000, was drafted at the request of the US Government and includes a detailed description of the man who tops the US Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) most wanted list. The force, based in Lyon, France, will work non-stop to help to filter any information coming from Interpol country members, Noble said. Interpol will meet in Budapest from September 24-29, where member countries will discuss methods of bringing those responsible for the attacks to justice, Espigares and Noble said.
