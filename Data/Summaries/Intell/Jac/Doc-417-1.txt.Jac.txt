My name is Bonnie Rindner and I was born in San Antonio, TX, and the story I'm going to tell is about my mother. There was no money to buy any presents at all, um, for the children, and my grandfather, who was killed when my mother was 16, this was, of course, way before that, um, he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was he, he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given them all to Santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves. And although I never met my grandfather, I have never forgotten that story and when I hear of him I think what a wonderful, wonderful person he must have been. Oh, I have lived in Charlotte, um, for a year. Um, I lived in Charlotte for five years.
