Stephanopoulos Analyzes His Own Crime There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week this morning, furrow-browed and heartbroken with all the evidence coming out against the president. Stephanopoulos wants to run for the Senate and doesn't want to seem a Clinton stooge. By lending credence to the Lewinsky charges, and treating Clinton's familiar defenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, Stephanopoulos shows he's not a fool. The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in the first place. (Don't say Stephanopoulos didn't know. Clinton has no character problem, Stephanopoulos declares. (Today, of course, the president's defenders claim that Clinton admitted infidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply didn't care.) Near the end of The War Room, Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours, which he is about to publicize. Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping quiet. You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection techniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught. He was one of Clinton's principal enablers, to use a word employed by Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times. When Democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton, they don't need to look much further than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos, Carville (and a cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992.
