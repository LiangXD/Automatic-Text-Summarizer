Midweek: Wheel turns with a vengeance for the Taliban AS Camp X-ray in Cuba's Guantanamo Bay continues to fill with Muslim militants who had sworn to die rather than be captured, even the little we see of their situation makes it clear they're in hell. The United States dismisses such concerns: it's a prison, after all; remember the Black Hole of Mazar-iSharif. It's been almost a year since the Taliban blew up those monumental 1,500-year-old sandstone statues in northcentral Afghanistan, at which time the only way for the rest of us to handle the insult to human sensibilities was to emulate the Gautama Buddha himself, and profess relief. Those statues probably hadn't been a good likeness of him, anyway. His clothes probably never looked quite like that - the statues' fashion sense had been clearly influenced by the Greeks, what with Alexander the Great having passed through on his way to giving up with India. So he is unlikely to have been enamoured of statues. Besides, those statues had been defaced long before they were finally reduced to rubble. Judging by its demeanour, the statue hadn't felt a thing. The veil of compassion was hardly elastic enough to pull over those two great big holes in the earth. And so it has come ironically to pass that, one year on, a new Afghan order is dreaming of rebuilding those statues, while what's left of the Taliban now sits in cells a world away, beardless, bald and clad in saffron.
