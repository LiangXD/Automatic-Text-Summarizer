On the second day of their trial , former minister Kim Woo-suk said he thought the 200 million won ( $223,000 ) delivered in apple crates was just a gift from Chung Tae-soo to use as political funds. _ I received the money from Chung Tae-soo but I thought it was simply a donation to political funds , _ Kim told the court. _ But it was wrong of me to take the money considering I was a construction minister at the time. _ He is charged with receiving bribes in return for setting up roads leading to Hanbo's steel mills. Three ruling party legislators and close aides to President Kim , Hong In-gil , Hwang Byung-tai and Chung Jae-chull also admitted receiving from gifts in cash from the Hanbo founder.
