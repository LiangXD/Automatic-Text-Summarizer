here the female may produce 800,000 eggs which hatch within 36 hours into larvae. traditionally , prawn farmers have trapped these young adults ( or & bquo post-larvae & equo as they are called ) and put them into ponds. ideally , farmers would like to grow the larvae from eggs , and so a new industry ? prawn hatcheries ? has grown up_to meet the demand. during the larval cycle , prawns change their diet dramatically , from plant plankton to animal plankton and finally to the creatures which live in the sediment. we '_ ve learnt about its physiology and how it changes to keep pace with the larva '_ s changing eating habits. & bquo we know how fast food moves through its gut , how much energy it takes to make one post-larval prawn from the day it hatches , and_so_on. we '_ ve learnt an enormous amount because the microcapsule is such an ideal tool for simplifying and controlling food intake. & equo dr jones and his team are now extending their work to other species , and to the post-larval stage , which leads to the ultimate product ? the prawn on the end of your fork. but dr jones '_ s involvement with industry has led him into difficulties ? which lend a critical edge to the parable. & bquo frippak support our work generously , & equo he says. & bquo but they are understandably reluctant to pay for research students , because they will probably go off and join the competition.
