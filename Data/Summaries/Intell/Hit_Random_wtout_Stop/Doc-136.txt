during the past weeks europe and america witnessed the arrangement of important international conferences, which could on the one hand guarantee the peace and stability of the world, or could instead deteriorate the conditions. the conference in new york, which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms, and the genoa conference which had a much wider and extended agenda, had two common features between them. the governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda, including: economic globalization, the anti-missile shield defense project, the kyoto protocol and environmental protection, the political and military crises in the middle east, the balkans, and afghanistan, moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries, and... [as published] concerning the environmental protection issue, the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases, and warming up of the planet earth's climate too, which was somehow related to the [agenda of] even the eagerness for playing an intermediary role in the middle east crisis has given rise to fierce competition between america, european union, and russia and china. at the bonn conference too, the agenda was to tackle and discuss the most urgent and indispensable factors concerning the life of humankind. to recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of new york and genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely.
