latin american and european government leaders today joined protesters in buenos aires, wall street traders and financial experts in putting at least part of the blame for argentina's problems on the lending agency and the clinton and bush administrations. treasury secretary paul h. o'neill came into office publicly denouncing multibillion dollar bailouts, saying that either they fail outright or they allow foreign governments to get away with bad policymaking and investors to get away with bad bets. when argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, bush administration officials did not take a firm position, allowing the i.m.f. to make the call on withholding additional loans, people involved in the fund's deliberations said. even the harshest critics of the i.m.f. put most of the blame for argentina's current plight on a succession of governments in buenos aires. moreover, it is difficult to place blame for argentina's economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy was designed by argentina itself, sometimes over the objections of the fund's economists. at an august meeting at i.m.f. headquarters, fund officials told domingo cavallo, argentina's economy minister, that the country would be better off delaying debt payments. though there were unique elements, argentina's demise seems certain to add to the doubts about the wisdom of bailouts, doubts that have grown in recent years.
