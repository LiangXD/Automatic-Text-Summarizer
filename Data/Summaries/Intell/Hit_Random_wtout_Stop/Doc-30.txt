normal individuals maintain the concentration of blood sugar at a constant level by their own insulin , which causes cells in muscle , liver and fatty tissue ? target cells ? to take up excess circulating sugar and store it. either no insulin is produced ( type 1 diabetes ) or the muscle , liver and fat cells fail to respond to insulin ( type 2 ). when insulin was isolated at the toronto medical school in 1922 , a far-sighted decision by an executive of the eli lilly company ensured the dominance of his firm in commercial production. most diabetes is the type 2 form , in which the patient still generates insulin , but the body '_ s target cells fail to respond to it. analysis of cells from these rats showed that drug action had interfered with the expression of genes for some of the proteins designed to move sugar into muscle and fat cells , exactly the target tissues which must be stimulated by insulin if they are to take up excess sugar. this provides circumstantial evidence that some cases of human type 2 diabetes result from a similar failure. this provides circumstantial evidence that some cases of human type 2 diabetes result from a similar failure.
