dice rolling with the times. the centuries-old five-dice game of liardice ? or liar '_ s dice as it is called in north america ? has a modern problem. it needs space to throw the dice and this is not practical in planes and trains where it can do most to relieve the boredom of a long journey. this dilemma for a game with millions of followers worldwide has proved to be a & bquo bunch of sixes & equo opportunity for welsh inventor don hughes , a self-confessed liardice buff , who claims to have beaten the far east electronics industry literally at its own game by developing an electronic version that is hardly bigger than a credit card. it generates the random numbers for the dice from reading the device '_ s internal clocks at the instant the & bquo roll & equo button is pressed. mr hughes believes it is the only such electronic game aimed at an adult market and the only one not designed and manufactured in the far east. it could prove to be a good roll of the dice , for mr hughes has also written a book on the mathematics of five-dice games and devised special packaging to exploit the game '_ s addictiveness by allowing it to be played while it is hanging from the supermarket shelf.
