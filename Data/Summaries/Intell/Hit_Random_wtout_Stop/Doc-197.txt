public dissatisfaction and an increase in the people's anger in this country have finally resulted in the collapse of fernando delaroe's government following several days of protest. the important point is that argentina has enjoyed the imf's advice in the execution of these policies. the main problem that caused the recent shock is also a result of the restrictive economic policies that have been adopted on the advice of imf experts. incidentally, the riots also occurred following the imf's announcement of argentina's debts. what is clear is that argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today. although imf officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an imf executive delegation is actively making changes to argentina's economy. anyway, now in addition to the imf, the us government, as the biggest investor in argentina's economy, is ignoring its commitments in the current situation.
