rumor has it that the late author of the greenhouse model told academician roald sagdeyev: i'm a little uneasy when i tell the americans about my model, because it suggests that russia's agriculture will gain from global warming, while america's agriculture will lose. models are flawed, including the greenhouse model, and the only thing that is beyond dispute is that warming is underway, and the contribution of human beings to this alarming condition is very large, possible at least 30 percent. it was aimed at reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and assigns countries quotas on their emissions. a decision was adopted at the first conference of convention participants (1995, berlin) to begin phased actions to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases and to create an appropriate system of ecological-economic relations. a decision was adopted at the first conference of convention participants (1995, berlin) to begin phased actions to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases and to create an appropriate system of ecological-economic relations. the obligations of foreign countries under the kyoto protocol developed countries and transitional economies must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 by at least 5 percent from the recognized baseline year of 1990. we emit greenhouse gases, we thaw out the frozen regions that emit methane, we destroy forests, and in the south, deserts are expanding, a process that alters the heat exchange between the earth's surface and the atmosphere.
