nobody is happy when a former president is taken before the tribunal in the hague, but it had to happen and the sooner the better, yugoslav deputy prime minister miroljub labus told reporters on his arrival here. the donors' conference, co-sponsored by the european commission and the world bank, was hoping to raise 1.25 billion dollars (1.47 billion euros) for yugoslavia this year for urgent repairs to infrastructure and salaries to teachers and other civil servants. by midday, the conference had garnered pledges totalling some 1.37 billion dollars in grants and low- or no-interest loans over the next three years, against the target figure set by the world bank of 3.9 billion dollars for what belgrade would need for the three-year period. this pledge is in addition to the pledges of individual eu member states that will be made separately at the conference, said gunnar wiegand, spokesman for external affairs commissioner chris patten. infrastructure, including power, water, rail and roads, he said, were suffering from many years of decay, mismanagement and the consequences of the nato 1999 bombing campaign that ended belgrade's repression of kosovo's ethnic albanian majority. a yugoslavia that has a firm and decisive program of economic reforms in place is and is increasingly integrated into the wider international community is no longer a dream, it is now a reality. in berlin, bodo hombach, coordinator of the balkans stability pact, said several delegations to the brussels conference told him it was now easier and more motivating to supply belgrade with the aid it desperately needs.
