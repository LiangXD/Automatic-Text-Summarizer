new delhi, april 22 -- international call charges have finally started tumbling down, with bharti telesonic ltd -- the long-distance arm of the bharti group offering tariffs that are up to 40 percent lower than the existing rates. announcing this at a news conference, mr sunil mittal, chairman &amp amp managing director, bharti enterprises, noted that the tariffs, which would be made available on its ild [international long distance] services being launched on may 1, would be revised downwards as and when the market demanded it. as per the tariff plan announced by bharti, peak-time call charges to the saarc [south asian association for regional cooperation] region will be offered at rs 21.18 per minute as against the present rs 21.82, while for the rest of the world it will be rs 24 per minute as against rs 31.30 to rs 40 that are applicable now. mr mittal noted that although the original plan was to launch the ild services (indiaone) by the middle of this month, the company was still awaiting security clearances and the commissioning certificate from the department of telecommunications (dot). bharti, after requisite clearances, will offer its network to all carriers on a non-discriminatory basis. carriers will now connect to bharti's network and enjoy rates that will enable them to offer deep discounts to the end-consumer. the multiservices platform comprises tdm [time division multiplexing] switch layer, an atm [asynchronous transfer mode] and ip layer and intelligent network to offer value-added services, he said.
