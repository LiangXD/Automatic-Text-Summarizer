one hundred and forty-four is the number, so far, of prisoners captured in the 100 days of the afghanistan war, and taken here from kandahar air base on a 27-hour flight, blindfolded, gagged, tied up, and dosed up with sedatives on the c17 cargo planes belonging to the stars and stripes air force. the government has 30 million dollars ready to build in guantanamo ('gitmo' to generations and generations of marines) nine top-security prisons just for them: but up until then it will keep them in the cages. because they are prisoners, admittedly, but in the view of the americans they do not have the status of prisoners of war, and the geneva convention is not valid for them: they are unlawful combatants, and we are not running a recreational center. the bbc has been posing questions about those photos which are stirring up protests, and many people believe them to be a scandal : photos taken in part at the landing of the c17s after the trip from afghanistan, which already showed the prisoners reduced to objects, with gags, masked goggles, and ear muffs. four envoys from the red cross arrived saturday, and will talk with the prisoners. the status of prisoners of war (which, by law, ought not to be decided on by rumsfeld, but by a tribunal) would protect them from interrogation, and would guarantee that they get a trial, by court martial, that was much fairer than that of the secret special tribunals which bush is trying to set up. it is a clash of civilizations, and it is perhaps about to become the first global prison in the new world: yesterday stockholm announced that in a cage of guantanamo there is a swedish citizen, while the next ones due to arrive are six algerians, who have nothing to do with the war in afghanistan, and who were arrested in bosnia on a tip-off from the us secret services, because they are suspected of preparing an attack against the us embassy in sarajevo (one of them is said to have phoned a member of al-qa'ida).
