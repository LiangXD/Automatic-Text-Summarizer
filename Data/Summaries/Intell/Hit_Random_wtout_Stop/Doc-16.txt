martin wolk seattle 1996-08-19 the internet browser wars heated up monday as market leader netscape communications corp launched its latest navigator software and officials of rival microsoft corp. said they saw little new. netscape , countering microsoft's high-profile launch of its internet explorer 3.0 last week , said it had linked up with more than 20 content providers , including the new york times and sportsline usa , to offer tailored news and information to users. microsoft last week made a similar offer , saying that users who download its new browser would get free trial subscriptions to the wall street journal interactive edition , espn sportszone and other services. while netscape has a commanding lead in the growing browser market , with a share estimated at over 80 percent , industry analysts say microsoft's latest software poses a threat to that dominance. _ i_ 'd say at the very minimum microsoft has leveled the playing field , and the real battle can now begin , _ said adam schoenfeld of the jupiter communications research firm. in launching the latest version of navigator , mountain view , calif.-based netscape highlighted a new electronic mail feature that will deliver information from selected content providers directly to the user's computer _ in box. _ the new software also offers enhanced audio , video and three-dimensional animation. while navigator is available for a variety of computer platforms , the new version of internet explorer so_far requires microsoft's most recent operating systems , windows 95 or windows nt. the new browser will be integrated into the windows operating system , allowing users to _ browse _ through their local computer as_well_as the internet. _ netscape does_ n't own the operating system , so it will be very difficult for them to counter that , _ said michael wallace of ubs securities.
