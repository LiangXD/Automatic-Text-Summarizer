china slams us arms sales to taiwan author: afp [ thursday, april 11, 2002 3:21:26 pm ] beijing: china on thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the united states and taiwan, demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to us weapons sales. the continual sale of arms by the united states or upgrading of relations with taiwan will only lead to tensions across the straits, foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said. the taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive issue at the core of sino-us relations, she said at the biweekly ministry briefing. the visit, if beijing allows it, is widely expected to be centered on china's dissatisfaction over the taiwan issue. beijing has also long refused to establish diplomatic relations with any nation that maintains official contact with taiwan, although it has encouraged economic exchanges between taiwan and all nations. chinese missile tests over taiwan in 1996 resulted in washington deploying two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region.
