fumiko fujisaki tokyo 1997-03-31 japan's beleaguered banks got a break on monday when the stock market ended the financial year above a key level , helping them avoid losses on their large share portfolios from pushing them into the red. some market watchers said government-backed money appeared to be behind the scenes in helping the late market rally. _ it was important to keep the nikkei above 18,000 to keep japanese financial institutions slightly above water , _ said a foreign stock broker. the close on monday was hardly great news for japan , representing a fall of 16 percent from the beginning of the fiscal year. but it was still a healthy rise from the level of 17,303.65 on january 10 when fears mounted that sharp stock price falls may force japanese banks to postpone their problem loan write-offs or post losses. second-most vulnerable is the long-term credit bank of japan ltd , which is estimated to post shareholding losses when the nikkei falls to 17,600 or below. yukiko ohara , analyst at ubs securities ltd , said she expects some big banks to unveil drastic problem loan disposal plans in 1997/98 as japan will introduce new capital adequacy standards , known as the prompt corrective action ( pca ) system , in april next year. according_to the finance ministry , japan's deposit-taking financial institutions had 29 trillion yen ( $233 billion ) worth of problem loans at the end of last september.
