beijing: china played down sensitive differences with the united states over taiwan on thursday, with president jiang zemin holding his tongue over us commitments to arm the diplomatically-isolated island. jiang portrayed talks with us president george w. bush on the issue as low-key, telling reporters both sides had expressed opposition to 'taiwan independence' and the hope of solving the taiwan question peacefully. jiang's subdued tone, despite us pledges to press on with arms sales to taipei and a defence summit with taiwan officials next month, underlined his desire to avoid disputes with washington ahead of a leadership handover this autumn. jiang said bush had restated washington's long-standing commitment to beijing's one china policy, which states that taiwan and the mainland belong to a single country. we believe in peaceful settlement of this issue, bush told a news conference after talks with jiang on the first day of his visit. the united states passed the taiwan relations act in the same year as it switched diplomatic relations from taipei to beijing in 1979, reaffirming its commitment to taiwan and pledging to maintain arms sales to the island. in another controversial move, the us defence department said on wednesday it would take part in a closed-door conference next month that private organisers call a defence summit with taiwan, an event which would typically anger china.
