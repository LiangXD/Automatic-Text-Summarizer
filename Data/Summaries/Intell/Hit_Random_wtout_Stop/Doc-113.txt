madrid, sept 14 (afp) -- interpol on friday released previously confidential search warrants with vital details about the life and activities of usamah bin-ladin, the main suspect in tuesday's deadly attacks in the united states. the two warrants -- from 1998 and 2000 -- were released at a press conference here by interpol president jesus espigares of spain and secretary general ronald k. noble of the united states. the 1998 warrant charged that bin-ladin, a saudi billionaire housed as a guest in afghanistan, was involved in the 1994 murder of two germans in syrte, libya. the other warrant, from april 4, 2000, was drafted at the request of the us government and includes a detailed description of the man who tops the us federal bureau of investigation's (fbi) most wanted list. espigares and noble also said that interpol has created a task force, named september 11, after the date on which two hijacked airplanes crashed into the world trade center in new york city and another hit the pentagon in washington, leaving thousands dead. interpol will meet in budapest from september 24-29, where member countries will discuss methods of bringing those responsible for the attacks to justice, espigares and noble said. but for the world, september 11 is a day that will mark the entire world, noble said.
