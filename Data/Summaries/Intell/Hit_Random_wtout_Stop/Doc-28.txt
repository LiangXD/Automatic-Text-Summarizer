eugene moosa tokyo 1997-03-31 japanese prime minister ryutaro hashimoto , moving to tackle his biggest political problem , vowed on monday to push through legislation to extend land leases for u.s. military bases beyond a may deadline. it was the first time hashimoto had formally confirmed he would submit a bill to parliament revising the land expropriation laws , an issue which has become the most pressing domestic headache for his government. the new legislation will , in effect , give the japanese government a temporary extension of its leases on land occupied by the u.s. bases after the current contracts expire. without the proposed revisions to the land laws , the government would be _ illegally _ occupying the land. private land for u.s. bases is expropriated by the japanese government , not the u.s. military itself. local authorities on okinawa , where about half of the 40,000 u.s. troops in japan are stationed , want the bases closed by 2015 but tokyo strongly opposes such a move. the social democratic party , the ldp's ally in parliament , has said it will oppose the bill , but the main opposition shinshinto ( new frontier party ) and its splinter sun party ( taiyoto ) have indicated they may support the government bill.
