it's not another ice age, but at least it's cooler as countries gear up for battles over ratifying the 1997 kyoto protocol, a recent study suggests that the world already has stepped along the path to a future cooler than it might have been. the researchers link the slower rate to implementation of the 1987 montreal protocol, in which countries agreed to phase out production of gases that erode the earth's protective ozone layer. known collectively as chlorofluorocarbons, these gases also trap heat thousands of times as effectively as carbon dioxide - the main focus of kyoto. the slowdown also is due in part to the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide, for reasons that aren't well understood and need more study, notes james hansen, the nasa researcher who conducted the study with makiko sato, also with the giss. the work grows out of a longer-term effort by the two scientists to explore paths to adjusting the globe's thermostat other than the politically charged effort embodied in the kyoto protocol. by focusing on carbon dioxide, the pact sets its sights on curbing the greenhouse gas held most responsible for contributing to the climate's warming during the past century. the duo calculates that by reducing methane emissions by 30 percent, for example, the effect on climate would be comparable to the effect from cuts in co 2 envisioned by the kyoto protocol during its first commitment period, which runs from 2008 to 2012.
