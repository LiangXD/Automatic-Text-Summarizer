camp x-ray it's not going to be a country club, said defense secretary donald rumsfeld last week, describing the new military detention camp at guantanamo bay, cuba, and nobody ever expected it would be. the 110 al-qaeda and taliban prisoners admitted to gitmo by the end of last week are, said rumsfeld, the hardest of the hard core, men who had killed dozens and dozens of people. last week a delegation from the international committee of the red cross arrived to inspect the camp and offer private recommendations on its operation. politicians and commentators in london are now clamoring that all held in gitmo must be guaranteed treatment in accordance with international law. under the geneva convention, those holding true pows are bound to release them at the end of hostilities but that is the last thing the u.s. wants to do with men who may be al-qaeda operatives. leaving the prisoners indefinitely beyond the reach of any legal regime, said the economist last week, would put america--pre-eminently a nation of laws--itself outside the law. still, things could be worse.
