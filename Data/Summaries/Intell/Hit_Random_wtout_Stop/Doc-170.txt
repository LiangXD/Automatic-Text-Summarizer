strasbourg, nov 29 (afp) -- three leading international organisations warned jointly thursday [29 november] that the international fight against terrorism should not be a pretext for the violation of human rights. while we recognize that the threat of terrorism requires specific measures, we call on all governments to refrain from any excessive steps which would violate fundamental freedoms and undermine legitimate dissent, a joint statement issued in strasbourg, geneva and warsaw said. the statement comes two days after the british house of commons passed emergency legislation allowing the detention of terrorist suspects without trial, and the killing of hundreds of taliban inmates in a prison uprising in mazar-i-sharif in northern afghanistan earlier this week. all three groups said it was essential that governments strike a balance between legitimate national security concerns and fundamental freedoms that is fully consistent with their international law commitments. these were: the right to life, freedom of expression and religion and freedom from torture, while it also urged that the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes be avoided. these were: the right to life, freedom of expression and religion and freedom from torture, while it also urged that the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes be avoided. the united states earlier this week hinted it may expand its war against terrorism beyond afghanistan to iraq, bringing swift criticism from both germany and france, who called for restraint in the future of the military campaign.
