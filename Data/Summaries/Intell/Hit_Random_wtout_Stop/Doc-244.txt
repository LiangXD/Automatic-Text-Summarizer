's big defense and automotive electronics unit, gm hughes electronics, said net income fell 22% in the third quarter, reflecting declining military spending and slumping gm vehicle production. gm class h, which represents a dividend interest in hughes earnings, closed at $29, up 25 cents in big board composite trading. gm class e, which represents a dividend interest in eds profit, fell 75 cents to $52.25 on the big board. the earnings drop at gm hughes electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of hughes aircraft co. and gm's north american automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the delco electronics corp. side of the gm hughes unit. profit at the unit fell to $110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $24 million one-time charge associated with hughes's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end. gmac said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35% in the u.s., largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales. the company has said it wants to boost non-gm revenue to at least 50% of its total business by the end of 1990.
