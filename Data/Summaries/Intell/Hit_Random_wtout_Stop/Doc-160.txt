it will discuss the bills on euthanasia and palliative care that the senate approved in the autumn of 2001. the criticisms mainly focus on the applicability of the senate's bill, the lack of a palliative filter prior to committing euthanasia, the supervisory role of the assessment committee, which is likely to be understaffed, and the nonexistence of fixed penalties for unjustifiable cases of euthanasia. the chamber will treat the bill differently than the senate, which worked with a joint justice and public health committee. yesterday [8 january], this committee initiated a hearing on palliative care. deputy fred erdman has drafted his own bill regarding the problems connected with terminating one's life and the condition of terminally ill patients. vld floor leader hugo coveliers and party member maggie de block also have a bill on euthanasia. a resolution proposed by yolande avondroodt (vld) requesting working out a palliative care plan according to a patient's needs is based on this bill.
