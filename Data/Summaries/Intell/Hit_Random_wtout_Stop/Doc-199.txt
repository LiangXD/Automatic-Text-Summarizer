that al-qa'ida terrorists and taliban fighters are not very concerned about the human suffering that they have caused is also generally known. many countries are parties to them, but the united states has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which us troops are taking part. according to witnesses, these were attacks in an area where neither al-qa'ida troops nor taliban had been observed. secretary rumsfeld's statements (on 20 november 2001) that the united states is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners, and that my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the northern alliance) also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the taliban and al-qa'ida fighters. now, nearly two months later, concern about the fate of the captive taliban and al-qa'ida fighters has further increased. the need for timely and accurate information about possible new attacks is naturally particularly great, but whether the global ban on torture can be abused on that account is another matter. presumed war criminals such as milosevic enjoy all the guarantees of a fair trial, but the taliban and al-qa'ida fighters at guantanamo will get a trial which falls far short of the basic standards of the us constitution and the treaty on civil and political rights ratified by the united states.
