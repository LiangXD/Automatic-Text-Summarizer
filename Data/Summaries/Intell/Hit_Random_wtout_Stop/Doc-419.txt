so she said, little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like i asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you. so the little girl just said, ok i'll go in there and wash the dishes. but the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that i was ok. but because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and i just don't have the money. but because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and i just don't have the money. the first school i worked at was enderly park and then it was closed down. um, that, i really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because i was there i think the first year i went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and i don't think they used that gym no more than three years.
