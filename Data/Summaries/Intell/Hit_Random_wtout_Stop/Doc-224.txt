the white house hastened to describe the bush plan as the most audacious program in american history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions. it advocates a voluntarist approach to the fight against global warming by directly linking the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction to us economic growth. for the moment mr. bush simply proposes to curb the increase in harmful gas emissions and is counting on the good will of us industrialists, who account for 36% of the greenhouse gas produced by industrialized countries (as opposed to 31.6% for europe). he asserted, in an allusion to the binding objectives of the kyoto protocol, that it would be unjust and counterproductive to condemn developing countries to weak or even nonexistant economic growth by insisting that they adopt unrealistic greenhouse gas reduction targets. developing nations such as china and india already account for a majority of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. the discontent of the environmentalists as far as the us administration is concerned, this approach will make it posible to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in the long run, while sustaining the economic growth needed to finance our investments in a new, cleaner energy structure. the white house hastened to describe the bush plan as the most audacious program in american history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions, considering that it would be possible to save the administration up to $1 billion, compared to the costs that binding rules would lead to.
