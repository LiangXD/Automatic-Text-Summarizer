during the past weeks europe and america witnessed the arrangement of important international conferences, which could on the one hand guarantee the peace and stability of the world, or could instead deteriorate the conditions. the bonn conference however, which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate, could be appraised as an exception and a relative success. jacques chirac, the french president, responding to the protests leveled by opponents of globalization, had said: they have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor... similarly, gerhard schroeder, the german chancellor, too had claimed that the participants at the summit meeting were the true, legitimate, and elected representatives of the people of their countries. in the remarks made by these political leaders, one point is interesting and calls for reflection: if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations, while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them, then it must be said that they are only the elected [leaders] of their own nation [people], and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide! [exclamation mark as published] in view of the criticisms, which have been made, they could perhaps be also considered to be the representative of powerful corporations that have placed the whole world economy under their influence, and as a result of that they are also controlling the world of politics globally. to recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of new york and genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely.
