caracas (afp) -- the venezuelan military high command maintains its support for president hugo chavez despite calls from the opposition to take part in an indefinite general strike declared wednesday night [10 april], and despite the individual acts of insubordination of two generals on that same day, one of them in command of no troops. however, the high military commands supported the government during the emergency caused by the strike staged by the trade union and business association opposition, a strike that was extended indefinitely on wednesday night, according to carlos ortega, president of the venezuelan workers confederation (ctv), the largest labor confederation in the country. however, datanalisis analyst leon indicated that even though chavez still controls the military forces at the present time, this fact constitutes no permanent life insurance, since the current indefinite general strike called by the opposition ctv and the fedecamaras [venezuelan federation of associations and chambers of commerce and industry] leadership is only one battle in a war that he predicts will be a long one. the analyst observed that venezuela is now radicalized between an inept, abusive and authoritarian government and a neutralized, heterogeneous, impatient and politically immature opposition. leon added that the opposition has viewed the pdvsa conflict as the perfect lifesaver for reviving civilian social pressure for chavez' ouster from power, this following a cooling of such pressure in recent days. the analyst noted that although there is growing unrest in the streets, the opposition's hope of the immediate exit of the chief of state looks presumptuous. leon visualizes two scenarios: in the first, tension will increase in the days ahead, but not destabilize the government, then dwindle toward the end of the week and generate frustration among the opposition over not achieving its objective, a factor that would in turn strengthen chavez.
