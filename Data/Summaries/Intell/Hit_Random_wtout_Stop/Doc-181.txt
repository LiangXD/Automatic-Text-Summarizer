prof. shapiro says the molecular computer is the first of its kind. previous biological computers were the same size as the room in which the supervisors and computer equipment worked, said shapiro. professor shapiro and a growing number of other scientists believe dna-based computers may lead to a number of useful applications -- they could be planted inside cells, where they would watch for irregularities or even synthesize drugs. let's say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a b dna type appears in a dna section is odd or even. the dna section -- the input -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer's hardware. once the computer has dissected the entire input, it can determine whether the sequence appeared an even or odd number of times according to the last label -- the output. the computer can also do other calculations, such as checking whether the b sequence appears at least once, or at most once, by inserting different types of software dnas.
