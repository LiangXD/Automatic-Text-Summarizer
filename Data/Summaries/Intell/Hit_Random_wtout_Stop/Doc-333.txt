new argentine president quits after a week march vote nixed buenos aires - argentina ended 2001 leaderless and penniless yesterday with its new interim president resigning a week into the job and the country fearing more bloodshed and the loss of savings frozen in the banks. plunged into chaos by looting and deadly riots that forced fernando de la rua to resign as president a week ago, argentina fell deeper into anarchy when interim leader adolfo rodriguez saa quit on sunday after losing his party's support. 'shameful' ordinary argentines have been pouring into the streets night after hot summer night, banging pots and pans demanding, and eventually receiving, the resignation of de la rua, his unpopular economy minister and aides to rodriguez saa who were suspected of corruption. with new year celebrations canceled for fear of violence in the worst crisis since the country's last military coup in 1976, security chief juan jose alvarez said the capital had been strongly reinforced with patrols by the federal police, the coast guard and the border police. but despite the heavy guard on the president's pink palace and the plaza de mayo outside, there were no rumblings of intervention by the military which has been subordinate to civilian rule since 1983. while the moratorium on part of argentina's $132-billion public debt, heralding the biggest default in history, had long been expected by markets that have dumped argentine bonds this year, rodriguez saa's plans for a new currency caused alarm. u.s. president george w. bush said yesterday he was worried about argentina, but was confident the country would stay together until it chooses a new leader while offering help once things stabilized.
