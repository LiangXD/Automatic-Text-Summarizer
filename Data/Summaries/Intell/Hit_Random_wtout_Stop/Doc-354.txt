veni, vidi, venezuela fighting tyranny with tyranny clearly didn't work in oil-giant venezuela last week. and now coup-plotting military officers and the reinstalled president, hugo chavez, need to show latin america that their tyrannical tactics are at an end. president chavez - a former army coup-meister himself, who was elected three years ago - has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures based on a constitution largely rewritten by himself and his supporters. but latin america has moved beyond coups, and this pivotal nation in a hemisphere of democracies has the means to remove mr. chavez by constitutional and especially nonviolent means. his two-day removal from office began when he tried to stack the board of the state-owned oil company in his favor. when gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace last thursday, killing more than a dozen, military leaders forced chavez to step aside. but then international pressure and renewed domestic support for chavez forced the generals to let him take office again.
