mbeki, obasanjo envoys in fresh bid to save mugabe staff reporter 3/28/02 1:22:20 am (gmt +2) african superpowers south africa and nigeria this week stepped up efforts to broker a comprise between zimbabwe's ruling zanu pf party and the opposition movement for democratic change (mdc) to ward off the crisis of illegitimacy facing controversially elected president robert mugabe's new administration. presidents thabo mbeki and olusegun obasanjo, sensing outright isolation of mugabe and the refusal by many zimbabweans and the west to recognise his win, have dispatched african national congress secretary-general kgalema motlanthe and prominent west african diplomat adebayo adedeji to try to hammer a compromise between zanu pf and the mdc. mbeki and obasanjo have given the duo three weeks to come up with a solution that will help bridge the rift between the two political parties and arrest the deteriorating political and economic crisis in the country. according to sources, the two zimbabwean political parties were asked to draw up agendas for talks as the first step to finding a compromise to the current crisis. diplomatic sources say african leaders are frantically making efforts to bring the mdc on board through the formation of a coalition government in order to facilitate recognition of the zimbabwean government by the international community and unlock much-needed foreign aid that has been suspended. the mdc has said it wants fresh elections conducted under international supervision by the united nations within the shortest possible period. the sources said the formation of a coalition government being pushed by mbeki and obasanjo was the most ideal way to stave off international isolation of zimbabwe but has been received with mixed feelings by the governing party.
