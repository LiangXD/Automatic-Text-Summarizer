international economic talks between china and the association of southeast asian nations (asean) about a free trade area went smoothly, senior officials said yesterday. but the official declined to disclose details about their two-day negotiations, saying these are just working level talks and more substantial progress will be made at the china and asean economic ministers' meeting in september. the third china-asean economic senior official's meeting, held in beijing on tuesday, set up a trade negotiation committee to hold in-depth discussions on the framework of a free trade area in the region. the committee said in a joint statement at the end of the meeting that it will try to have the framework finalized at the china-asean summit in cambodia at the end of this year. chinese and asean officials said the decision by chinese and asean leaders to establish a free trade area is a historic milestone in economic co-operation between china and asean and demonstrates strong commitments by china-asean leaders to regional integration and economic globalization as they pursue peace and stability and prosperity in the region. a study by chinese and asean experts shows china's export to asean will increase 55.1 per cent to us$10.6 billion and asean's export to china will increase 48 per cent to us$13 billion after the establishment of the free trade area. china east asia china southeast asia china thailand philippines burma indonesia
