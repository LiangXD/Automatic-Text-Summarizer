angela tan singapore 1997-03-31 sembawang corp ltd ( sembcorp ) and jurong shipyard ltd said on monday they had completed negotiations on a proposed merger to create one of the world's largest shiprepair firms. _ our aim is to combine our market share and knock out the competition permanently , _ said chairman of sembcorp , philip yeo at a news conference. _ the merger will be our answer to the direct competition from the middle east. _ combined , they have slightly more than 50 percent of the singapore market and will have a total of nine dry docks , including three very large crude carrier-sized docks , yeo said. under the revised proposal , sembcorp will inject only its shipyard businesses , excluding some parts like its loss-making offshore engineering operations. jurong will issue 27.6 million new shares to sembcorp at s$6.80 each for the assets to be injected. the offshore engineering assets were excluded because sembcorp's strategy and focus were different from jurong's , a joint statement said. the merger will result in sembcorp's stake in jurong rising to 38.6 percent from 23.4 percent and will trigger a mandatory general offer for the rest of jurong shares. _ our aim is to get as much as we can and leave enough shares in the public for trading , _ yeo said when asked how many jurong shares sembcorp was interested in acquiring. it places the merged entity in a better position to take full advantage of the next upturn when it occurs. _ analysts told reuters the revised deal was much fairer for jurong with the exclusion of sembcorp's loss-making offshore engineering operations. sembcorp shares ended down s$0.45 at s$6.95 on monday. $-- singapore newsroom ( 65 8703083 )
