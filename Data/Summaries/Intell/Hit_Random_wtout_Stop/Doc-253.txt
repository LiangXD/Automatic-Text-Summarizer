and defense lawyers are warning that they won't stick around if they don't get paid. the issue has come to a boil in newark, n.j., where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for eddie antar that if the founder and former chairman of crazy eddie inc. is indicted, the government may move to seize the money that mr. antar is using to pay legal fees. in those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment. in a letter, prosecutors told mr. antar's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized. according to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made. still, criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their sixth amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers' fees. they also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid.
