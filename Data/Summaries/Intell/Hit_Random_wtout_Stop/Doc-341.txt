africa's grand bargain all was not lost in zimbabwe's rigged election last week. africa's two richest and most powerful nations, south africa and nigeria, decided to punish zimbabwe on tuesday for a flawed presidential vote. this grand bargain to uplift the world's poorest continent would have been in jeopardy if thabo mbeki, south africa's president, and olusegun obasanjo, nigeria's president, had not agreed to suspend zimbabwe from the 54-nation group of former british colonies known as the commonwealth. the grand pact, known as the new partnership for africa's development, was initiated by the two leaders. mbeki and other african leaders need to press mr. mugabe to stop his repression and to not take farmland from whites without just compensation. but now that he's cornered by the international community with many types of isolation - including opprobrium from two of his african peers - he has lashed out by charging opposition leader morgan tsvangirai with trying to kill him. south africa's leader, mbeki, who has been inclined toward quiet diplomacy with zimbabwe, has now made himself heard.
