violent protests in argentina president duhalde calls for calm buenos aires - president eduardo duhalde yesterday pleaded for patience as he works on the country's economic crisis. at least 13 people were reported injured in the overnight clashes outside the government palace, known as the casa rosada, and dozens of people reportedly were detained. duhalde, who took office on january 2 as argentina's fifth president in a month, vowed his government would unveil a new economic program to rescue the country from four years of recession. daily protests have engulfed argentina: popular rage has boiled over against duhalde's decision to devalue the peso by more than 30 percent and further tighten a banking freeze that has locked most argentines' savings into bank accounts. the beleaguered president made no mention of the widely despised banking freeze that has presented a nettlesome challenge to his three-week-old administration: how to give argentines their savings back without prompting an all-out collapse of the financial system. but after the devaluation of the peso, many banks say they simply don't have the money to return to depositors. get out! people chanted, venting their anger at duhalde's government. artwriter(hight): objectsubheader(position): objectheader(hlayer1): objectarttitle(hlang): --> if (document.layers) document.write( ) --> @ copyright 2002 ha'aretz.
