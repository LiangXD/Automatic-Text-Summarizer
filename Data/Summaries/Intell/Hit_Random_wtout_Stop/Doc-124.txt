colombo, sept 16 (afp) - tamil tiger rebels launched a flotilla of boats to attack a ferry carrying 1,200 troops in northern sri lanka sunday, hours after an explosive-laden boat tried to ram a navy gunboat in a suicide mission, the defence ministry said. he said navy gunboats and helicopter gunships repulsed the initial attack and first reports indicated at least two rebel craft had been blown out of the water. hours before the ferry incident, a navy fast attack craft encountered an explosive-laden boat which blew up in an apparent tamil tiger suicide mission, karunaratne said. tiger guerrillas, leading a campaign for an independent homeland in the island's northeast, have carried out several attacks against navy and merchant ships, including using boats carrying suicide bombers on more than a dozen naval craft. in september 1999, the sri lankan navy fought tiger rebel boats off the island's northeastern coast to prevent the guerrillas from seizing a chinese merchant vessel. a tiger flotilla had been moving towards the 14,000-tonne mv yugi when it was confronted by navy gun boats, the defence ministry said at the time, adding that the 32 crew members had not been hurt. government forces as well as civilians depend on a vital sea route to jaffna to provide them with supplies since the land route is held by the tiger rebels.
