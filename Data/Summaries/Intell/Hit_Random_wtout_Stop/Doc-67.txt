lawrence sheets tbilisi 1997-03-31 georgian president eduard shevardnadze on monday hailed a decision by the commonwealth of independent states to extend russia's peacekeeping role in breakaway abkhazia , but separatists there poured scorn on it. the 2,500 russian peacekeepers are to be given policing powers to help guarantee the safety of returning georgian refugees , most of whom fled following a 1993 separatist takeover after abkhaz irregulars drove out the georgian army. shevardnadze had said last week that the peacekeepers would have to leave if russia did not give georgia , devastated by civil and ethnic conflict since it became independent in 1991 , more help in restoring control over abkhazia. many georgian politicians want the peacekeepers to go and also demand that russia leave three military bases it still has in the southern caucasus state of about six million people. he said abkhazia might insist that the contingent is removed entirely and that he did not fear a new georgian offensive. _ the armed forces of the republic are capable of independently guaranteeing it_ 's security , _ he told interfax. tension between the minority abkhaz and local georgians , who once made up nearly half the pre-war population of 550,000 , spilled into bloodshed in 1992 when rag-tag georgian military outfits stormed in to put down demands for more sovereignty. local armenians and other ethnic groups in abkhazia generally supported the abkhaz in the conflict , when minorities feared what they called a wave of nationalism in georgia.
