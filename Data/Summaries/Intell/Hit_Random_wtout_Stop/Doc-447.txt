dear friends of pleasant run: the holiday season is the time of year when we're all busy buying gifts, baking goodies, decorating our homes and making arrangements to be with family and friends. others are from families that are struggling to provide a healthy, happy environment but don't have the resources to make it possible. it may help a family stay together. a gift to pleasant run means the children in our care will have presents to open. a gift means a family will have a holiday meal, cooking utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on. it can help purchase clothing, school supplies, books and educational tools throughout the year. we wish you and your family a new year full of joy and love.
