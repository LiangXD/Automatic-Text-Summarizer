and therefore, it has blatantly obstructed all international, us, european, and regional efforts to consolidate an israeli-palestinian ceasefire as a prerequisite for the implementation of the mitchell and tenet recommendations. the us expects its friends to provide it with understanding, cooperation and full support in confronting the perpetrators of the devastating attack on its centres of economic and military power. but instead of reciprocating, israel, the state that since its creation has benefited most from us protection and backing, has turned out to be a fair-weather friend. sharon's likening of his invasion of palestinian territories and the assassinations to the us-led war against the taleban and osama ben laden is abhorrent. sharon's deceptive ploys cannot negate the fact that president yasser arafat and the palestinian national authority have and are still, even while under attack, doing their utmost to demonstrate their unambiguous commitment to stop violence, maintain the ceasefire, and get back to negotiations. the calls from washington and london for the just and legitimate realisation of palestinian statehood as part of such a settlement, should be viewed by the israeli leadership as a guarantee of israel's peace and security, but continued violence and aggression, as history has shown time and again, is a recipe for disaster. the calls from washington and london for the just and legitimate realisation of palestinian statehood as part of such a settlement, should be viewed by the israeli leadership as a guarantee of israel's peace and security, but continued violence and aggression, as history has shown time and again, is a recipe for disaster.
