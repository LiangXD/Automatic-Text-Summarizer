durban march 19 sapa sa observer: zim elections not free and fair another member of the south african observer mission to zimbabwe says the past weekend's presidential election in the southern african country was not free and fair. bam on sunday said she believed zimbabwe's election was not free and fair, adding they were not in line with international standards as well as those of her organisation. in a preliminary, motsuenyane declared the zimbabwe poll legitimate , adding they could, however, not be openly described as free and fair. under these circumstances nobody can feel free. saom on monday stopped short of declaring the zimbabwean presidential election free and fair, but the african national congress majority on the committee declared the poll credible. the inkatha freedom party, democratic alliance, new national party, african christian democratic party, the pan africanist congress and the united christian democratic party had disagreed with the anc conclusion. the united states, britain, local zimbabwean observers, and the commonwealth observer team also described the poll as not free and fair.
