sao paulo 1997-03-31 double world champion michael schumacher learned on sunday that his season was again going to be a struggle $-- thanks_to the formula one tyre war. the german ferrari driver struggled to finish fifth behind the victorious jacques villeneuve in the brazilian grand_prix , second race of the year. on sunday his warnings proved to be correct. although villeneuve dominated the twice-started race in his goodyear-shod williams , it was the performances of panis , in a bridgestone-tyred prost , and hill , in his much improved arrows using bridgestone rubber , which were most notable. team manager john walton said : _ i think we could have gone the distance with these tyres and scored a good finish if it had not been for other problems. _ villeneuve's victory , however , proved that the canadian had the ability to produce strong racing even when things were tough and he was not running on the best tyres. but it was a bad day for his new team mate , german heinz-harald frentzen , who finished ninth. _ he had a_lot_of problems this weekend and we need to sit down and sort them out , _ williams team technical director patrick head said. _ there is some talking to be done. _ given hill's strong showing , the williams team may be wondering if they made the right decision in dropping the world champion last year and bringing in the relatively inexperienced frentzen to replace him. frentzen clearly needs to produce a top-level performance for the third round of the series in argentina on april 13 if he is to secure his future with the defending constructors' champions $-- and improved tyres from goodyear would certainly help.
