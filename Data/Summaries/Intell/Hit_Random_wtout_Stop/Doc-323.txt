president unleashes army, rocket launchers, mig-21s subhead: rumblings of rebellion: opposition aghast at 'state terrorism' author: jan cienski harare, zimbabwe - elements of zimbabwe's army began leaving their barracks yesterday in an ominous sign that robert mugabe intends to rig this weekend's presidential election and is preparing for a fight if the opposition challenges him. three mig-21 fighters flew low over farmland in mashonaland west in an apparent intimidatory display meant to underline the threat being spread by ruling party thugs: if president robert mugabe loses the election, we will go to war. observers and the opposition worry mr. mugabe, the country's only president in 22 years of independence, is becoming increasingly reckless in his attempt to hold on to power. already, his ruling zimbabwean african national unity-patriotic front party has moved to disenfranchise thousands of supporters of the opposition movement for democratic change. much of the country's tiny white minority has been disenfranchised and mr. mugabe issued a decree, earlier ruled illegal by the supreme court, which forces people to vote in their home districts. the mdc says as many as 34 of its supporters have been killed since the presidential campaign began in january and fears are rising there will be an explosion of violence next week, no matter what the result of the election. one of the country's state-owned newspapers carried a front-page story yesterday claiming britain and the united states were preparing to support military insurgency in zimbabwe.
