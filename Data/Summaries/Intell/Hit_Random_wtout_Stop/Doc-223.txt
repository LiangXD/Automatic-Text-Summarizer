but the eu is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce us emissions. while the intensity improvements may reduce this to around 33%, this is still a very substantial increase in absolute emissions. it is striking that the approach which is considered beneficial for other air pollutants, namely to implement cap-and-trade programmes, is not extended to co2 emissions from the power sector. the eu is of the opinion that a cap-and-trade system is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions which combines a guaranteed environmental result with the flexibility to reduce emissions where it is least costly. the eu welcomes the fact that the bush administration has now completed its policy review and has put forward what the us intends to do in terms of domestic climate change policy. the eu is determined to proceed with ratification of the kyoto protocol by june 2002 in view of entry into force by the time of the world summit on sustainable development. the eu will continue on its current path of emission reduction and is optimistic that other major players, notably japan and russia, will join us in these efforts.
