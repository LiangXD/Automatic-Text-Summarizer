the annual human rights report of the us state department has been strongly criticized and condemned by many countries. many countries in asia, europe, africa, and latin america have rejected the content of the us human rights report, calling it a brazen distortion of the situation, a wrongful and illegitimate move, and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries. the united states has been preparing annual reports on human rights in 190 countries for 25 years while ignoring the real situation at home. this year, the us report devotes many pages to commenting on human rights in the democratic people's republic of korea and iraq. in light of the united states' malicious goals, its annual human rights report for 2001 is facing strong protest and criticism from the world. the washington times last weekend carried an article by andrew welsdan, a representative of the us fund for reconciliation and development, rejecting the report's allegation of human rights in vietnam. the annual human rights report released by the us state department is not convincing as it is inaccurate and fabricated.
