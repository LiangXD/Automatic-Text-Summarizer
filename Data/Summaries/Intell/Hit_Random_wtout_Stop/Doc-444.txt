july 25,1997 dear name, what a summer! i hope you'll consider continuing your support of jameson's special campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx. all of our six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity (and, truth be told, with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed in) and we have a waiting list of 60 children who are hoping to come if a spot should open. it seems summer options aren't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes, so we're doing all we can to make jameson available. these 60 or so campers have takenon a fund raiser with a goal of raising $16,000 for camperships. even after the summer sessions come to a close, jameson campers will take part in year-round programs designed to keep that positive contact with peers and role models alive and important. we've scheduled more than 15 follow-up camper weekends beginning in september and going around till next summers camping season.
