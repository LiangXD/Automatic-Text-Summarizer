at a japan-us summit meeting on 18 february, prime minister junichiro koizumi expressed some understanding of us president george w. bush's remarks that iran, iraq, and the dprk (north korea) are an axis of evil. this left the impression that japan stands alone on this issue because european countries have been cool to bush's axis of evil rhetoric. however, it will be difficult for japan to provide support to the us, as it did when the us attacked afghanistan, if us forces launch military action against iraq. at a meeting of several officials held at the outset of the summit, the president first took up economic issues and then referred to his axis of evil remark. it is possible that if the us military attack iraq, japan, which has shown understanding of the axis of evil remark, will be asked to provide active support to the us as it did during us attacks on afghanistan. however, it will be difficult for the self-defense forces to provide logistic support to us forces attacking iraq under a special antiterrorism law aimed at eradicating terrorism, which was enacted after terrorist attacks in the us on 11 september. if japan does not give any support to possible us attacks on iraq despite its understanding of the axis of evil rhetoric, bush's expectations on the koizumi administration will certainly change to disappointment.
