david lawder detroit 1997-03-31 continuing at a steady but unspectacular pace , u.s. car and truck sales for march are expected to show gains for japanese and german automakers at the expense of detroit's big three , analysts said monday. both chrysler corp. and ford motor co. are expected to report march sales declines of about 3 percent , compared with a year ago , while general motors corp. may post gains of 3 percent to 6 percent over last year's strike-affected results. chrysler plans to report sales on tuesday , with gm following wednesday and ford on thursday. this year's market is very competitive , _ said schroder wertheim analyst john casesa. _ the march numbers are going to show that the market is not as robust as the annual rate suggests. _ analysts estimate that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for march light vehicle sales will be about 15 million to 15.4 million units , compared with 15.5 million a year ago. as the year drags on , automakers will probably have to fork over increasingly higher incentives to maintain sales rates above 15 million , casesa said. ford division general manager ross roberts on thursday confirmed that ford is adding new dealer incentives. gm shares closed off 75 cents at $55.375 , ford rose 50 cents to $31.375 , and chrysler slid 25 cents to $30 , all on the new york stock exchange.
