diesel engine manufacturers have long maintained that these are harmless , but recently they have been found to contain polyaromatich hydrocarbons ( pah ) , which can cause cancer when breathed deeply. diesel engines also produce nitrous ocxides ( nox ) , which return from the skies as acid rain. while many politicians have only recently seen their green light many diesel engine manufacturers have looked further ahead , and have been developing cleaner engines , principally in response to stringent american legislation. while the first level of cuts can be reached using existing levels of technology , the second stage , likely in 1994 , will require a new generation of engines. these will be electronically controlled , a technical task far harder on a diesel engine than on its petrol counterpart. for there to be a europe-wide common standard of emissions , there must also be a common standard for fuel , as some types of fuel smoke worse than others. unlike lead , which the fuel companies eventually proved only too pleased to take out_of petrol , sulphur does nothing for either the performance or longevity of diesel engines and it contributes to acid rain.
