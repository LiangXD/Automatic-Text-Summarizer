state visit: the us president is getting good reviews from political experts for refusing to restate the 'three nos' and declining to endorse peaceful reunification as us president george w. bush wrapped up his six-day visit to asia yesterday, analysts gave their thumbs up to his determination to voice his firm support for taiwan despite pressure from china to do otherwise. while past trips to china by us presidents have produced agreements or statements that have damaged taiwan's interests, bush's visit only enhanced the nation's confidence in his administration, cheng said. former us president bill clinton agitated taiwan when he gave the so-called three nos speech during his visit to china in 1998. bush described taiwan as a good friend of the us during his weekly radio address to the us public that aired last week within hours of his departure for asia. china has tried to highlight and accentuate the taiwan issue during bush's trip to china, but the us agenda rested instead on anti-terrorism and china's proliferation of arms sale to countries like iran and pakistan, chang argued. the us' rising concerns over china's military expansion and its appreciation for taipei's support for the us-led war against terrorism drove bush to stand firm in his support for taiwan, the dpp legislator said. fresh from his trip to washington, where us government officials highlighted taiwan's contribution to the war against terrorism, chang said, even as a small country, we stood with the us at that critical moment, and the us appreciated that and has reciprocated what we've done.
