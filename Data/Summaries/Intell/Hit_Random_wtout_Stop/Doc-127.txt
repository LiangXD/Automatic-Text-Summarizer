military violence constitutes -- in very exceptional circumstances -- a necessary evil in this very imperfect world. without armed violence the nazi regime and similar forces that had the wind in their sails in europe in the 1930s, would not have fallen. in the battle against the new forms of terrorism that reached a tragic culmination on 11 september, a limited form of military violence could also not be ruled out. the many and often confusing reports we have received over recent weeks on who may be responsible for the attacks already allows a clear pattern to be detected. the network with which usama bin ladin and his followers tried to destroy the very foundations of the west has ramifications worldwide, vast amounts of money, and thanks to the taliban regime in afghanistan also a number of excellent training and attack bases. they took pains to build a broad coalition, and tried to make it clear to their own population and the international community that the enemy is not islam but a very well defined and perverse interpretation of this religion. the economic impact of the 11 september attacks was already disastrous, with clear effects on the world economy, hitting the poorest countries by far the most.
