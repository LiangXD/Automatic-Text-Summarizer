foreign firms furiously lobby in argentina buenos aires -- foreign multinational companies trying to avoid billions in losses furiously lobbied argentine lawmakers and the new government ahead of today's final vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the u.s. dollar. it attracted much foreign investment in the 1990s because companies were promised that their profits in pesos would always be worth the same in dollars. but the rock-solid link between the peso and dollar made argentine exports overpriced abroad and manufacturers moved next door to brazil, where it is half as expensive to operate. if the argentine peso is also devalued about 30 percent, as is expected, a car loan of $10,000 would be worth about $7,000. they want the dollar value of debt to remain constant, no matter what the devaluation of the peso. foreign companies that took over former state transportation, phone and energy companies want -- but appear unlikely to get -- some form of indexing so they can raise their prices to compensate for what is expected to be a widening gap between the peso and dollar. foreign companies that took over former state transportation, phone and energy companies want -- but appear unlikely to get -- some form of indexing so they can raise their prices to compensate for what is expected to be a widening gap between the peso and dollar.
