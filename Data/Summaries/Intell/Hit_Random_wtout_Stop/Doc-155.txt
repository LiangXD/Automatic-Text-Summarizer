the argentine tv station todo noticias [ all news ] reported yesterday that president fernando henrique cardoso on saturday night telephoned cordoba province governor jose manuel de la sota, of the justicialist party (pj) -- who once served as ambassador to brazil -- to voice his concern over incidents in the country. cardoso told de la sota that the images of the protests at the plaza de mayo show a country on the verge of a civil war, one of the channel's journalists commented. but neither itamaraty nor the planalto palace confirmed the president's phone call to the governor of cordoba. for jose agripino maia, pfl [liberal front party] leader in the senate, although brazil has detached itself from argentina, it should not disregard the message of the crises that is devastating the neighboring country. senator heloisa helena (workers party -- alagoas) said that latin american countries should always join together to speak with international economic institutions, in order to maintain autonomy in their economies: now we see what happens when one country abdicates its financial autonomy. this is viewed as the main impediment to the establishment of political order in the country. latin america is no longer important because the focus now is on global security and no longer on the international economic order.
