the un international conference on financing for development opened in monterrey on 18 march (telam photo) monterrey, mexico--choked, hushed voices, some of them astounded, are not guessing correctly about the dilemma of the chicken or the egg into which the argentine crisis has become converted, almost grotesquely: will the international monetary fund (imf) endorse concrete aid to the country, apart from the presumable good intentions of its board members and technicians, without the approval of george w. bush? the same thing is happening to the countries now. eduardo duhalde's agenda, during his first departure from the country since he assumed the presidency, calls for a key meeting on friday with the imf's managing director, horst koehler, (which he will attend accompanied by economy minister jorge remes lenicov), and two occasions on which he will have the floor, addressing the world (for five minutes on one, and three minutes on the other) concerning the topic under discussion the monterrey consensus: or greater assistance from the developed countries to those that are underdeveloped, which in fact will be approved by consensus. with 58 chief executives immersed in signing a document which, as la nacion was told by the argentine ambassador to the united nations, arnoldo listre, gives a clue to the direction in which we are heading: it shows a new organization in which the market economy is accepted as a fundamental factor for development and, unlike the cold war, is rid of the north-south confrontation. un secretary general kofi annan himself said, in his time, that the situation of indebted, undeveloped countries must be consideed, so as to avoid the repetition of a crisis such as ours. in the documents, argentina ranks in 59th place for its per capita income: $7,440, according to the world bank's report on development: a substantially devalued figure after the default and the end of the currency board arrangement. in the documents, argentina ranks in 59th place for its per capita income: $7,440, according to the world bank's report on development: a substantially devalued figure after the default and the end of the currency board arrangement.
