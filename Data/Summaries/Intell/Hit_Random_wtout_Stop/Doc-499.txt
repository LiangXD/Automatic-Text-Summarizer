c'wealth mission conduct questionable by a special correspondent - britain's prime minister, tony blair, privately did two things concerning zimbabwe during the recent retreat by commonwealth leaders in australia that raise questions about today's meeting in london by the troika of australia, nigeria and south africa. the first was that blair said he had received an interim report from the commonwealth observer mission to zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote. on the spurious grounds that the zimbabwe african national union-patriotic front (zanu-pf) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building, the commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned meikles hotel. the final straw that confirmed that australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the australian prime minister, john howard, ordered his high commissioner in harare not to attend sunday's inauguration of robert mugabe as president of zimbabwe. the final straw that confirmed that australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the australian prime minister, john howard, ordered his high commissioner in harare not to attend sunday's inauguration of robert mugabe as president of zimbabwe. the australians, in common with other white members of the commonwealth, the european union (eu), the americans, norwegians and the swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore mugabe as the head of state. the commonwealth secretary-general, don mckinnon of new zealand is also known to support his country's decision to condemn zimbabwe's presidential election.
