mission control's officials also stated that this unplanned space walk would be conducted in order to repair the malfunction, which had appeared in the docking unit during the docking of the russian progress m1-7 cargo space ship. experts believe that the 4mm gap between the ship and the station's docking unit has been caused by an object, which now prevents the tight joining of the two space vehicles. the cosmonauts will have to use the electric motor of the docking unit to manually un-dock the progress m1-7 to the distance of not more than one meter from the station. the space walk period will decrease if they successfully remove the object located in the gap between the ship and the docking unit. if the malfunction is more serious, the mission control will set the cosmonauts another mission. experts believe that the shuttle will be unable to dock the iss if the russian cargo ship is not tightly secured to the station. the cosmonauts who performed a space walk, successfully repaired the malfunction.
