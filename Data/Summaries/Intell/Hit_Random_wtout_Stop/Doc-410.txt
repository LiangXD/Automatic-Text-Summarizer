december 10, 1996 dear mailhouse donor reminder: you and i have done some important work together. we've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce. you have helped make goodwill's work possible with your previous support. when you and i help somebody find a job, one more person joins the ranks of tax payers, fewer tax dollars are spent on public assistance and businesses gain another consumer. there are a lot of barriers that keep people from working: physical and mental disabilities, history of welfare dependency and lack of education or self-esteem. everyone benefits from the work we do together. everyone benefits from the work we do together.
