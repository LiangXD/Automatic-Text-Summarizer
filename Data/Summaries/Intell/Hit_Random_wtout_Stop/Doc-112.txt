wang yi, who made a three-day working visit to thailand last week, sought to allay fears amongst allies in asia about its cross-straits ties with taiwan. wang's visit, which will also take in malaysia, singapore and indonesia, comes as pressure mounts on both sides to resume dialogue as beijing is poised to become a member of the world trade organisation next year. beijing was so worried about the tactic that chinese premier zhu rongji raised the matter in may with thai leaders during his official visit to thailand. he said the number of thai politicians visiting taiwan, especially members of parliament, was increasing at an unusual rate. we disapproved of these visits because no matter in what capacity these people travel, taiwan treats them as official visits. wang said beijing raised no objections to the so-called stop-over tactic used by taiwanese leaders as long as the visits do not generate political activities in the host country. last year there were 2.85 million taiwanese visitors in china, he said.
