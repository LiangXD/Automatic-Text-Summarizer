despite the logistical hurdle of moving at least several dozen presumably dangerous men around 8,000 miles from afghanistan, rumsfeld called cuba "the least worst place." ileana ros-lehtinen, r-miami, said she supported the idea, in part, because it would underscore the naval base's strategic importance at a time when some members of congress have urged returning the territory to cuba. the prisoners from afghanistan are not expected to arrive for weeks, and rumsfeld said there are no plans to stage military tribunals or trials at the base, which is home to about 1,100 members of the navy and marine corps. some prisoners are reportedly being held on warships in the afghan region. others are at a u.s. military compound in kandahar, afghanistan, where u.s. forces built a stockade of sorts to house them. 1999 plans at the southern command in miami, the pentagon's base for military operations in latin america and the caribbean, spokesman steve lucas said planners had pulled out blueprints from april 1999 -- when the clinton administration had briefly considered housing up to 20,000 refugees from the kosovo conflict at the base. in this instance, military sources said, the number of prisoners would be much smaller -- perhaps in the dozens -- and the logistics would focus more on security at the 45-square-mile base and less on the comfort of prisoners who are considered either members of a terrorist network or supporters of terrorists.
