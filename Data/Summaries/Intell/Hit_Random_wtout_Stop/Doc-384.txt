mugabe wins poll, amid claims of rigging harare, march 13 (afp) - zimbabwe's long-time ruler robert mugabe swept to victory wednesday in presidential elections in a vote that challenger morgan tsvangirai declared was rigged and unacceptable. police roadblocks were seen on the main roads leading to central harare, security forces were patrolling the city and six police officers were stationed outside mdc headquarters. polling stations in harare were reduced by 32 per cent in favour of an increase of voting outlets in rural areas, considered mugabe's support base. of 882,176 people registered to vote in harare province, 439,656 or 49.8 per cent actually did so during the three days of polling that began saturday and saw mile-long queues across the capital. the mdc, charging that the mugabe government had followed a deliberate strategy of impeding the urban vote, went to the high court and won an extra day of voting on monday, but polls opened several hours late, and only an additional 24,000 votes were cast. 'the election was preceded by months of government-orchestrated violence meant to intimidate voters (and) the opposition was repeatedly harassed and prevented from campaigning,' she said. even after the polls closed monday, mugabe's government kept up the pressure on the opposition by charging mdc secretary general welshman ncube with high treason, which the party dismissed as a smear tactic.
