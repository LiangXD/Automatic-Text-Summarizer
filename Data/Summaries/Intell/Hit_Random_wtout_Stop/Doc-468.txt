it is thus an illusion for these criminal administrations to imagine that they have triumphed and that they are now in a position to dictate their own conditions on this great people. most importantly, however, these criminals will have the largest illusion if they imagine that they have succeeded in liquidating the intifadah and destroying its infrastructure after having succeeded in liquidating or arresting a small or large number of the intifadah's leaders and strugglers. these criminals know this fact, as much as we, the arabs, do, because they are in direct contact with it. the conclusion to which we come is that the zionist and us administrations have aggravated the zionist entity's historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that force can break the palestinian people's will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose. contrary to the visible scene and to the illusion of sharon and bush, this zionist-us crime has confirmed that the zionist entity's historical impasse is constantly aggravating and that the arabs' recognition of this entity's right to exist is now more distant than before despite some official arab recognitions. millions of arabs, palestinians and non-palestinians alike, now have a conviction stronger than before to the effect that it is impossible to achieve coexistence with this usurping, occupying, aggressive, and racist entity. millions of arabs, palestinians and non-palestinians alike, now have a conviction stronger than before to the effect that it is impossible to achieve coexistence with this usurping, occupying, aggressive, and racist entity.
