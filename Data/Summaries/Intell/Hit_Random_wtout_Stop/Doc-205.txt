the session of the united nations framework convention for climate change held this time was to reach on an actual agreement regarding regulatory problems that have to be solved to put the kyoto protocol adopted in 1997 into force, so that the world may reduce the greenhouse effect and ecological damage, which are becoming more serious with each passing day, protect human lives and health, and provide favorable conditions for the promotion of human civilization. as is feared by the whole world, preservation of the environment is becoming an awfully grave and pressing problem that is linked to the existence of mankind. how the problems of the global warming and environmental preservation are handled today will have a major impact on the lives and health of people as well as the future development of the world. however, as was revealed this time, japan, which was in a position to take the lead to solve the environmental problems, attempted to back away from solving the problems. nonetheless, japan, changing its stand this time, opposed the draft regulations to put the kyoto protocol into force and even called for liquidation of the draft. what japan is doing with respect to the issue of putting the kyoto protocol into force is tantamount to an act of betrayal against mankind in the effort to protect human lives, health, and the earth's atmosphere. nonetheless, japan is backing away from resolving the issue, although it is in a position to play a leading role.
