westinghouse electric corp., capitalizing on a major restructuring program, expects operating margins of more than 10% and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year, top officers told securities analysts here. john c. marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5% annually through the next three years. in 1988, the company earned $822.8 million, or $5.66 a share, on sales of $12.49 billion. since 1983, westinghouse has shed 70 businesses that it didn't expect to produce 10% operating margins while acquiring 55 businesses. in the past 20 months alone, paul e. lego, president and chief operating officer, said the divestiture of $300 million of slow-growth, low-profit businesses has been more than offset by $600 million in profitable acquisitions. a bright spot is the company's power-generation business, which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years. mr. marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company's target goal of 8.5%.
