brussels - new confidential documents indicate that current israeli prime minister ariel sharon and the army's former leadership were directly responsible for massacres in the palestinian refugee camps of sabra and shatila in 1982. lawyers for the survivors, who have filed a complaint against sharon in belgium, said this. on behalf of some palestinian survivors, lawyers luc walleyn and michael verhaeghe on 18 june filed a complaint with the brussels public prosecution office against sharon and other israeli and lebanese persons deemed responsible for the massacres in beirut. it had already been known that lebanese phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with israel, but according to the lawyers, various documents now indicate that israel and the phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance, that israel exercised complete control over the militias, and that, in the wake of the massacres, the israeli army instructed the phalange to assume responsibility. senior generals and sharon bore command responsibility [preceding two words published in english] for the militias' actions. tomorrow, the chamber for indictments will begin the debate on investigating judge collignon's questions on the legitimacy of the case against sharon. the lawyers deemed it wise to do this now because one of collignon's questions is connected with the juridical consequences of a lebanese amnesty law.
