the tragic and shocking events that shook the united states, destroying a number of its economic, urban, and military landmarks, have aroused grief and sorrow worldwide. the scenes of destruction reminded the palestinian people of the ongoing devastation and the palestinians who are falling victim to the israeli acts of bombardment, targeted assassinations, and incursions into palestinian towns and villages, including bayt jala, gaza, khan yunus, rafah, janin, tulkarm, ramlallah, jericho, nabulus, and others. nobody who has a live conscience and human feelings, whether he is palestinian or otherwise, could not have been moved by these events and expressed sympathy for the families of the us victims, regardless of the us political stances that are totally biased to israel and israel's use of the most advanced us weapons to curb the palestinian intifadah. if any people are going to be moved by the scenes of destruction that involved manhattan, the world trade center, and the pentagon, it is the palestinian people. these people saw the majority of their security sites destroyed and the residential neighborhoods and apartment buildings parallel to the combat lines with the israeli army and settlements in the west bank and gaza targeted by the apaches helicopters and large-caliber artillery and machine guns. however, for israel to take advantage of the us tragedy to claim that it is standing in one ditch with the united states against the violence of terrorism, this is a twisted logic. while the world is busy following the news of the attacks on the us targets and feeling sorry for these acts, israel carried out an incursion into janin and the neighboring villages, bombarded more palestinian internal security sites, demolished more homes in east jerusalem, and killed an additional number of palestinian activists and non-activists, including an 11-year-old girl.
