hundreds of spectators waved and cheered as finch , dressed in a beige flight suit , climbed into the cockpit of the electra and revved the engines. the plane , one of only two remaining , was painstakingly restored for _ world flight 1997 , _ a $4.5-million project to visit five continents and 20 countries on a 30,000-mile ( 48,000 km ) route similar to that taken by earhart. _ we_ 're finally ready to leave. trailed by a blue grumman amphibious plane that will act as her safety net , finch left miami after a week of meetings with schoolchildren , preparations on the electra and a_bit_of fishing , as earhart is said to have done six decades ago. you really get focused on the details of making the flight and the plane and what it needs as you_ 're flying , _ finch said. _ i think amelia's journey was much harder without fax machines and telephones to arrange for fuel and oil and landing permits , _ she said. _ it must have been difficult. _ finch's aides say the pilot is reluctant to compare her flight to earhart's , believing the message of the pioneering aviator's cause was lost in the mystery of her disappearance. earhart , the first woman to fly solo across the atlantic , completed 22,000 miles ( 35,400 km ) of her journey and vanished in july 1937 on the leg from new guinea to howland island. jane logman of the netherlands , the wife of a pilot , said finch was a role model to her 15-year-old daughter , who had just begun pilot training. _ i would like my daughter to do the same ( as finch ) , _ logman said. _ she_ 's an inspiration and especially because she_ 's a woman. _ world flight is sponsored by pratt & whitney , a subsidiary of united technologies corp , which distributed a free educational program to schools throughout the united states. the education program was designed to teach students about earhart and to spur interest in science , math and geography. _ what amelia did is to try and set a new world record , _ finch said. _ but what we_ 're doing is to communicate a message , that you do not have to live within defined limits that society sets or that many people set for themselves. _ some children in the crowd , many of whose parents had not been born when earhart died , seemed well-informed about earhart's journey , calling her a _ hero _ and an _ inspiration. _ but matt bodenhamer , 8 , of miami , expressed doubts about finch's re-creation. _ i think it_ 's crazy.
