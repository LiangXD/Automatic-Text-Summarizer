Eiichiro Tokumoto TOKYO 1997-03-31 East Asian grain buyers are largely holding back on their corn purchases ahead_of key impending U.S. agricultural data , dealers said on Monday. In South Korea , dealers said local buyers were a_little leery of the USDA report and were largely staying on the sidelines having already covered most of their needs up_to August shipment. _ Most of our clients will take some break since they have covered their requirements for far forward shipments to August , _ a trader with a foreign grain trading house in Seoul said. Elsewhere in the East Asian grains market , the Philippines is to tender , on a a snap basis , for 40,000 tonnes of corn for mid-April shipment and local traders confirmed the purchase by two mills of 100,000 tonnes of Canadian wheat. A trader with South Korea's National Livestock Cooperatives Federation ( NLCF ) also dismissed the market talk. _ We have heard ( of ) the rumour but there is no problem. _ Since January , South Korean buyers have bought at_least 1.022 million tonnes of Chinese corn through tenders and private negotiations , traders said. But other Japanese buyers are holding off believing Chinese offers are still too high. _ Chinese corn is not cheap enough , with freight costs around $20 ( a tonne ) China is just trying to export corn to solve their storage problem in corn growing regions , not to earn hard currency , _ another corn trader in Tokyo said.
