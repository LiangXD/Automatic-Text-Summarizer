Dear , A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill's help. In addition to that, by helping them find jobs, Goodwill reduced the state's Public Support tab by an estimated $4 million. Your gift to Goodwill will help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly support our work. Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities. At Goodwill she gained in self-confidence, in her vision of her future and in the job skills she needed to find and keep a good job. Goodwill prepares people for life-long employment. Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill. After a lifetime of trials, Donna not only earned her GED at Goodwill, she earned a job here. Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their own stories of success.
