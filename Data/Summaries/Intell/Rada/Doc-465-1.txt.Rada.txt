At the time when the abortive coup had just taken place, the United States did not show the slightest sympathy, still less the least regret, for the breaking-off of Venezuela's democratic system. Both the White House and the US State Department expressed satisfaction over the stepping-down of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's constitutional president, and no one wept over him. Besides, they also claimed that Chavez had only himself to blame for the coup. This special meeting was initiated by the United States, with only one single goal to fulfill, that is, instigating OPCW member states to vote out Bustani. Why has the United States been picking on Chavez and Bustani all this time? After Chavez took office as Venezuelan president, he has pursued an independent foreign policy, and has been out of step with the United States in many areas. It will not be a coup so long as the United States thinks it is not! In simpler terms, the interests of the United States are always above everything else, not only above the sovereignty of other nations, but also above the so-called values of democracy and human rights that the US always likes to dwell on.
