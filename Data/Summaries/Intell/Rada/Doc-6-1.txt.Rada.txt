Tatiana Vacova BRATISLAVA 1996-08-20 Measures by the National Bank of Slovakia to ease the country's money supply may not be working , as a mounting liquidity surplus continues to drive prices down on the money market , analysts said on Tuesday. They said the market's burgeoning liquidity , which is seen driving rates down by some two percentage points to about 10 percent on all maturities , points to the ineffectiveness of the NBS's recent moves to take money out_of circulation. _ The central bank will have to take other measures to stem the money supply , as the effect of the tool it chose to do so is partly eliminated by short-term foreign capital inflows , _ Jozef Bozek of Tatra Banka told Reuters. Last month , the NBS drove interbank interest rates to over 14 percent when , in a move to curtail banks' short-term lending , hiked minimum reserves significantly as_of August 1. The NBS also recently moved to strengthen the crown within the plus or minus five percent band of a dollar/mark basket midpoint it uses to fix the currency daily , further attracting foreign capital. _ The revalued crown boosted the central bank foreign exchange reserves , and eventually the market liquidity , _ said Dalibor Cernicka , a dealer with Istrobanka. _ Even if foreign investors pull out , their package is not so significant to have any major impact on the country , though it could temporarily toss the crown exchange rate , _ Bozek said.
