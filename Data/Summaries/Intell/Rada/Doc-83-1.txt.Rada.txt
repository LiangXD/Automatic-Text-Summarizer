Ellen Freilich NEW YORK 1997-03-31 U.S. Treasuries ended mixed on Monday as quarter-end portfolio adjustments and a steep slide in the stock market aided shorter-term securities , analysts said. Three-month bill rates fell four basis points to 5.19 percent. Six-month bill rates fell five basis points to 5.31 percent. Comments: speech, but more important than other parts of the text that aren't The stock market's plunge of 157.11 points on the Dow , or 2.33 percent , on Monday , following a steep slide on Thursday , probably aided the short end of the maturity curve in the bond market , analysts said. _ You did have some evidence of a heightened preference for liquidity , _ said William Sullivan , senior vice president and director of fixed-income research at Dean Witter Reynolds. _ It_ 's hard to tell whether it was a function of what took place in the equity market or quarter end portfolio adjustments. But both bill and short-coupon yields edged a_bit lower while the back end languished. _ Patrick Dimick , trader and Treasury strategist at UBS Securities Inc. , said the front end of the Treasury curve _ is going to continue to draw some support from flight to quality buying if this stock market carnage continues to grow. The stock market's Dow blue chip index has fallen about seven percent from its all-time high of 7112.10 achieved earlier this year. Dimick said that since the Fed raised rates on March 25 , Treasury bills and short coupons _ have dramatically outperformed intermediate and longer-dated paper , in large part because_of the equity market dynamics. _ A stock market-driven flight-to-quality bid at the front end of the Treasury _ will complicate life greatly _ for people who have placed trades based on the expectation that the yield curve will flatten , Dimick said. Year bill rates slipped two basis points to 5.67 percent on Monday.
