MANILA, Nov 24 (AFP) - President Gloria Arroyo praised Malaysia on Saturday for the swift arrest of Muslim leader Nur Misuari, whose forces embarked on a fresh rebellion this week in the southern Philippines. He suggested that Kuala Lumpur would have to take the initiative, saying that Misuari had apparently violated Malaysian law by entering the country without a passport. The Philippine foreign ministry this week cancelled Misuari's regular and diplomatic passports as a Jolo court ordered his arrest. Malaysia's official Bernama news agency said that Misuari and six of his men were arrested on an island off the Malaysian state of Sabah, which is on Borneo island, while trying to enter the country illegally. A source at the Malaysian embassy in Manila said the Royal Malaysian Police intercepted Misuari's speedboat and arrested all its occupants. Malaysia, which had given sanctuary to Misuari and his guerrillas in the early 1970s, has called on Misuari to end a bloody six-day-old rebellion by his followers in the southern Philippine island of Jolo. Lecaros said that Misuari had developed ties with the Abu Sayyaf rebel group that has carried out a spree of kidnappings. The Philippine government has information that Mr. Misuari has of late developed some links with the Abu Sayyaf about whom more need not be said, he said. Bernama quoted Malaysian police chief Norian Mai as saying police would try to hand Misuari and his men over to the Philippine government as soon as possible.
