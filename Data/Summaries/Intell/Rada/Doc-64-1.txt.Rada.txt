Under the stabilisation plan the Finance Ministry would issue $50 million of 18-month T-notes , which will be bought out by Bulbank , Bulgaria's biggest and most stable state-owned bank. The operation would also involve a buy-back of $50 million worth of dollar-denominated domestic bad debt ( ZUNK ) bonds from the Biochim Bank's portfolio by the ministry.
