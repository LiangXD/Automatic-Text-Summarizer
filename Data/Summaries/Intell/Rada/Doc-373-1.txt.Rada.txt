More Prisoners Detained in Guantanamo Bay Join Hunger Strike Strike Triggered by a TurbanAccording to military sources at the U.S. base, the hunger striker was first triggered on Wednesday when the guard took the turban off the detainee's head while he was still praying. The sources argued that it was against the rules of the prison because the turban could be used to conceal a weapon.
