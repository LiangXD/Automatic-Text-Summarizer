Keiko Takagi TOKYO 1997-03-31 Japan's carmakers are weathering turmoil in the palladium market , including a halt in Russian shipments to Japan and volatile prices , without major changes in their purchasing practices , industry sources say. Palladium and other platinum group metals are used to make key components for catalytic converters , used in car and truck engines to clean exhaust emissions. _ There has been no major shift in our purchasing patterns so_far , _ said a purchasing manager at Toyota Tsusho Corp , trading arm of the Toyota Motor Corp group. _ Palladium prices are still relatively low and we are not overly concerned about the Russian situation , as we expect Russia to resume platinum group metal exports before long , _ he added. Russian supplies of platinum group metals to Japan have been on hold since the start of the year , when export contracts for 1996 expired and the Russian side indefinitely postponed talks on this year's contracts due_to domestic budget wrangling. Japanese trade houses have scrambled in recent months to cover the palladium lost from Russian contracts by buying in the spot market. A purchasing manager at Nissan Motor Co said , however , that she did not feel the palladium market was extremely tight at present , partly because most Japanese carmakers have long-term palladium supply contracts with South African mining houses. She added that recent supply disruptions and price rises were unlikely in the near term to encourage carmakers to cut use of palladium in favour of other platinum group metals. Nissan has been the most aggressive of Japan's carmakers in switching to palladium-only or palladium-rich catalysts in its domestic cars , analysts said. _ We are not mulling any changes in metals used in our auto catalysts at this stage , as changes to existing models would require huge expenditures and time for registration , _ the Nissan source said. _ But in the future when new models are launched , a change is possible if the suspension of Russian supplies is prolonged , _ she added.
