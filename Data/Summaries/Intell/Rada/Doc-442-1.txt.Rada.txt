The centers that serve these areas, Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, Hawthorne Community Center, Southwest Multi-Service Center, and Christamore House, have teamed up to run an exciting job readiness program for 14 and 15 year old area residents called the Summer Enrichment Program. Between June 21 and August 31, 45 youth will spend 20 hours a week developing life management and work ethic skills, learning the computer, visiting area colleges, and interacting with guest speakers. We would like to offer our youth a small reward for their participation by presenting them with gift certificates from Target. Target is well known for it's support of the community, and we believe that the Summer Enrichment Program represents your interests and concerns quite well.
