A container from the Swedish nuclear technology firm Studsvik has leaked radioactive materials. The Swedish and US authorities are looking for people who might have been exposed to dangerous radiation, but there is no indication that the container started to leak in Sweden. According to all indications, the radioactive container sent from the nuclear technology firm Studsvik to the US did not leak during transport within Sweden. The US Transport Department has now informed Studsvik that the measurements done by Federal Express in Paris showed no abnormality. This means that no leak occurred before the container left Paris. It this information is correct, it means that fewer people will have been exposed to radiation, said Hans-Bertil Hakansson, Studsvik managing director and concern chief, to DN [Dagens Nyheter]. The iridium container left Studsvik in Nykoping on 27 December and was shipped via Norrkoping, Arlanda, and Paris to Memphis. Measurements done at Studsvik before dispatch had not shown high radiation values.
