Russian ship might have missed proper linkup with space station CAPE CANAVERAL -- (AP) -- A Russian supply ship docked to the International Space Station on Wednesday, but may not have latched properly into place. NASA officials said it was not clear whether the potential problem would delay tonight's planned launch of space shuttle Endeavour on a station delivery mission. The space station's steering system, turned off for the docking, remained off an extra three hours to give Russian flight controllers time to study the problem.
