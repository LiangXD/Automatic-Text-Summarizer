The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clinton's marital problems a major campaign issue. Hanover would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate, whether she would like him to run for Senate, or whether she would campaign for him if he did. And, for a punch line: Ms. Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said this week that Ms. Hanover had no comment on Mrs. Clinton's potential Senate campaign. Does she have any comment on whether Ms. Hanover plans to be Hillary Clinton's campaign manager? Indis Index Update: NBC, in its Juanita Broaddrick broadcast last night, turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by Broaddrick in the late 1970s that Bill Clinton raped her. (One of the three is Kelsey's sister, whose motives can be similarly questioned; the other two heard Broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip, as only Kelsey and Broaddrick's husband claim to have.)
