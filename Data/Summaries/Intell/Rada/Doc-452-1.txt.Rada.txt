December 1998 Your contribution to Goodwill will mean more than you may know. To help you see how much your contribution means, I'm sharing with you The words of people who have lived Goodwill's mission. Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that comes with work. Now I can buy a soda and spend money. I am now...totally off of welfare. I really like my job. -- Sherry Because people want to work. I wanted to be there...I had my second chance to change my life. -- Donna Because teaching a man to fish will keep him fed for his entire life.

My instructor played a role like no other instructor I've ever had I appreciate everything that Goodwill has done for me. -- Cornell Each year, we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles. Last year, Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their self-sufficiency. Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support services that will help even more find jobs. Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs.
