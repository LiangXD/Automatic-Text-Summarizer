Why Kyoto is a rip-off According to a study released last week by the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, implementation of the 1997 Kyoto global warming treaty would cost our economy 450,000 jobs and as much as $40-billion. According to a report released in 2000 by the National Air Issues Co-ordinating Committee on Climate Change, a group staffed by officials from the federal, provincial and territorial governments, hitting Canada's Kyoto target may mean the loss of roughly one year's growth, or, viewed in absolute terms, in 2010, the loss in annual economic output of approximately $40-billion (or $1,100 per capita). In its authoritative Feb., 2001, report on the projected impacts of global warming, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identified several threats to Canadian ecosystems, but concluded that our farmers would generally benefit from warmer temperatures. As for the globally felt benefits that would follow from Canada's implementation of the Kyoto protocol, they are slight. Even if Canada managed to convince the United States and every other Kyoto signatory to ratify the protocol, world carbon dioxide emissions would still soar. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, world energy consumption will increase by about 60% between now and 2020, with most of the upsurge expected to come from developing nations, which are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Without Kyoto, the figure would be 34%. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions -- a costly burden at home and an impossible task in the developing world -- we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. While helping Third World nations plant new crops, vaccinate people and relocate coastal towns will be costly, the bottom line will likely be only a fraction of Kyoto's 13-digit price tag.
