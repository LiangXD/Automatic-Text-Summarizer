Very few have family support to get them started. To help them establish themselves in the community, the Pleasant Run Emancipation fund was begun in 1993 by private donors who wanted to provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our programs. Possession of a high school diploma or GED Proof of meeting these, two staff reference letters and an essay stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel, which determines if the applicant merits the funds. Because Pleasant Run is the only family for so many, our Emancipation Fund is one way we can help a young person take the first steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive adult. Without private donor support, this Fund doesn't exist.
