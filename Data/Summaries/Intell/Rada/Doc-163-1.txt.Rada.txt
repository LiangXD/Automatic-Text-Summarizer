A cargo ship intercepted in the Channel after a tip-off that it might be carrying terrorist materials was today given the all clear, police said. Assistant Commissioner David Veness, head of Scotland Yard's specialist operations, said: New information, combined with the relentless efforts of scientific experts, our detailed knowledge of the ship and its movements, and very careful examination of the vessel over the last three days leads us to be completely satisfied that the Nisha is not a suspicious vessel and does not pose a danger. The MV Nisha is operated by the Great Eastern Shipping Company, based in Bombay, India. The cargo ship Nisha was intercepted and boarded as part of an intelligence-led operation. Thankfully, the ship has been proved not to pose a danger to the public. Mr Veness praised the crew and ship's owners for their co-operation and said: We remain vigilant and are totally committed to ensuring the safety of the public. The chairman of the British arm of the Great Eastern Shipping Company, Sudhir Mulji, confirmed that the vessel had stopped over at Djibouti before its current journey to drop off American grain as part of a food aid shipment.
