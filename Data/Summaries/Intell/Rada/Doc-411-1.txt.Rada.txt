We don't waste time as we are helping the community. In their December, 1995 review of the nation's best charities, U.S. News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five Standout Good Guys. While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us. At Goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day: A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients: You can earn the money to support yourself and your family, she says. A participant in a Goodwill program rushes back from a job interview to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing training program. once his tears have subsided, he confirms what his classmates have already figured out: he just received a job offer -- his first in five years. Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center, a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs. On his way home, he shares the story with four people at a street corner. He proudly leaves Goodwill to support himself. These people and their successes are real. Just like the impact Goodwill's work has on our community. Real results. Your support helps provide real solutions.
