GENEVA, Jan 18 (AFP) -- A report by delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), currently visiting prisoners from Afghanistan held at a US base in Cuba, will remain confidential, an ICRC spokesman said on Friday [18 January]. Darcy Christen also said that among the prisoners transferred to the US navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were three British citizens and possibly some French speakers. ICRC envoys are discussing with US officials whether to release the number of detainees and their nationalities, said Christen. The number of detainees being held at the isolated US military outpost on Cuba's southwestern coast rose on Thursday to 110 after the arrival of another 30 prisoners from Afghanistan. Christen said detainees from the battle field did not exist as a category under humanitarian law, adding that in an international armed conflict anyone captured on the battlefield was presumed a prisoner of war. Asked about special courts to be set up by the Bush administration to try the al-Qaeda detainees, Christen pointed out the courts were not yet operating and their procedures were still unknown.
