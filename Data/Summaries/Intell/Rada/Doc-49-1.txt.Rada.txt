Taiwan economic minister Wang Chih-kang confirmed receiving such assurances from Formosa chairman Wang Yung-ching and said Taiwan had no intention of allow Formosa to finance the plant. _ We can clearly declare that the government will not allow investment in power plants ( in the Chinese mainland ) , _ Wang Chin-kang said on state radio. Formosa chairman Wang had said on Saturday that his group , Taiwan's top industrial enterprise , had begun construction of a US$3 billion power station in Fujian province in defiance of Taiwan's policy and would not take _ no _ for an answer. _ Once ( construction ) has started , we can_ not order it stopped , _ Wang told reporters. _ If the government disapproves it , we insist to wait and see whether the government policy can be changed. _ On Monday , Formosa appeared to have changed its line , saying that no Formosa unit , affiliate or executive , whether in Taiwan or the United States , had put money into the project. Central Bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong told lawmakers that an initial central bank inquiry showed Formosa had not illegally sent money to China from Taiwan , state media reported. In June 1996 , Formosa said it and local Fujian authorities would jointly build a 3,600-megawatt plant , easily the biggest Taiwan investment in China and the first in the power sector , which Taipei had made off limits for Taiwan investors.
