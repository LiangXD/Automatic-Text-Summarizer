The Zionist and US administrations have the illusion that they succeeded in defeating the Palestinian people and their valiant intifadah. It is also true that thousands of Palestinians and their leaders are held hostage, and that the entire Palestinian people are now experiencing the utmost suffering as part of their daily lives. The Zionists have succeeded in achieving these things, but a deep-rooted fact is that they have not succeeded, and will never succeed, in breaking the will of this valiant people or in forcing the Palestinians into relinquishing their just, legitimate rights and ending their glorious struggle for these rights. The real victor in this battle is, in fact, the Palestinian people and not the Zionists. Most importantly, however, these criminals will have the largest illusion if they imagine that they have succeeded in liquidating the intifadah and destroying its infrastructure after having succeeded in liquidating or arresting a small or large number of the intifadah's leaders and strugglers. Another deep-rooted fact is that the organizations of the Palestinian resistance still preserve their organizational structure and are also characterized by their superb ability to renew their leaders and replace the ones who fall along the path of martyrdom. As has been acknowledged by Uri Avneri, a veteran Zionist writer, the intifadah's structure exists within millions of Palestinians and also within tens of millions of Arabs in whose chests the fire of anger is blazing. The conclusion to which we come is that the Zionist and US administrations have aggravated the Zionist entity's historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that force can break the Palestinian people's will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose.
