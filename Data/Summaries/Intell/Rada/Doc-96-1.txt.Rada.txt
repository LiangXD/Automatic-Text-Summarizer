That may add to fear the Fed will vote to tighten again at its May 20 meeting should the figure come in strong. _ The Chicago ( purchasing managers report ) make us think we may see a 54 reading overall , but the interesting thing may be the supplier/deliveries ( component ) , _ said James Glassman , senior economist at Chase Securities Inc. Given that , the market likely would able to withstand a strong NAPM report , he said. Glassman said the market also may remain stable due_to the lrage amount of news to be digested between now and the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ). _ The market knows this ( manufacturing ) rebound is strong. Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting , on average , 182,000 new nonfarm jobs were created in March , compared to 339,000 in February. _ I would guess the market has already priced in a small increase in NAPM.
