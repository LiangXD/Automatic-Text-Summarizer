Europe to Tax Israeli Settlement Goods RAMALLAH (Palestine Media Center): Signaling a toughening policy towards the illegal Israeli settlements, the European Union's (EU) Origin Committee, which consists of customs experts and commissioners, is to discuss imposing taxes on all Israeli goods produced in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem as well as the occupied Golan Heights. In November of last year, the EU had issued a warning to European importers, specifying that Israeli exports originating in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as well as the Golan Heights were not included in the free trade agreement with Israel. While Israel rejects the EU plan for political and economic reasons, the EU affirms its position of not recognizing the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as a legitimate part of Israel.
