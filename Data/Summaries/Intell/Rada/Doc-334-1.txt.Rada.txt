In the past four months, the shekel has lost 20 percent of its value against the dollar. Most of the Argentine government's debt is in dollars, while most of the Israeli government's debt is, fortunately, in shekels. The structure of the Israeli economy is basically sound, but on the other hand, Israel is at war, with a significant proportion of its resources devoted to defense. Sound management of the economy is an essential element in the conduct of the war against Palestinian violence and terrorism. With good economic management, Israel should have little trouble overcoming the present crisis. Based on false premises regarding anticipated government revenues and underestimates of the need for defense expenditures, a totally unrealistic budget was prepared. Finally, the ministry realized the budget it had prepared would have to be drastically revised and curtailed. But all the talk of big cuts in the budgets of most of the ministries came to naught. Then the finance minister dramatically announced an emergency economic plan based on large-scale tax increases in an already over-taxed economy. At the same time, there was no let-up in his continuing battle with the governor of the Bank of Israel, who is supposed to be his partner in managing Israel's economy. It should be clear that the problem Israel is facing at this time has much more than just an economic dimension. But successful management of the economy - the second front - is essential so that the resources needed for defense needs can be made available without causing serious damage to the economy. @ CopyRight 2002 Ha'aretz.
