CHICAGO 1997-03-31 Implied volatilities for U.S. interest rate options were steady to higher in quiet dealings , with the underlying futures posting mild declines on the day. Volatilities at the short end of the yield curve were bid for a second day , as the market continues to adjust for a higher interest rate environment after a prolonged period of stability , Eurodollar analysts said. Interest rate futures' selloff late last week provided the catalyst for volatility to ascend , Eurodollar traders said. Among the larger transactions in Eurodollar options trading was a Japanese bank's sale of 1,000 June 93.75 puts at a premium of two basis points. Treasury bond volatility held fairly steady , with both May and June options pegged late in the session at 9.5 percent. Some analysts predicted bond volatility would start to attract a bid heading into Friday's U.S. jobs report.
