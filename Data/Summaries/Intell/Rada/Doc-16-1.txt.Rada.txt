Martin Wolk SEATTLE 1996-08-19 The Internet browser wars heated up Monday as market leader Netscape Communications Corp launched its latest Navigator software and officials of rival Microsoft Corp. said they saw little new. Netscape , countering Microsoft's high-profile launch of its Internet Explorer 3.0 last week , said it had linked up with more than 20 content providers , including The New York Times and Sportsline USA , to offer tailored news and information to users. While Netscape has a commanding lead in the growing browser market , with a share estimated at over 80 percent , industry analysts say Microsoft's latest software poses a threat to that dominance. _ I_ 'd say at the very minimum Microsoft has leveled the playing field , and the real battle can now begin , _ said Adam Schoenfeld of the Jupiter Communications research firm. In a statement sent to reporters , Redmond , Wash.-based Microsoft called Netscape's new electronic mail feature _ glorified junk mail _ and said its own Internet Explorer offers faster access to multimedia clips. The new browser will be integrated into the Windows operating system , allowing users to _ browse _ through their local computer as_well_as the Internet. _ Netscape does_ n't own the operating system , so it will be very difficult for them to counter that , _ said Michael Wallace of UBS Securities.
