SAO PAULO 1997-03-31 Double world champion Michael Schumacher learned on Sunday that his season was again going to be a struggle $-- thanks_to the Formula One tyre war. Schumacher had hoped to lead his Italian team on a championship challenge this year and he made it clear he felt his bid had been undermined by his car's Goodyear tyres , while rivals like Frenchman Olivier Panis and reigning champion Damon Hill were making the most of the new Bridgestone rubber. But just as I expected , our tyres did not maintain their performance level over the whole race. _ I had a job getting past Hill as his tyres were still in top condition and this lost me a_lot_of time and probably cost me at_least one or two places. _ Even before the season began , Schumacher was warning former monopoly suppliers Goodyear that they needed to improve the tyres they supplied to the top teams if they were to resist the challenge from the newly-entered Japanese company Bridgestone. Panis , fifth in the first race of the season in Australia , finished third to score the Prost team and Bridgestone's first podium finish , while Hill , after running as high as fourth in a car which was abysmal in Melbourne , eventually retired with a blown Yamaha engine. _ The tyres were fantastic , _ Panis said. _ It will not be long_before we can win a race with them. _ Hill's team also praised the Bridgestone tyres. But it was a bad day for his new team mate , German Heinz-Harald Frentzen , who finished ninth. _ He had a_lot_of problems this weekend and we need to sit down and sort them out , _ Williams team technical director Patrick Head said. _ There is some talking to be done. _ Given Hill's strong showing , the Williams team may be wondering if they made the right decision in dropping the world champion last year and bringing in the relatively inexperienced Frentzen to replace him.
