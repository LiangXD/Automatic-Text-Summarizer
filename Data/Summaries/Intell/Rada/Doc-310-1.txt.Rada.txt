Africa Endorses Mugabe Victory, the West Condemns It International reaction to the controversial re-election of Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe to another six year term varied widely. African observers generally approved of his victory, while Western governments denounced it. Observer missions from South Africa, Nigeria, Namibia and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) respectively, described the poll as legitimate - largely satisfactory and transparent, credible, free and fair. President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya congratulated Mugabe, calling his victory testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of Zimbabwe hold in you. The observations of the 14-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) Parliamentary Forum team differed considerably from the other African missions. In sharp contrast to other African observer teams, the forum said the conduct of the elections fell short of regional expectations. That position chimed closely with views expressed by the main Zimbabwean monitoring group, the Zimbabwe Election Support Network which had 400 observers monitoring the poll and have been heavily critical. The SADC parliamentarians' view was also echoed by the Norwegian observer delegation which said, on Tuesday, that the election failed to meet international standards. Mugabe's main challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change, has rejected the outcome of the presidential poll. The government has rejected all criticism, describing the election as exemplary, free, fair and peaceful. We do not recognize the outcome of the election because we think it's flawed. Bush's secretary of state, Colin Powell, earlier concluded: Mr Mugabe may claim victory, but not democratic legitimacy. If the people of Zimbabwe have a sense that they have been cheated through the election process, it is possible that some could resort to violence, said the foreign minister, Alexander Downer.
