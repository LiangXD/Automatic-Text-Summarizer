NEW YORK 1997-03-31 While shares of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp took a beating Monday following a federal probe and media reports about its billing practices , industry analysts continued to support the stock. Columbia/HCA lost 4-3/4 to 33 and was the heavily traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has dropped sharply in the past two weeks as news of the federal probe of its El Paso operations surfaced. So , the fact that they are only in one location leads one to think that it_ 's not a company-wide issue , _ Joseph Chiarelli , an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities. _ What would make me uncomfortable is if the government went into other markets and locations at Columbia. Analysts cautioned that the New York Times used its own methodology , which has not been verified by others in the healthcare industry , as the basis of its article. Analysts expect Columbia/HCA's stock to continue to face near-term pressure but said the company will remain a market leader over the long-term. _ The stock was in for a tough day today. The stock will rebound , but I expect continued negative commentary to pressure the stock for the near-term , _ John Hindelong , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette. _ We still think Columbia is a giant $-- a market leader that is incredibly successful.
