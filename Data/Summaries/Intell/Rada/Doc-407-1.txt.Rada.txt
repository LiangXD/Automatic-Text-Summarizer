May 23 (Interfax) - The Russian Aerospace Agency is continuing its active search for a space tourist candidate who would fly to the International Space Station (ISS) in autumn, agency director Yuri Koptev told Interfax on Thursday. A source in space circles told Interfax that the applications came from one Russian citizen, a woman from Australia and one more unnamed person. However, the Russian Aerospace Agency told Interfax that it has not received any official applications from either the Americans or the Russian pop group. At the moment, the probability of the third space tourist making a space flight this year is 70-80%, informed sources told Interfax on Thursday.
