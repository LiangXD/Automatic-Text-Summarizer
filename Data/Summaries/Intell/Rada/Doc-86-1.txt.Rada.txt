Jim Loney MIAMI 1997-03-31 Linda Finch , the Texas businesswoman and aviator who is retracing the flight of the legendary Amelia Earhart 60 years ago , took off on Monday on the first over-water leg of her round-the-world journey.

The plane , one of only two remaining , was painstakingly restored for _ World Flight 1997 , _ a $4.5-million project to visit five continents and 20 countries on a 30,000-mile ( 48,000 km ) route similar to that taken by Earhart. _ We_ 're finally ready to leave. Finch , who early on Monday helped stow luggage aboard the plane and joined a horde of helpers to push it from a hangar , said she had been consumed with final flight details. _ I think Amelia was probably the same way. You really get focused on the details of making the flight and the plane and what it needs as you_ 're flying , _ Finch said. _ I think Amelia's journey was much harder without fax machines and telephones to arrange for fuel and oil and landing permits , _ she said. _ It must have been difficult. _ Finch's aides say the pilot is reluctant to compare her flight to Earhart's , believing the message of the pioneering aviator's cause was lost in the mystery of her disappearance. The education program was designed to teach students about Earhart and to spur interest in science , math and geography. _ What Amelia did is to try and set a new world record , _ Finch said. _ But what we_ 're doing is to communicate a message , that you do not have to live within defined limits that society sets or that many people set for themselves. _ Some children in the crowd , many of whose parents had not been born when Earhart died , seemed well-informed about Earhart's journey , calling her a _ hero _ and an _ inspiration. _ But Matt Bodenhamer , 8 , of Miami , expressed doubts about Finch's re-creation. _ I think it_ 's crazy.
