Mugabe wins poll, amid claims of rigging HARARE, March 13 (AFP) - Zimbabwe's long-time ruler Robert Mugabe swept to victory Wednesday in Presidential elections in a vote that challenger Morgan Tsvangirai declared was rigged and unacceptable. Registrar General Tobaiwa Mudede announced on state television that Mugabe was re-elected with 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,758 votes for Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). As the results were being announced, about 100 heavily armed soldiers moved into Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayao and surrounded the MDC offices, where opposition officials had gathered. Tsvangirai rejected Mugabe's election victory out of hand. The MDC leadership was due to meet later Wednesday to discuss the poll results, and Tsvangirai was due to address a media conference afterwards. The election is the hardest fought battle for Zimbabwe's top post since liberation war hero Mugabe took over after independence from Britain in 1980. 'The election was preceded by months of government-orchestrated violence meant to intimidate voters (and) the opposition was repeatedly harassed and prevented from campaigning,' she said. Turnout across the southern African country was an estimated 66 per cent in an election fraught by violence, intimidation and intense legal wrangling over civic rights and electoral rules. Even after the polls closed Monday, Mugabe's government kept up the pressure on the opposition by charging MDC Secretary General Welshman Ncube with high treason, which the party dismissed as a smear tactic.
