Africa's Grand Bargain All was not lost in Zimbabwe's rigged election last week. Their courageous stand will help renew a promise by leading industrialized nations to provide more aid, trade, and investment only if Africa shows better governance and democracy. This grand bargain to uplift the world's poorest continent would have been in jeopardy if Thabo Mbeki, south Africa's president, and Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's president, had not agreed to suspend Zimbabwe from the 54-nation group of former British colonies known as the Commonwealth. The grand pact, known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, was initiated by the two leaders. Without the rule of law and fair elections in Africa, no amount of aid can help it. South Africa's leader, Mbeki, who has been inclined toward quiet diplomacy with Zimbabwe, has now made himself heard.
