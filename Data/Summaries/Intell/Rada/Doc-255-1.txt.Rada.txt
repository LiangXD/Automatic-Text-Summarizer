Operating profit for the abrasives, engineering materials and petroleum services concern was $19.2 million, or 91 cents a share, up 3% from $18.7 million, or 87 cents a share. Sales rose 8% to $368.5 million from $340.7 million. However, the company's petroleum services segment, while profitable, was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company's buy-out of a 50% stake in Eastman Christensen Co. from Texas Eastern Corp. last June. In the year-earlier period, the company had net of $77.2 million, or $3.68 a share, and a tax credit of $7.7 million.
