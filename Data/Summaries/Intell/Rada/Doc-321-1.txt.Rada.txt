Dr. MacLean will join the Endeavour crew for the 10-day mission to complete the next stage of assembling the International Space Station. Canadarm 2, a crane-like device attached to the station, will be used to its fullest extent when Dr. MacLean moves a communication aerial from one end of the craft to the other. In May, Dr. MacLean will be working at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, during the next shuttle shot to the station. As capsule communicator, Dr. MacLean will relay information between the shuttle crew and Mission Control during flights. But Marc Garneau, the head of Canada's Space Agency, said how many more international astronauts will follow Dr. MacLean into space is an issue Canada and other nations are facing after the U.S. said last year it will reduce the scope of the space station program. The space station's emergency rescue ship to return the crew is a Russian Soyuz spacecraft that can only accommodate three crew members. The pressure at this point is to try and get our American colleagues to live up to the obligation that is embodied in the inter-governmental agreements we all signed, said Dr. Garneau, Canada's first astronaut.When it is fully constructed, the space station's lifespan is 20 years, so it is vital to enlarge the size of the crew, Dr. Garneau said. Construction of the space station began in the mid-1980s.
