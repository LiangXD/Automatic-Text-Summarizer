We've helped people break free of the welfare cycle. We've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce. You have helped make Goodwill's work possible with your previous support. There are a lot of barriers that keep people from working: physical and mental disabilities, history of welfare dependency and lack of education or self-esteem. Everyone benefits from the work we do together. Please continue our important partnership.
