Sonali Desai SINGAPORE 1997-03-31 Diversified conglomerate Singapore Technologies Industrial Corporation ( STIC ) posted a 22 percent increase in 1996 net profit on Monday and said it saw improved earnings in the current financial year. He said STIC was likely to post sustainable growth of at_least 20 percent in net profit over the next two years , with its industrial park activities continuing to drive earnings. STIC president Tay Siew Choon told a news conference the group would increase its investment in heavy infrastructure projects , including bridges , expressways and power plants , with a continued focus on China , India and Indonesia. Pre-tax profit from the group's travel and leisure divisions fell to S$2.65 million in 1996 from S$3.89 million the previous year due_to start-up costs and difficult industry conditions , Tay said. He said the first phase of STIC's resort project on Bintan was likely to start contributing to profits over the next two or three years , eventually helping offset an estimated S$100 million in start-up costs for the second phase. Tay said the group aimed to build its business to ensure sustainable profit growth of 20-25 percent but added that there could be some volatility on an annual basis , depending on whether its projects were in development or start-up phases.
