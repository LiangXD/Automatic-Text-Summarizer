New crew settles in at space station CAPE CANAVERAL -- (AP) -- Two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut moved into the International Space Station on Saturday, settling in for a half-year stay. The new residents' form-fitting seat liners for the lifeboat had to be carried over and installed, and their space suits tucked away, before they could call space station Alpha home. Russian Yuri Onufrienko couldn't wait to take over as space station commander from American Frank Culbertson. As gear moved back and forth across the threshold, Endeavour's astronauts used the ship's robot arm to lift an Italian-built cargo carrier from the shuttle and attach it to the station.
