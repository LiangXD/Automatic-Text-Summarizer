By Richard Longworth DIESEL engines are the most fuel efficient vehicle power source available. Trucks , buses and most taxis use them , and 40 per_cent of vehicle fuel sold in the UK last year was diesel. But diesel engines also have very dirty exhaust emissions. While not having the concentrations of poisonous gases found in petrol engine exhausts , they give out far more & bquo ; particulates & equo ; ( soot ). Diesel engine manufacturers have long maintained that these are harmless , but recently they have been found to contain polyaromatich hydrocarbons ( PAH ) , which can cause cancer when breathed deeply. While the first level of cuts can be reached using existing levels of technology , the second stage , likely in 1994 , will require a new generation of engines. These will be electronically controlled , a technical task far harder on a diesel engine than on its petrol counterpart. Some manufacturers such as MAN and DAF have solved the problem by fitting filters which clean themselves with a small furnace as the vehicle is in operation. Unlike lead , which the fuel companies eventually proved only too pleased to take out_of petrol , sulphur does nothing for either the performance or longevity of diesel engines and it contributes to acid rain. Currently , diesel fuel sold in the EC contains 0.3 per_cent sulphur , except in West Germany where the level is 0.25 per_cent. London buses , for_example , are exempt from traffic lawsaffecting other vehicles , which in the competitive deregulated world of modern bus operation , include expensive pollution control.
