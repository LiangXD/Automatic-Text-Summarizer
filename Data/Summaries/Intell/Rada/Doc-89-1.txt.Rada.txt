A report published last Thursday by Oil Price Information Service , an oil industry publication , said that an _ imminent _ deal would give Marathon 52 percent of Ashland's three U.S. refineries and retail network. _ We_ 've been linked with several companies _ since the December announcement , Rice noted. Marathon also declined to comment on whether_or_not the two companies had a deal. _ That talk has been going on for months , but we do not have a comment on that issue , _ said John Farrell , a Marathon spokesman. Under the restructuring , the largest section of Ashland Inc was bundled into the Ashland Petroleum Group , including the large Catlettsburg , Kentucky refinery and two smaller plants at St. Paul , Minnesota and Canton , Ohio which together have capacity to process slighly more than 350,000 barrels of crude a day.
