Cubans celebrate Venezuelan president's return to power, compare botched coup to Bay of Pigs HAVANA - (AP) -- Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power at a rally Tuesday, likening the failed coup against the Cuban ally to the disastrous U.S.-backed effort to overthrow Fidel Castro's government 41 years ago. He said it was a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came so soon after Venezuelans "have written a page of dignity and honor by going out into the streets to overthrow the coup attempt." At the Bay of Pigs, a CIA-trained force of about 1,500 exiles invaded in an effort to overthrow Castro's government, which had seized power 28 months before.
