William Kazer BEIJING 1997-03-31 The United States and China may not be on the verge of a breakthrough in often testy ties , but both sides can claim gains from visits by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich , analysts said on Monday. Gore reassured the Chinese that Washington remained committed to an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin , telling reporters that officials from both countries were working on specific dates. Gore , the most senior U.S. official in Beijing since the 1989 crackdown on student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square , said his talks with Chinese leaders last week touched on the key areas of disagreement but he described China's reaction as milder than in the past. While the speaker of the House of Representatives had somewhat tougher talk in public for his Chinese hosts , pointedly referring to Beijing's policies on human rights and Taiwan , the content was not unexpected. _ He is a_bit less constrained in what he can say , _ said a Chinese journalist who covers foreign affairs. _ China recognises this. _ More importantly for China's leaders , the visit by the key Republican and other members of a bipartisan congressional delegation presented an opportunity for Beijing to make a personal pitch on major issues such as Taiwan. The visit also underscored Washington's hopes that no one issue be allowed to dominate the Sino-U.S. relationship. _ Trade issues as_well_as human rights will all remain on the table for discussion in the future , _ said another diplomat.
