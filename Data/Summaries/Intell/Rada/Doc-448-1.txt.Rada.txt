November 27, 1995 Dear Friend: What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run Children's Homes? Young adults, like Mary T., a jobless mother of three, trying desperately to keep her kids out of trouble in a crime-ridden neighborhood. Today, we serve children and families with a multitude of problems: emotional, physical, psychological and sexual abuse. In 1994 Pleasant Run served 346 children and 125 families. In 1995 we will serve over 850 children and 340 families. The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given the opportunity to become happy, loving, and productive members of our society. For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families, we need your support. Your gift will give children and families hope for improved tomorrows.
