Steven Scheer NEW YORK 1997-03-31 With the increasing likelihood the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again by early July , U.S. Treasury market participants said that the bill sector should benefit from rising coupon yields and a big drop in stock prices. Bills $-- primarily three $- and six-month $-- have outperformed the rest of the yield curve since last Tuesday's quarter-point rate hike by the Fed. The six-month bill rate was at 5.31 percent , down about five basis points from early last week. Some of the money in stocks was shifted to bills , traders said , although a major allocation out_of stocks is not expected. _ Unless you see stocks down 1,000 points , you wo_ n't see a meaningful shift , _ said Mark Mahoney , Treasury market strategist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. Traders noted that the near term directon of the curve and whether bills can hold at what is perceived to be 10 basis points too expensive lies with Friday's March employment report. _ If we get a weaker jobs report and people say the Fed will ( skip ) the next tightening ( in May ) , we may see bills start to loosen up , _ said a trader at a Japanese-based dealer.
