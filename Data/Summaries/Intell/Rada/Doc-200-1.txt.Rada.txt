Per Stig Moller: Give Them Rights Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller (Conservative People's Party) is urging the United States to guarantee the prisoners the status of prisoners of war and in consequence protection under the terms of the Geneva Convention. Social Democratic Party: Raise Denmark's Voice The Social Democratic Party takes the view that the Danish Government should raise its voice against the United States. The Socialist People's Party is sending an urgent call to the government to deliver official criticism to the United States. Danish People's Party: Are They Danes? The Danish People's Party sees no reason to criticize the United States. I can imagine that the United States has had good reasons for transporting them to Cuba, foreign affairs spokesman Peter Skaarup (Danish People's Party) says. As long as no Danes are involved, the Danish People's Party does not think that Denmark should interfere.
