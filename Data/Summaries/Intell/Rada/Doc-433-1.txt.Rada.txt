Pat LaCrosse asked me to send this information inviting you to join the Georgia O'Keeffe Circle of the Indianapolis Museum of Art's Second Century Society (SCS). The SCS brochure I am enclosing will give you the historic significance of SCS, as well as listing activities and specific benefits awarded to donors at the Georgia O'Keeffe level. Your Georgia O'Keeffe membership, please note, includes free admission to all art-related activities of the IMA's Young Friends of Art group. These are particularly exciting times at the Indianapolis Museum of Art: Progress continues on the J.K. Lilly estate-Oldfields, our Ravine Garden has been restored to its original splendor, and there is national attention showered on our current exhibition of Japanese Painting.
