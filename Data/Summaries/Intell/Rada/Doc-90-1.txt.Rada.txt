US OPTIONS FOCUS/Indexes slow , more declines seen. One trader in Chicago said the low volume indicated the selloff may not be over. _ What I see is low volume and when you have low volume in a dropping market , that_ 's not good because you do_ n't get the climax , _ he said. _ Looking at it today , this is not the climax becaue the volume is very low. _ By late trading , the bellwether Dow industrial average was down 111 points , or 1.65 percent , at about 6,630. A string of economic reports , including the key jobs report , which is scheduled for release Friday , was one factor keeping investors sidelined , but traders said last week's selloff also was a factor. _ As far as buying , there has_ n't been a lot , _ the trader in Chicago said. _ Everyone is just holding their breath. _ Nobody is paying up for the puts _ where premiums remained rich , he said , adding that some investors were buying puts , expecting a bounce. One broker in Chicago said some investors were attempting to play the OEX options , but wide spreads and stiff premiums made them difficult to trade. Jerry Hegarty , an analyst at Thomson Financial Services , said in a report that by afternoon , OEX put buying topped call buying by only 6,000 contracts despite the market's drop. Although options trading indicated investor complacency , some indicators suggested bearishness was on the rise , which is bullish for contrarians.
