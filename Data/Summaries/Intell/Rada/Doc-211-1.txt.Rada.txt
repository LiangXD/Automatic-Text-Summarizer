As usual, the US State Department published its annual report on human rights practices in world countries last Monday. Its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government, human rights experts said at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR) on Friday. The United States was slandering China again, said Xirao-Nima, a professor of Tibetan history at the Central University for Nationalities. It has no right to issue such a false human rights report, experts said. But it never requested or authorized the United States to compile or release such reports. It somewhat softens its tone in the China human rights report. I have seen the truth there, which is very different from what some US politicians with ulterior motives have described, said Xirao-Nima, who is a Tibetan. From 1989 to 1994, the central government invested 53 million yuan (US$6.4 million) to repair the Potala Palace. The Italian senator's words are in sharp contrast to what was contained in the so-called China human rights report compiled by the United States, which blindly accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet. The report said China should not have arrested Li, a Hong Kong businessman, who was charged with smuggling Bibles into the country in July. Cao said the smuggled Bibles were editions translated by the 'Shouters' sect. The US human rights report also accuses China of taking advantage of anti-terrorism campaigns to crackdown on ethnic group people living in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Those that want to secede from the nation and engage in terrorist activities are terrorists, not any particular ethnic group, said Ma Dazheng, director of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's Development Research Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
