sarajevo, jan 18 (onasa) -- the decision on extradition of six algerians to the united states is in accordance with the responsibility and authorities of the bih federation bodies and international obligations, the coordination team for anti-terrorism said in a statement on friday [18 january]. bosnian authorities have handed over to us custody six algerians detained in october on suspicion of involvement in terrorism but ordered released this week by a local court, the us embassy said on friday. earlier, the us embassy in sarajevo said in a statement: the six algerian nationals who have been detained by bih (bosnia and herzegovina) authorities since mid-october have been transferred to us custody. we have taken custody of these individuals due to our concern about their activity in bih, which both posed a credible security threat to us personnel and facilities and demonstrated involvement in international terrorism, it said. washington insisted it would not have acted without credible evidence, but the transfer exposed it to more criticism from campaigners who have accused it of disregarding human rights in its declared war on terror. not only had a court ordered their release on thursday but the state's top human rights body had instructed authorities to prevent four being taken out of the country by force. international officials said us officials had not been willing to provide bosnia's justice system with the intelligence information that prompted their detention.
