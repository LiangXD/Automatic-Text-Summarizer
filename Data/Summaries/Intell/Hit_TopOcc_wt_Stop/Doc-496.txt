us ambassador to indonesia ralph l. boyce praised the indonesian government on monday [18 mar] for its efforts to protect foreign investors in the country, including americans, but warned that investors were still concerned about the security of their investments. boyce acknowledged that the indonesian government had taken serious steps to ensure the personal safety of american investors and other foreigners, who appeared at risk several months ago during the political tension following the us-led war against afghanistan's taliban regime. but, he said, investors will come to indonesia not based on fears, somehow, that they would be physically threatened, but rather in the hope that the capital invested in indonesia would be secure and that means transparency, rule of law, protection legally, etc., boyce told a press conference. but the government was quick to give assurances about the safety of foreign workers in indonesia. the singapore-based members of this mission want to hear from senior members of the indonesian government about efforts to expand foreign business participation in the economy. we know that indonesia is a country of enormous potential and believe that now is the time to build our future together, hicks said in a statement. rini said she had pointed to the batam and bintan islands as secure places for doing business, citing the small number of labour disputes in both islands.
