the report fails to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives by the government of pakistan to promote and protect human rights, a foreign office spokesman said. the spokesman said that the us report ignored the implementation of almost all initiatives announced and set at an april 2000 human rights conference. these initiatives included the promulgation of the juvenile justice system ordinance, the establishment of a permanent commission on the status of women, police and jail reforms, national policy and plan of action for elimination of child labour and establishment of a fund for rehabilitation of working children. the spokesman said: the government has amended pakistan citizenship act of 1951 to enable women of pakistani descent to claim pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. the government of pakistan, therefore, feels constrained to reject the assessment of the report about pakistan, and the tendency of some states to sit in judgement over others. the cause of human rights would be better served if all states, in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, address the problems they face in promoting and protecting human rights. he said that the government of pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and will welcome the assistance of friendly countries towards that end.
