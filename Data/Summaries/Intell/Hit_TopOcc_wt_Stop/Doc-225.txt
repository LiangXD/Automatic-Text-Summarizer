with this major decision, the european union is opening the door to the entry into force of the kyoto protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in august 2002 in johannesburg. the united states, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (25 percent of global emissions) withdrew from an international agreement that, for the first time, set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection. however, all the parties repeated with insistence that world climate protection cannot be effective unless the united states takes measures that are comparable to these taken by europe and japan. the average global temperature will increase by 5.8d c by 2100, sea levels will rise by up to 90 cm over the same period, and there will be an increasing number of hurricanes with ever more serious consequences, while man and nature will have to cope with a shift in climate and rainfall zones the like of which has never been seen before. at our instigation, on 4 march eu environment ministers therefore called on the united states to assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change, that is to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels and strengthen domestic actions to bring them into line with the level of effort accepted by the industrial countries in application of the kyoto protocol. if the effects of climate change were not so devastating and our action were to be guided by economic competition, we europeans could welcome the fact that the united states is not committing itself to an ambitious climate protection program, in so far as the technologies in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy are the technologies of the future. the door remains wide open for the united states to return to the kyoto process: the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection.
