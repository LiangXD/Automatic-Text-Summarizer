russia disagrees with 'axis' remark munich, germany -- russia's defense minister said sunday that his country disagrees with the u.s. view of iraq, iran and north korea as an "axis of evil." 11. foreign minister sergei ivanov told a global conference of government and military leaders that he sees no evidence that any of the three nations supports terrorism and insisted that any move against them must follow international law. italian defense minister antonio martino, meanwhile, said sunday that his country would not support an attack on iraq without "proven proof" that baghdad is supporting al qaeda, and iraqi leader saddam hussein dispatched a delegation to meet with european union leaders in spain. ivanov said the west uses a double standard in its definition of terrorism, asking why members of osama bin laden's al qaeda network are terrorists, but not chechen separatists fighting russia. a diverse u.s delegation delivered a singular message to conference participants: nato remains vital and the united states needs a range of allies in the fight against terrorism and intends to consult its friends. lindsey graham, r-s.c., asked ivanov why russia supported the former soviet republic of belarus with cheap energy subsidies, when the nation has "never had a democratic election and is a major exporter of arms and equipment." ivanov said there was no evidence belarus has sold arms to nations under sanction such as iraq, though it did do business with nations not under sanctions such as tajikistan, angola and "even gulf states."
