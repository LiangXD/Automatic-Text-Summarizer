even more proving rape chatterbox feels that the wall street journal editorial page's coverage of juanita broaddrick's rape charges against bill clinton (see proving rape , more proving rape, as well as michael kinsley's readme column in the current issue) cries out for the introduction of the scientific method into the usually mushy business of assessing press responsibility. they will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or internet posting after the first offense is noted by chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact--and an additional two points on days when the news organization runs a follow-up without making note of said inconvenient fact. for the purposes of this survey, the wall street journal will be counted as a separate and distinct publication from the journal 's editorial page, because, in essence, it is. the journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that norma kelsey, the friend and employee to juanita broaddrick who is one of two people partially corroborating broaddrick's rape accusation, is the daughter of a man whose murderer was pardoned by gov. chatterbox feels certain that the journal editorial page will provide some follow-up tomorrow to tonight's nbc broadcast of its own broaddrick interview, which means that if the journal editorial page continues to take no action it will be in the indis hall of fame by monday at the latest! when chatterbox asked the journal 's dc bureau chief, alan murray, who exercised good judgment in not breaking the broaddrick story (and--full disclosure-- is chatterbox's former boss), to comment about a journal employee's feeding sources to the times , he replied: i don't really have any comment on what the edit page did. for her part, rabinowitz explains to chatterbox that her efforts on behalf of the times were more indifferent than the times made them sound.
