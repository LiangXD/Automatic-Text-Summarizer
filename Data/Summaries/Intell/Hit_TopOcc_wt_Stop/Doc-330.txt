11 attacks on new york and washington, australia was one of the first countries to offer support for the us war against terrorism - pledging 1,500 troops to the afghan offensive. not only has australia's opposition labor party called for hicks, currently held at guantanamo bay, cuba, to be returned home, but a supreme court justice has described hicks as a casualty of his own government's attempt to maintain favor in washington. clearly, if it were not for our relations with the us, we would be protesting his continued imprisonment without proper trial, says justice john dowd, a former conservative attorney general who is also president of the australian chapter of the international commission of jurists. opposition justice spokesman darryl melham says the australian government's refusal to demand consular access to its citizen compares poorly with british foreign secretary jack straw's immediate insistence that three british nationals captured with al qaeda should face neither a military tribunal nor the death penalty. the americans seem to have retreated from an earlier position of the death penalty for foreigners, but we are still worried about the extent to which this guy's legal rights are being subjugated to the australian government's shuttle diplomacy with the us. mr. williams says neither the us nor australia is in a position to begin a prosecution against hicks, acknowledging that he may not have committed any offenses under australian law. no opinion polls have been taken, but talk radio, a popular medium that politicians use as a barometer of national opinion, is running slightly against him, according to the media monitoring agency rehame australia.
