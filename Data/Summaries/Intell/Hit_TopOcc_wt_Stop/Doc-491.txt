on thursday the arab summit in the lebanese capital of beirut ended with the adoption of a resolution whose content illustrated how far the arab world has come since the summit that took place in the sudanese capital of khartoum in 1967, shortly after the israeli victory in the six days war. on thursday the summit adopted a resolution that proposed the recognition of the jewish state, normal relations, and an end to the conflict in return for israeli withdrawal from the palestinian territories that israel has occupied for almost 35 years. the summit's declaration was the best piece of news the middle east has produced since the oslo accords between prime minister yitzhaq rabin and palestinian leader yasir arafat were signed on the lawn in front of the white house in washington in 1993. his name figured on a list that israel had shortly before handed over to the palestinian security service. as a first step israeli forces were sent into the main palestinian town, ramallah, where arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous palestinian areas are administered. israeli's antiterrorist operations must not bring the palestinian authority to collapse, israeli forces must not reconquer the territories under the jurisdiction of the authority, and arafat the man must not be molested. he demonstrated this he as defense minister during the 1982 invasion of lebanon, which led to arafat's being forced into exile in tunis.
