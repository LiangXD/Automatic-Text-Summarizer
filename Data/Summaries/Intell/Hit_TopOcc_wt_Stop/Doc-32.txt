diesel engine manufacturers have long maintained that these are harmless , but recently they have been found to contain polyaromatich hydrocarbons ( pah ) , which can cause cancer when breathed deeply. while many politicians have only recently seen their green light many diesel engine manufacturers have looked further ahead , and have been developing cleaner engines , principally in response to stringent american legislation. the result will be a common level of nox and particular emissions from vehicles ( measured in grammes per kilowat hour ) from vehicles sold in europe after 1991. there is also a further cut in the pipeline , but this second phase of diesel pollution is running into technical problems. unlike lead , which the fuel companies eventually proved only too pleased to take out_of petrol , sulphur does nothing for either the performance or longevity of diesel engines and it contributes to acid rain. however john bullock , retail fuels technical manager at shell uk , says the price of the fuel would rise significantly , because extra crude would have to be refined to run the hydro-desulphurisation process. there is , however , a chasm between what is becoming technically possible , and the reality of what is likely to happen to the air on our city streets , where , according_to friends of the earth , pollution levels regularly exceed who standards.
