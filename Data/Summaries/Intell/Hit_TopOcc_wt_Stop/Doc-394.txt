they have even demanded upgraded accommodations, seemingly forgetting that these are the leaders of a worldwide terrorist organization who have repeatedly vowed to kill innocent americans through war or terror. indeed, the evil-doers at camp x-ray are getting far better treatment than they deserve - hot showers, a warm caribbean climate and access to the exact same medical care as the military personnel who live on the base. indeed, since their arrival at camp-x-ray, some of the terrorists have openly threatened the marines who guard them and talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing the american people. at guantanamo bay, federal officials are conducting extensive interviews with the taliban and al qaeda terrorists, culling information on the terrorist network and the whereabouts and future plans of the tens of thousands of terrorists who were trained in the same camps and who are now living around the world. in the caves and hideouts of al qaeda operatives, we have found instruction books on how to build chemical and biological weapons, detailed maps of american cities and descriptions of landmarks. america's treatment of the taliban and al qaeda terrorists at camp x-ray is appropriate and, in my opinion, too good for these murderous thugs. instead of lecturing the united states, our critics may better spend their time reminding others that if terrorists don't want to be detained at camp x-ray, they should join the civilized world.
