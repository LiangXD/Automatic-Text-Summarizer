it retained, however, the same mission with which it had been charged from its inception: to serve as a catalyst for effective, coordinated, and collaborative service delivery to youth in our community. mccoy is actively represented and working with numerous community collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the inclusion of young people in both decision-making and program planning processes. since its re-organization, mccoy has established its unique niche within the community by refraining from direct service programming and focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs, and moving toward collaborative solutions. mccoy invites the support of the __ company foundation in the amount of $10,000.00 to support such activities as: ---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhood-based youth councils ---- the promotion of youth employment opportunities ---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery ---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youth-adult relationships ---- the development of community-wide supports for the positive growth of all marion county young people. in the last several years, the business and corporate community has recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to the development of a competent workforce. in our fund raising efforts to date, we have received the support of local government, foundations, and corporations as well as the personal financial commitments of individual mccoy board members. we believe there is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative effort to financially support the services mccoy offers to the community as a whole.
