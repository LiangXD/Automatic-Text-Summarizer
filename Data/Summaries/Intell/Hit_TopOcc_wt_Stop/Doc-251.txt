some lousy earnings reports whacked the stock market, but bond prices fell only slightly and the dollar rose a little against most major currencies. the dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen, but soared against the pound following the resignation of britain's chancellor of the exchequer, nigel lawson. the less-than-robust third-quarter results came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading. the number of stocks on the new york stock exchange that fell in price yesterday exceeded 1,000, a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical analysts. although the government said the economy grew an estimated 2.5% in the third quarter, in line with expectations, analysts are increasingly predicting much more sluggish growth -- and therefore more corporate earnings disappointments -- for the fourth quarter. there are a lot more downward revisions of earnings forecasts than upward revisions, said abby joseph cohen, a market strategist at drexel burnham lambert. while bond investors would have preferred growth to be a little slower, they were cheered by inflation measures in the data that showed prices rising at a modest annual rate of 2.9%.
