the un international conference on financing for development opened in monterrey on 18 march (telam photo) monterrey, mexico--choked, hushed voices, some of them astounded, are not guessing correctly about the dilemma of the chicken or the egg into which the argentine crisis has become converted, almost grotesquely: will the international monetary fund (imf) endorse concrete aid to the country, apart from the presumable good intentions of its board members and technicians, without the approval of george w. bush? eduardo duhalde's agenda, during his first departure from the country since he assumed the presidency, calls for a key meeting on friday with the imf's managing director, horst koehler, (which he will attend accompanied by economy minister jorge remes lenicov), and two occasions on which he will have the floor, addressing the world (for five minutes on one, and three minutes on the other) concerning the topic under discussion the monterrey consensus: or greater assistance from the developed countries to those that are underdeveloped, which in fact will be approved by consensus. more political than economic it is common knowledge, among most of the small groups, that the argentine crisis is more political than economic, and that, as one latin american diplomat accredited to the un remarked, the formula in question does not hold much mystery: a rapprochement with the united states is indispensable, because it is the only one that can extricate them from this. with a strategy that would permit duhalde, if he does not receive a clear signal from the imf, not to call for elections in 90 days, for example, and to become a lame duck, waiting for his successor, he explained. the source commented: argentine is in a position to be an alternative reference point for the united states, to the detriment of brazil which, in view of the internal and external vicissitudes facing fernando henrique cardoso, is, day by day, becoming somewhat weak. with 58 chief executives immersed in signing a document which, as la nacion was told by the argentine ambassador to the united nations, arnoldo listre, gives a clue to the direction in which we are heading: it shows a new organization in which the market economy is accepted as a fundamental factor for development and, unlike the cold war, is rid of the north-south confrontation. in that document, the monterrey consensus, free trade, the amendment on the distortion with agricultural subsidies, and the treatment of the external debt as fundamental pivotal points, benefit argentina.
