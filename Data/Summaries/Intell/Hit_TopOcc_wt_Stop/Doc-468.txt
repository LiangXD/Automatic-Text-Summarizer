in addition, they seek to convince other parties of these two ideas and are waiting for the concerned parties to agree to them, or, at least, to the first one, after which these two administrations will set their own conditions at the table. it is true that the palestinian towns are now under occupation, that the palestinian authority's institutions have been destroyed, and that arafat is still besieged at his office as a hostage. the zionists have succeeded in achieving these things, but a deep-rooted fact is that they have not succeeded, and will never succeed, in breaking the will of this valiant people or in forcing the palestinians into relinquishing their just, legitimate rights and ending their glorious struggle for these rights. it is thus an illusion for these criminal administrations to imagine that they have triumphed and that they are now in a position to dictate their own conditions on this great people. the conclusion to which we come is that the zionist and us administrations have aggravated the zionist entity's historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that force can break the palestinian people's will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose. contrary to the visible scene and to the illusion of sharon and bush, this zionist-us crime has confirmed that the zionist entity's historical impasse is constantly aggravating and that the arabs' recognition of this entity's right to exist is now more distant than before despite some official arab recognitions. millions of arabs, palestinians and non-palestinians alike, now have a conviction stronger than before to the effect that it is impossible to achieve coexistence with this usurping, occupying, aggressive, and racist entity.
