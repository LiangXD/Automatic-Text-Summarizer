plunged into chaos by looting and deadly riots that forced fernando de la rua to resign as president a week ago, argentina fell deeper into anarchy when interim leader adolfo rodriguez saa quit on sunday after losing his party's support. but bickering politicians agreed the crisis was too serious to subject argentina to the pressure of quick elections, which had been scheduled for march, and decided yesterday to choose an interim leader to rule until 2003, when de la rua's mandate was to end. landed with the provisional presidency for 48 hours, the head of the lower house of congress, eduardo camano, called on senators and deputies to hold a legislative assembly today which should rubber-stamp duhalde's appointment. with new year celebrations canceled for fear of violence in the worst crisis since the country's last military coup in 1976, security chief juan jose alvarez said the capital had been strongly reinforced with patrols by the federal police, the coast guard and the border police. but despite the heavy guard on the president's pink palace and the plaza de mayo outside, there were no rumblings of intervention by the military which has been subordinate to civilian rule since 1983. while the moratorium on part of argentina's $132-billion public debt, heralding the biggest default in history, had long been expected by markets that have dumped argentine bonds this year, rodriguez saa's plans for a new currency caused alarm. he had planned to alleviate the cash crunch by minting the argentino to circulate alongside pesos, which have been backed up and pegged one-to-one to u.s. dollars for a decade, providing monetary stability and zero inflation.
