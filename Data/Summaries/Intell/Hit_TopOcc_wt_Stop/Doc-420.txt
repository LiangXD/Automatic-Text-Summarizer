my sheik, here's some of the events that happened in ramadi: 1- sheik nasr al-fahdawi, sheik of albufahd tribe, was nominated to be the governor of anbar, this man worked so hard fighting the (tanzim)organization, with all he's got, from money to power, and reputation in ramadi, so we tried this @ with him: first, we backed off during the elections, they had checkpoints, using tens of his tribesmen who started checking cars, they violated our brothers many times, they even announced it, then our brothers attacked the field leader, the brain behind people revolting at al-anbar in albufahd, so the brothers raided his house in the middle of the night wearing the national guards uniform and driving similar cars, they took him and killed him thank god. 2- sheik of albu'ubaid (salah al-dhari), who slaughtered thirty sheeps in one dinner party, where he invited heads and sheiks of tribes in ramadi, to encourage their youth to join the police and the national guard, and that's two days before the murder of sheik nasr al-fahdawi, after that he announced his repentance at the mosque twice infront of albu'ubaid tribe, denouncing who joins the police and army, and sorry for all he's done, without any pressure or threats from the brothers, also the brothers didn't announce the claim for any of the killings. sheik muhammad saddak said himself that he's nominated for the position of the interior minister, and sheik nasr al- fahdawi for the governor of anbar, like the americans promised him, and abu raghghal al-dulaymi and others thank god, his was eliminated by the brothers inside the city of baghdad, until now no one knows who killed him in baghdad, with all that, our policy is to eliminate the heads of infidelity without any announcements. as for the heads of the islamic party, our brothers been monitoring them for so long, but ignored them during the elections, then their vicious role appeared, with their call to form police and army after the elections, we found that the main thinker behind the party's ideas is sheik abd al-ghafur al-kubaysi the imam and speaker of of al-shafi'i mosque in ramadi, and made his mosque the center of all the party's meetings, with all that, he didn't stop fighting the brothers with his speeches at the mosque, so the brothers assasinated him near his house, after he left the mosque going home, and there was no reaction by the islamic party or people, except that they raised signs condemning the killing. other groups pretends that they never killed an iraqi or sunni in particular, and that its goals are patriotic, what we know about our jihad, that it's jihad of faith, and what you stated over and over before my sheik about the method of the group, and the honorable resistance in many of the speeches to our brothers and people, in fact sheik we are joyous for forming the state council, although we say, to save this blessed work, which we pray to god that islam and muslims would benefit from it, everyone should agree on our policy in the war against the renegade, without these restrictions we have at the state council. we have no problem with you saying for us to give the name of the person before killing him, but we owe god, this will only be a delay for us, and time is not on our side, and for you to say to kill him outside his city, sometimes it take months before the person leaves his city, like if it's in baghdad for example, that's difficult, and time is not on our side, we waited to cut the heads of the renegades in hit, then 130 renegades came out to us for the reason that we didn't destroy the islamic party there, but we're working on it, for example we didn't kill nasr al-fahdawi at his home in al-sajriyah, but the guys waited for him until he got out of the ramadi province. 13- priority in killing those who are damaging to us and mulims, before the ones who are not. </lu_annotate wc=384> with stating this to you, we know your intend, whenever we meet with you, you tell us that this is the right way, but we want this in writing by the state council, so all of our members would observe it, but if it's not writtin it will go away after you're gone, if you die of get killed, the council after you inshallh (in god's well) will stay on good grounds, where the fate of an entire nation depends on it, god is the protector of his religion, let's have a big role in it, we ask god to keep us guided not lost.
