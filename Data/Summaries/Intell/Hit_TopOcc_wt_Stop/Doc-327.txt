the suspension from the 54-nation group was described by john howard, the australian prime minister, as being at the more severe end... of the options available to us and matches the penalties previously imposed on pakistan and fiji for not observing basic democratic principles. within the commonwealth, australia, new zealand and britain led a move to suspend the country, but that was resisted by african and caribbean countries, threatening to split the group along racial lines. though zimbabwe's harshest critics had argued the country should be suspended before the elections, african countries, supported by mr. chretien, took a wait-and-see attitude, setting up the three-member committee to make a final determination after the election. election observers reported thousands of voters were not given the chance to cast ballots in the election, while others were intimidated into voting for mr. mugabe's governing zanu-pf party. mr. tsvangirai, who has been charged with treason for allegedly plotting to assassinate mr. mugabe, offered to hold talks with the president in an attempt to end two years of violence. canada must push for punitive action against mr. mugabe and his band of thugs that have brutalized the people of zimbabwe, which means an indefinite suspension from the commonwealth, a ban on travel for mugabe's cronies and to freeze their personal assets. mr. mugabe, 78, led zimbabwe to independence from britain in 1980 and ruled a country that was seen as a great hope for prosperity until the last few years, when the economy has collapsed.
