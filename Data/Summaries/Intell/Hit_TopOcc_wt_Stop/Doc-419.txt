naturally, i start crying, and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me, either my stomach, or that i had a headache, or something was wrong with my leg. so after she noticed that i was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family. and the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table. so she said, little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like i asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you. my husband became very ill with cancer and i had to make a decision as to whether i would continue my education or take care of him and i felt like i needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while i was going to school. i guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that i was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence. so i worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that i was taking care of a very sick husband.
