i can tell you we need your help now as much as ever before. all of our six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity (and, truth be told, with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed in) and we have a waiting list of 60 children who are hoping to come if a spot should open. it seems summer options aren't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes, so we're doing all we can to make jameson available. two of them told me yesterday that as a group they decided they had to earn the right to ask others for help by accomplishing something real to help themselves. even after the summer sessions come to a close, jameson campers will take part in year-round programs designed to keep that positive contact with peers and role models alive and important. please, consider renewing your support of these great kids today. if you can give a little more to help meet this increased expense we would appreciate your support.
