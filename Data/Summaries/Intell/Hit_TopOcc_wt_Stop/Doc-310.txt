president daniel arap moi of kenya congratulated mugabe, calling his victory testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of zimbabwe hold in you. the climate of insecurity obtaining in zimbabwe since the 2000 parliamentary elections was such that the electoral process could not be said to adequately comply with the norms and standards for elections in the sadc region, the forum said in a statement. that position chimed closely with views expressed by the main zimbabwean monitoring group, the zimbabwe election support network which had 400 observers monitoring the poll and have been heavily critical. norway prime minister jan petersen said in a statement that the presidential election in zimbabwe has not satisfied the fundamental requirements for a democratic election. the mdc leader said systematic cheating, spoiling tactics, rigid new laws and sheer obstruction - as well as political violence and intimidation - were just some of the irregularities practised by the authorities in the run-up to, and during the poll. jack straw, the foreign secretary of the former colonial power, britain, which is locked in a verbal war with mugabe, said the zimbabwean head of state was bent on achieving one goal, power at all costs. if the people of zimbabwe have a sense that they have been cheated through the election process, it is possible that some could resort to violence, said the foreign minister, alexander downer.
