risa maeda tokyo 1997-03-31 the bank of japan ( boj ) may continue to let japanese short-term money rates to fluctuate widely after april 1 to remind the market of the risk of relying too much on overnight money , analysts said on monday. financial institutions were inclined to raise funds at the short-end of the market on the belief that the boj will stick to its nearly 19-month-old committment to keep the average of the key overnight rate below its base rate to support japan's fragile economic recovery. for_example , analysts said , a sudden rise to 0.58 percent in the key overnight call rate on march 24 , when many banks suffered from paying more than they expected , was seen as planned. the rate was at 0.53 percent on the previous day. _ by allowing the key overnight rate to rise sharply , the boj at that time let market participants know that they should take a liquidity risk as long as they rely on the overnight money , _ said shoji kitta , president of totan research co. _ also , if the boj leaves the current upward bias in the key overnight rate after april , which is highly likely , that may encourage banks to use longer-term transactions and lessen settlement risks in trading overnight money , _ he said. but the key overnight rate was boosted to 0.85 percent by some banks which were in great need of overnight money after failing to raise enough longer-term funds covering the fiscal year-end , bankers said. the central bank has since december gathered ideas from the financial institutions based in tokyo on the rtgs system , in which transactions are settled instantly on a real-time basis through the accounts that they have at the boj. the boj has said the financial firms' efforts to reduce reliance on overnight call money and do more longer-term transactions is necessary for an introduction of the rtgs.
