mr. de la r?resignation will put the country's immediate future in the hands of the moderate opposition party that controls congress and had recently begun blocking many of the former president's policies. but congress can change that, and how it will play its hand will be largely left to opposition leaders, including a former president, carlos sa?nem, and senator eduardo duhalde, who lost to mr. de la r? the 1999 elections. mr. de la r?government collapsed with surprising rapidity, as the police fired shotguns at demonstrators in front of his palace, tear gas seeped into presidential offices and fires filled the grand boulevards and avenues of buenos aires with towers of black smoke. thousands of demonstrators massed and set bonfires in front of the congress and presidential palace throughout the day, until riot police, including some on horseback, stormed through the crowds this afternoon clubbing people while reinforcements fired water cannon and rubber bullets. but his assumption of emergency powers appeared only to incite greater protests, beginning with an outpouring of thousands of people wednesday night onto the streets of buenos aires, banging pots and pans and demanding mr. de la r?resignation. mr. de la r?decline began in october 2000 with the resignation of his vice president, carlos alvarez, over the government's handling of charges that bribes were paid to opposition senators to pass a new labor law. then, in october, his coalition suffered a devastating defeat in legislative elections that gave the opposition control of both houses of congress.
