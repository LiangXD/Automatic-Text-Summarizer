a cluster of at least 20 boats of the separatist liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte) mounted the pre-dawn attack on the mv pride of south off the island's point pedro coast, ministry spokesman sanath karunaratne said. he said navy gunboats and helicopter gunships repulsed the initial attack and first reports indicated at least two rebel craft had been blown out of the water. fighting continued two hours after the initial exchange of fire in high seas and the navy had called in more gun ships to beat back the guerrillas, karunaratne said. hours before the ferry incident, a navy fast attack craft encountered an explosive-laden boat which blew up in an apparent tamil tiger suicide mission, karunaratne said. all three people onboard that boat evaporated, indicating that it was packed with explosives to ram against the navy fast attack craft, karunaratne said. in september 1999, the sri lankan navy fought tiger rebel boats off the island's northeastern coast to prevent the guerrillas from seizing a chinese merchant vessel. a tiger flotilla had been moving towards the 14,000-tonne mv yugi when it was confronted by navy gun boats, the defence ministry said at the time, adding that the 32 crew members had not been hurt.
