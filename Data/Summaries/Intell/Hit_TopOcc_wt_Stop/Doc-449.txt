to help them establish themselves in the community, the pleasant run emancipation fund was begun in 1993 by private donors who wanted to provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our programs. individuals who are being emancipated are eligible to receive up to $500 from the fund if they formally apply and meet four requirements: 1. positive termination of his or her pleasant run program 4. possession of a high school diploma or ged proof of meeting these, two staff reference letters and an essay stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all reviewed by a pleasant run panel, which determines if the applicant merits the funds. such fund are often used for college tuition, vocational training or a deposit on an apartment. because pleasant run is the only family for so many, our emancipation fund is one way we can help a young person take the first steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive adult. please take a few minutes to send a donation to help one or more of our children successfully cross that threshold into the future.
