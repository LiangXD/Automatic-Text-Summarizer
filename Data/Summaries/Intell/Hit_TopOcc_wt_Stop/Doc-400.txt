washington: unprecedented scepticism and scorn accompanied the release by the united states on monday of its annual human rights report amid charges of hypocrisy and double standards arising from the ongoing war on terrorism. washington's kid glove treatment of its so-called allies such as saudi arabia and pakistan came up for withering scrutiny at a briefing to release the 2001 country reports on human rights practices, an annual administrative exercise mandated by the congress that many feel has increasingly become a meaningless ritual. amid widespread domestic criticism over curtailment of civil liberties, us officials laboured to convince a disbelieving press corps that the exercise was evenhanded. critics in the media sharply questioned such duplicity at monday's briefing as lorne cramer, us assistant secretary for democracy, human rights, and labour, struggled to defend american policy. what is it that we are doing in saudi arabia to promote that greater voice and greater democratic participation? and when you say we're talking to the government of saudi arabia, are we talking to them about starting such programs up, or are we just simply mentioning that they have a human rights problem? q: because other administrations told us that they've talked to the saudis about human rights and democracy issues, participation in women's rights and all of it.
