american delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale, possession, and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [as published] of american citizens, and equal to reducing their margin of security. (it should be noted that the issues moved at the conference were declared unofficial and lacking validity [legal force] even for the participating countries.) [sentences are as published] it can safely be claimed that the events in genoa have influenced [overshadowed] the very conferences in new york and bonn whereas, from the onset, the weak results of genoa was foreseeable for most observers. in the remarks made by these political leaders, one point is interesting and calls for reflection: if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations, while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them, then it must be said that they are only the elected [leaders] of their own nation [people], and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide! [exclamation mark as published] in view of the criticisms, which have been made, they could perhaps be also considered to be the representative of powerful corporations that have placed the whole world economy under their influence, and as a result of that they are also controlling the world of politics globally. it was due to this isolation that america, in spite of discrediting [undermining] the kyoto protocol and declining to comply with the bonn conference [resolution], was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution. to recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of new york and genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely.
