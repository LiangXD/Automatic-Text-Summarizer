kinshasa, july 14 (afp) - some 60 representatives of civil society, parties, rebel groups and government in the democratic republic of congo (drc) are to take part in preparatory talks on reviving political dialogue in the vast country next month, an official said saturday. the round of consultations ahead of the start of formal negotiations between the various parties -- dubbed the inter-congolese dialogue -- will begin august 20 in the botswana capital gaborone, the facilitator of the talks, former botswana president ketumile masire, announced this week. masire's team, which has criss-crossed the former zaire to prepare for the talks, is currently pursuing its mission in the provinces of bandundu, bas-congo, equateur, and in the capital kinshasa, lebatt said. masire said this week he was determined to ensure that people from all corners of the country are allowed to express their views , adding that he wanted to avoid a superficial exercise. the national dialogue is a feature of peace accords signed in 1999 by all warring parties in the former zaire -- two rebel groups, their backers rwanda and uganda, and the kinshasa government and its allies, angola, zimbabwe and namibia. masire was brought back into the drc peace process in february this year as facilitator for the inter-congolese dialogue by president joseph kabila. the political players must overcome their divisions by finding a formula for consensus, said lebatt, who is former foreign and cooperation minister of mauritania.
