but it was still a healthy rise from the level of 17,303.65 on january 10 when fears mounted that sharp stock price falls may force japanese banks to postpone their problem loan write-offs or post losses. while japan's top 20 banks must take appraisal losses worth about 1.7 trillion yen ( $13.7 billion ) on shareholdings in 1996/97 , it is unlikely that many will fall into the red , industry analysts said. posting losses cuts a bank's capital cushion and reduces capital adequacy ratios set by the bank for international settlements ( bis ) , further undermining the already-tainted credibility of japanese banks. analysts said the top 20 banks would stick to their plans to dispose of about 5.0 trillion yen ( $40.3 billion ) worth of problem loans for 1996/97 despite the appraisal losses. thanks_to declines in market interest rates , operating profits at big banks are estimated to be about 10 percent larger than the 4.0 trillion yen ( $32.3 billion ) the banks had forecast for 1996/97. yukiko ohara , analyst at ubs securities ltd , said she expects some big banks to unveil drastic problem loan disposal plans in 1997/98 as japan will introduce new capital adequacy standards , known as the prompt corrective action ( pca ) system , in april next year. according_to the finance ministry , japan's deposit-taking financial institutions had 29 trillion yen ( $233 billion ) worth of problem loans at the end of last september.
