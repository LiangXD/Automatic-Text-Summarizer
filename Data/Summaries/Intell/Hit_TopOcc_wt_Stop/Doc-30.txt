slow progress in the war on diabetes : nicholas russell says investigative research may beat flashy technology by nicholas russell one in 50 britons suffers from sugar diabetes and , despite 100 years of scientific study , we still do not know how it is caused. normal individuals maintain the concentration of blood sugar at a constant level by their own insulin , which causes cells in muscle , liver and fatty tissue ? target cells ? to take up excess circulating sugar and store it. either no insulin is produced ( type 1 diabetes ) or the muscle , liver and fat cells fail to respond to insulin ( type 2 ). with astonishing speed , in the era before regulation of new drugs , lilly developed systems for extracting pork and beef insulin from slaughterhouse offal. most diabetes is the type 2 form , in which the patient still generates insulin , but the body '_ s target cells fail to respond to it. in both cases it seems that the problem lay in the transmission of the activation signal across the target cell membrane , once insulin has bound to the surface receptor. analysis of cells from these rats showed that drug action had interfered with the expression of genes for some of the proteins designed to move sugar into muscle and fat cells , exactly the target tissues which must be stimulated by insulin if they are to take up excess sugar.
