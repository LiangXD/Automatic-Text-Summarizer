we often hear about economic poverty, but what some of these young people are growing up with is emotional poverty-they have often given up on hope and the possibility of a successful future. thanks to our big sisters volunteers, these young people are self-confident, believe in themselves and are beginning to realize their full potential. a recent study bypositive public/private ventures (ppv) showed that girls who had a big sister for just one year: reduced first-time drug use by 46% lowered school absenteeism by 52% cut violent behavior by 33% enhanced school performance showed improved peer and family relationships former little sister amy, now 18-years old, is a testament to the big sisters program. will you make a financial gift to big sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the guidance they need, that more young people stay in school, stay off drugs and make good choices? it will also be used to help maintain the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships, including volunteer orientation and training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff. gifts of $100 or more will be matched thanks to a special 25th anniversary $100,000 challenge grant and will be placed in the growth for girls fund. if you would like to find out more about the big sisters program, please call us, (317) 634-6102 and ask for ellen robinson.
