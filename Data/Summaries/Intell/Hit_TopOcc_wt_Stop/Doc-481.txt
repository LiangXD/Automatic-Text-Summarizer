caracas (afp) -- the venezuelan military high command maintains its support for president hugo chavez despite calls from the opposition to take part in an indefinite general strike declared wednesday night [10 april], and despite the individual acts of insubordination of two generals on that same day, one of them in command of no troops. he was followed by division general rafael damiani, from the militarized national guard (gn), who condemned the fact that president chavez ordered troops to use force in putting down a demonstration in caracas in support of the striking managers of the state-owned pdvsa [venezuelan petroleum, inc.]. on tuesday, the inspector general of the armed forces, general lucas rincon, accompanied civil defense minister jose vicente rangel and energy minister alvaro silva calderon in a tour of the strategic oil facilities of the state-owned pdvsa, whose managers are completing their seventh day of the strike that paralyzed refining operations and shipments of fuel. luis alberto camacho, deputy minister of citizen security, reported that 22,000 members of the national guard, one of the components of the armed forces, have been deployed throughout the country in order to safeguard individuals and property during the general strike. general gonzalez, who reviewed the venezuelan-colombian border conflict, accused chavez of lying when he stated that the colombian guerrillas are not entering venezuelan territory and contradicted him: they are indeed entering and have been fought militarily by troops from this country. damiani, an official on active duty, said he had revealed the information in order to try to impede this action resulting from a presidential folly that will sully the name of the armed forces and especially the national guard. however, datanalisis analyst leon indicated that even though chavez still controls the military forces at the present time, this fact constitutes no permanent life insurance, since the current indefinite general strike called by the opposition ctv and the fedecamaras [venezuelan federation of associations and chambers of commerce and industry] leadership is only one battle in a war that he predicts will be a long one.
