so we still have a way to go before our economic crisis reaches argentine proportions, but there is little doubt that unless drastic measures are taken, we are on the way. based on false premises regarding anticipated government revenues and underestimates of the need for defense expenditures, a totally unrealistic budget was prepared. at the same time, there was no let-up in his continuing battle with the governor of the bank of israel, who is supposed to be his partner in managing israel's economy. plans for a law that would restrict the authority of the governor were ill-received in the international financial community and seem to have been dropped for the time being. the emergency economic plan is in the process of being torn to bits by the many political interest groups whose constituencies will be affected by the plan. it should be clear that the problem israel is facing at this time has much more than just an economic dimension. but successful management of the economy - the second front - is essential so that the resources needed for defense needs can be made available without causing serious damage to the economy. @ copyright 2002 ha'aretz.
