perhaps because jerusalem was in neutral territory not allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of israel, david made it the capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented artisans, dedicated priests, magical poets and musicians, and the most formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city. according to biblical tradition, although david bought the land for the temple and carefully assembled its building materials, he was deemed unworthy of constructing the temple because he was a man of war with blood on his hands. but with his death the empire collapsed, and the israelite kingdom was divided into two separate, impoverished, often warring nations: israel, with its capital at shechem in the north, ruled by a series of northern dynasties and the smaller kingdom of judah, with its capital at jerusalem, from which the davidic dynasty continued to rule. the courtyard around the temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of pilgrims, and the temple mount was shored up by retaining walls made with great stone blocks. in 1947 the united nations voted for the partition of palestine into two states, one jewish and one arab, with jerusalem as an international city that belonged to neither. west jerusalem, separated from the rest of the new jewish nation, held out under siege for several months until israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the coastal areas. however, with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire, no israeli or jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the western wall or other jewish sites in east jerusalem.
