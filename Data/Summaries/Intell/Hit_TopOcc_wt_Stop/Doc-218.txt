as israeli tanks push their way into one palestinian population center after another it has become more and more difficult to guess what political objectives might be driving prime minister ariel sharon. the desperate tableau that has emerged in the last few days is becoming even more dismal, and the administration of president george w. bush does not appear to have any sort of logical near east policy. israeli's own 35-year-old occupation and resettlement policies have created the breeding ground for the terrorism that sharon is now trying to root out by resorting exclusively to military means. the high birthrate of the palestinian population guarantees that it will not be possible to change the population balance of the occupied territories by stepping up resettlement [by the jewish population]. terrorism will not be absent from such a country and, in the process, israel will lose the right to count itself among the world's democracies. the other alternative entails the massive expulsion of the three million palestinians to neighboring countries with the human and political catastrophe that would accompany this. sharon, of course, will not admit that he is planning anything like this, even though the idea has been discussed in israel.
