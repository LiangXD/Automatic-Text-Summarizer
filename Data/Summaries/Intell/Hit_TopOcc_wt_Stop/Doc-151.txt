as a result, the costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth. fourth is the contrast between the benchmark covenants' relative emissions standards and the belgian government's absolute restrictions on emissions within the framework of the kyoto protocol. if industrial greenhouse gas emissions increase considerably over the next 10 years, that will have to be offset by a commensurate reduction of emissions in the transport sector, services, households, and so forth. this european proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the flemish benchmark covenants. companies could be allocated rights on the basis of an energy efficiency standard, on the condition that they are prepared to accept an absolute emissions ceiling. however, if they wish to emit more (because, for instance, their output is increasing considerably), they can do so provided that they purchase the necessary emission rights from companies which have a surplus of rights. only a division that takes account of every sector's possibilities and is borne by the various target groups guarantees that belgium will achieve its kyoto aims without draconian measures having to be adopted at the eleventh hour.
