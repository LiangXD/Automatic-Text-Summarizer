lawrence sheets tbilisi 1997-03-31 georgian president eduard shevardnadze on monday hailed a decision by the commonwealth of independent states to extend russia's peacekeeping role in breakaway abkhazia , but separatists there poured scorn on it. shevardnadze said cis leaders had agreed in moscow on friday that a 24-km ( 15-mile ) wide zone along the de_facto border between georgia and abkhazia would be extended several km ( miles ) deeper into the independence-minded region. a bold example of this is that there is the real prospect that ( some of ) the population can return to ( abkhazia ) , _ shevardnadze said in his weekly radio address. shevardnadze had said last week that the peacekeepers would have to leave if russia did not give georgia , devastated by civil and ethnic conflict since it became independent in 1991 , more help in restoring control over abkhazia. the speaker of the abkhaz parliament , sokrat dzhindzholia , told interfax news agency the move was _ adopted without taking into account abkhazia's opinion , one-sided and repressive. _ comments: i don't want to mark this sentence as important, but it is needed as it provides the referent for dzhindzholia in other marked sentences. he said abkhazia might insist that the contingent is removed entirely and that he did not fear a new georgian offensive. _ the armed forces of the republic are capable of independently guaranteeing it_ 's security , _ he told interfax. but russia , facing its own separatist rebellion in the north caucasus region of chechnya and fearing a _ domino effect _ in other regions , now broadly supports georgia over abkhazia and helps enforce a partial economic blockade of the province.
