japan, u.s. differ over global warming issues japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and visiting u.s. president george w. bush differed over the kyoto protocol and how to prevent global warming but agreed to cooperate on that issue. bush repeated his rejection of the 1997 kyoto protocol aimed atcurbing global warming, and pushed for the alternative he announced last week. it is for the u.s. to decide whether to take part in the protocol or not, but i hope we will continue with our efforts so we can move in the same direction, said koizumi, who supports thekyoto protocol. the u.s. president announced an alternative proposal last week,calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies in accordance with economic growth instead of mandatory reduction targets presented in the kyoto pact. the proposal is criticized by environmentalists as ineffective for solving global warming and warn that under the plan u.s. greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise. in monday's summit talks, bush and koizumi agreed to cooperate together with other countries, including developing nations, on the issue of global warming. japan and the u.s. can cooperate over the development of new technologies in the field and that such technologies will help notonly the environment but also economic development, they agreed.
