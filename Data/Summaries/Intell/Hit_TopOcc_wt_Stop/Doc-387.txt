one soldier handles a captive like a mannequin - moving him back, forward, and to the side - before lifting him straight off his feet and onto one of two waiting buses. 11. when the detainees arrive at camp x-ray, they are told they're in cuba and then undergo a 45-minute intake process, which, like the airstrip landing, is monitored by the red cross. they get a toothbrush, mint-flavored toothpaste, a bottle of lively salon antidandruff shampoo, soap, flip flops, a foam sleeping mat, two buckets, a washcloth, a canteen, a prayer cap, two blankets, a sheet, a koran and two towels, one for praying. except for an occasional spitting incident or threat, officials say, the prisoners are docile. the growth of the base has left camp x-ray surprisingly close to a suburban-style military community of beige, green and yellow houses in subdivisions with names like caribbean circle and west iguana. the medical staff relies on linguists to help communicate with the patients, but they've also come up with their own inventions, such as a longhand list of english phrases and their arabic counterparts. while calm has returned to fleet hospital 20, officials elsewhere on the base are bracing for what they say may be inevitable: the death of one of the detainees.
