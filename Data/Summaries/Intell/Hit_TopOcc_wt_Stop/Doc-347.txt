beijing: china on thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the united states and taiwan, demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to us weapons sales. the continual sale of arms by the united states or upgrading of relations with taiwan will only lead to tensions across the straits, foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said. zhang further expressed alarm over washington's announcement on wednesday that defense department officials will soon visit taiwan to discuss the sale of eight diesel electric submarines. china has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the united states and taiwan, zhang said. the taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive issue at the core of sino-us relations, she said at the biweekly ministry briefing. beijing has also long refused to establish diplomatic relations with any nation that maintains official contact with taiwan, although it has encouraged economic exchanges between taiwan and all nations. zhang said: the remarks of the us official are a... violation of us commitments made (on taiwan) and interference in china internal affairs.
