it will discuss the bills on euthanasia and palliative care that the senate approved in the autumn of 2001. ever since then, the senate's work has been subject to increasing criticisms, including from groups that support a possible law on euthanasia. the criticisms mainly focus on the applicability of the senate's bill, the lack of a palliative filter prior to committing euthanasia, the supervisory role of the assessment committee, which is likely to be understaffed, and the nonexistence of fixed penalties for unjustifiable cases of euthanasia. the chamber's health, environment, and social emancipation committee will only have an advisory role. according to the cd&amp amp v [christian democratic and flemish], this is why this committee has only been given an advisory function. this committee is scheduled to start the debate on the senate's euthanasia bill today. the chamber apparently wants to push ahead with the debate on euthanasia because available speaking time is very limited.
