the issue has come to a boil in newark, n.j., where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for eddie antar that if the founder and former chairman of crazy eddie inc. is indicted, the government may move to seize the money that mr. antar is using to pay legal fees. if the government succeeds in seizing mr. antar's assets, he could be left without top-flight legal representation, because his attorneys are likely to quit, according to individuals familiar with the case. mr. antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in newark, where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges. according to individuals familiar with mr. antar's case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of mr. antar's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure. in a letter, prosecutors told mr. antar's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized. prosecutors have told mr. antar's attorneys that they believe mr. antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities. still, criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their sixth amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers' fees.
