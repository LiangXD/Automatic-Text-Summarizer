The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez Washington Times April 25, 2002 Pg. 18 The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez In Venezuela, the dust is finally settling after the dramatic turbulence of the past two weeks.

Their loved ones were gunned down, first by sympathizers of Mr. Chavez and subsequently by supporters of the short-lived interim government. Mr. Chavez was ousted in a military coup on April 12 after 17 persons were killed during an anti-Chavez protest, apparently by sharpshooters faithful to the president. At a time when democracy is losing currency in many countries, particularly Argentina, coups could be potentially destabilizing to the region.
