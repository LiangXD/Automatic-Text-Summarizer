The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has been strongly criticized and condemned by many countries. Recently, the Information Office of the Chinese People's Congress released a report on human rights in the United States in 2001, criticizing violations of human rights there. Evidence show that human rights violations in the United States have been ignored for many years. The United States has been preparing annual reports on human rights in 190 countries for 25 years while ignoring the real situation at home. The British News Agency Reuters remarked that in the 2000 human rights report, the United States criticized Egypt for trying suspected terrorists in military courts. In light of the United States' malicious goals, its Annual Human Rights Report for 2001 is facing strong protest and criticism from the world. The Annual Human Rights Report released by the US State Department is not convincing as it is inaccurate and fabricated.
