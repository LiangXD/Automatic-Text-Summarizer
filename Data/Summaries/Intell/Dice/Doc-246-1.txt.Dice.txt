Marshall Schwarz was named chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Trust Corp., a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $17 billion. Mr. Schwarz, 52 years old, will succeed Daniel P. Davison Feb. Mr. Schwarz, who is president of U.S. Trust will be succeeded in that post by Jeffrey S. Maurer, 42, who is executive vice president in charge of the company's asset-management group. U.S. Trust a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the U.S., has faced intensifying competition from other firms that have established, and heavily promoted, private-banking businesses of their own. But Mr. Schwarz welcomes the competition in U.S. Trust's flagship businesses, calling it flattery. We have always taken smaller accounts, but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow, Mr. Schwarz says. The new services allow U.S. Trust to cater to the new wealth, Mr. Schwarz says. We will have a reasonably flat year this year, Mr. Schwarz says. Mr. Schwarz's father was a U.S. Trust trustee until 1974. U.S. Trust also created a four-member office of the chairman, effective Feb. Donald M. Roberts, 54, treasurer, and Frederick S. Wonham, 58, who takes responsibility for the funds-service group, were named vice chairmen and will serve in the office of the chairman.
