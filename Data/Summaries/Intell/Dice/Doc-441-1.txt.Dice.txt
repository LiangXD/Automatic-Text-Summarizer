We've worked hard to structrue the organization so that we've ready to move boldly into the next century, and I believe that we have an exciting and successful future ahead of us. Where else would that many people turn if CCI weren't there to help? The community initiatives committee is working with our development office to put together a long-range fundraising plan that will ultimately bring more money into our centers. I also encourage you to seek additional support through your company, church, or service organization. Your financial support of the development process is just one step in making CCI a stronger, more efficient and ultimately more effective federation of service providers.
