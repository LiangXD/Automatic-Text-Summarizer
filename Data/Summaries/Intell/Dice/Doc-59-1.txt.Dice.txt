SINGAPORE : Jurong , SembCorp finalise merger. Angela Tan SINGAPORE 1997-03-31 Sembawang Corp Ltd ( Sembcorp ) and Jurong Shipyard Ltd said on Monday they had completed negotiations on a proposed merger to create one of the world's largest shiprepair firms. _ Our aim is to combine our market share and knock out the competition permanently , _ said chairman of SembCorp , Philip Yeo at a news conference. _ The merger will be our answer to the direct competition from the Middle East. _ Combined , they have slightly more than 50 percent of the Singapore market and will have a total of nine dry docks , including three Very Large Crude Carrier-sized docks , Yeo said. Under the revised proposal , SembCorp will inject only its shipyard businesses , excluding some parts like its loss-making offshore engineering operations. The merger , which needs the approval of shareholders and the Stock Exchange of Singapore , is expected to be sealed by the third quarter of 1997 , company officials said. The merger will result in SembCorp's stake in Jurong rising to 38.6 percent from 23.4 percent and will trigger a mandatory general offer for the rest of Jurong shares. _ Our aim is to get as much as we can and leave enough shares in the public for trading , _ Yeo said when asked how many Jurong shares SembCorp was interested in acquiring. Jurong chairman Lua Cheng Eng , who will be chairman of the merged company , said the merger would allow Jurong to compete more effectively by offering more cost-effective services. SembCorp shares ended down S$0.45 at S$6.95 on Monday. $-- Singapore newsroom ( 65 8703083 )
