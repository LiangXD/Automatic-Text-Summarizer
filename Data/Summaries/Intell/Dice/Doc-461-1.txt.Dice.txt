Geneva, May 10 (XINHUA) -- The insurer Swiss Life has pulled the plug on its planned expansion in China, preferring to concentrate on its core European markets, according to a report by Swiss Radio International (SRI). A spokeswoman said the insurer did not have a license to sell life insurance in China. The Chinese insurance market grew 40 percent in 2001.
