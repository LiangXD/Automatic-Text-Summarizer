Bradley Perrett CANBERRA 1996-08-21 Australia's new conservative government on Wednesday began selling its tough deficit-slashing budget , which sparked violent protests by Aborigines , unions , students and welfare groups even before it was announced. Two days of anti-budget street protests preceded spending cuts officially unveiled by Treasurer Peter Costello. _ This is a once-in-a-decade chance to get it right , _ Costello said in a radio interview. _ If we do_ n't do it now , Australia is going to be in deficit and debt into the next century. _ Tuesday's budget sliced A$4 billion ( US$3.1 billion ) from the budget for the current fiscal year , to June 1997 , as a first instalment towards an underlying surplus ( excluding asset sales ) by 1998/99. As the protesters had feared , Costello revealed a cut to the government's Aboriginal welfare commission among the hundreds of measures implemented to claw back the deficit. The head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions , Jennie George , told reporters the budget hurt the weakest groups in the community and did nothing to solve Australia's high unemployment rate $- now 8.5 percent. _ The scenario for unemployment is very bleak indeed , _ George said. The cuts , many of which had been disclosed ahead_of the budget , have sparked protests around the country and triggered rioting during a protest by unionists , students , Aborigines and welfare groups at Parliament House on Monday. But financial markets , which had been expecting a lower deficit were lukewarm. _ It_ 's a relatively tough budget but not as tough as advertised.
