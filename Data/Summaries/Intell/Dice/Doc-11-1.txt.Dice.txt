SAN FRANCISCO 1996-08-20 Levi Strauss & Co. said Tuesday it was launching a line of slacks meant to appeal to men who do_ n't like suits , in only the third major brand introduction in the company's 140-year history. The new slacks , to be called Slates , will be marketed as dressier than the company's famous jeans or its Dockers pants brand , but not as formal as suits. Those men want something different to wear as the workplace gets more casual , _ a new look for business and social occasions that falls between casual cotton pants and suits , _ Westfall said. Cogan said research revealed that men hate to shop for dress pants and believe _ it_ 's more enjoyable to go to the dentist _ because they ca_ n't find what they need or like. In a national telephone survey of men in their 30s and 40s , almost half of men who do not work in jeans or a uniform said their office dress code is somewhere between suits and cotton pants , according_to Levi Strauss.
