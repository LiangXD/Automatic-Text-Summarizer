INTERVIEW $- Spyglass device profit seen later. 1997-03-31 Spyglass Inc said Monday its move to link devices other than personal computers to the Internet is continuing on target , but its return to profitability will likely come later than originally expected. _ We felt '97 and '98 would be years that we would actually invest in the business , and then we believe thereafter we will return to profitability , _ Spyglass chief executive Doug Colbeth said in an interview. Spyglass said last December it expected to post a loss in the first two quarters of its fiscal 1997 , which began October 1 , 1996 , before returning to profitability in the second half. Comments: would usually omit the company said , but i think it is important to know that the company is claiming this, and not anyone else. _ There is no doubt we have our focus 100 percent on the device market today , _ Colbeth said. The company reported a profit of $0.27 a share for fiscal 1996 ended September 30. _ It really feels like things are progressing along like what we said in October , and we do_ n't see any tremendous variance off that , but remember , this is a very new market , _ Colbeth said at the Spyglass headquarters in Naperville , outside of Chicago. Spyglass said its professional services division , which makes the software work on a customer's particular device , is expected to account for 30 percent of its business.
