Looking tired but blithesome after more than a month of daily election campaigns throughout the southern African country, Mugabe cast his vote in a weekend presidential poll, in which he is facing a serious challenge from his main rival Tsvangirai. He told journalists after casting his ballot that he was more than confident of winning the election. Tension has risen sharply in Zimbabwe in recent months, after long and sometimes violent election campaigns. While defying international pressure to back down from his controversial land reforms, Mugabe has said he needs a new six- year mandate to complete the reforms. The controversial land reform is the pillar of Mugabe's electoral strategy, which political analysts say could work either way. In Mugabe's view, the March election is a new chapter in his long struggle against colonial rule, which he led from the early 1960s until the country's independence.
