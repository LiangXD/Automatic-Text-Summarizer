US Treasuries end mixed as stocks slide sharply. Three-month bill rates fell four basis points to 5.19 percent. Six-month bill rates fell five basis points to 5.31 percent. The government said U.S. personal income rose 0.9 percent in February while U.S. personal spending rose just 0.3 percent. But both bill and short-coupon yields edged a_bit lower while the back end languished. _ Patrick Dimick , trader and Treasury strategist at UBS Securities Inc. , said the front end of the Treasury curve _ is going to continue to draw some support from flight to quality buying if this stock market carnage continues to grow. The stock market's Dow blue chip index has fallen about seven percent from its all-time high of 7112.10 achieved earlier this year. Dimick said that since the Fed raised rates on March 25 , Treasury bills and short coupons _ have dramatically outperformed intermediate and longer-dated paper , in large part because_of the equity market dynamics. _ A stock market-driven flight-to-quality bid at the front end of the Treasury _ will complicate life greatly _ for people who have placed trades based on the expectation that the yield curve will flatten , Dimick said. Year bill rates slipped two basis points to 5.67 percent on Monday.
