Islamic countries are with the US in combatting terrorism but we don't want it to be prolonged because it can create trouble and instability all around the Islamic world, he said. Syed Hamid said the international community must deal with terrorism rationally and form a new security architecture to combat what he described as a new dimension of crime against humanity in the long term. This is not the conventional security but it is internal and we must look at terrorism and its sources, he said. Syed Hamid said critics must also accept that the war against terrorism could affect civil liberties. The declaration was necessary because terrorism was the most dangerous enemy of law-abiding citizens and an affront against law and democracy , Syed Hamid said. Mahathir has urged the United Nations to convene an international meeting on terrorism.
