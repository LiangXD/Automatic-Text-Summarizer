Seven months after having rejected the Kyoto Protocol because he considered it to be without scientific basis, detrimental to US economic interests, and unfair in not obliging medium-sized nations (like Brazil and India) to reduce their gas emissions in the same proportion as that imposed on industrialized countries, Bush made public the plan that, he promised, would not have any of the defects of the Kyoto Protocol and would achieve the same, if not better, results. Basically, the Bush plan makes the reduction in pollution gas emissions conditional on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate. The first problem pointed out by critics is that Bush has created a new concept, that of greenhouse gas intensity, which could be defined as the volume of gas emissions divided by GDP. Some environmental entities calculate that Bush's plan will lead to the US's emitting! , in 2010, 29 percent more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990. More important are two indisputable conclusions, both potentially embarrassing to the Bush administration and extremely threatening to the world as a whole. The long- standing ties Bush and several of his leading advisors have with these companies allow us to suppose an ultimate conflict of interests that would only increase with the government's persistent alignment with their goals.
