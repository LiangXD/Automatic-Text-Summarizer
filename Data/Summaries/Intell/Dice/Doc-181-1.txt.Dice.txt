The computers are biological molecules, using DNA for software and enzymes for hardware, and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second. Some scientists believe DNA-based computers could have an advantage over existing computers based on silicon chips. Although computers with DNA input and output have been made before, they have always involved a laborious series of reactions, each requiring human supervision. For now biological computers only know how to answer simple questions with a yes or no response. Professor Shapiro and a growing number of other scientists believe DNA-based computers may lead to a number of useful applications -- they could be planted inside cells, where they would watch for irregularities or even synthesize drugs. The computer simulates the cell's natural mechanisms with an accuracy level of 99.8 percent. Let's say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a B DNA type appears in a DNA section is odd or even. The DNA section -- the input -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer's hardware. Once the computer has dissected the entire input, it can determine whether the sequence appeared an even or odd number of times according to the last label -- the output. The computer can also do other calculations, such as checking whether the B sequence appears at least once, or at most once, by inserting different types of software DNAs.
