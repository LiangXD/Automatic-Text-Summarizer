Club Fed And Our Invisible Troops DefenseWatch (sftt.org) January 30, 2002 Club Fed And Our Invisible Troops By David H. Hackworth The brouhaha created by breast-beating human-rights groups over our military's treatment of the terrorist scuzz now vacationing at the Pentagon's recently opened Cuban Club Fed - eagerly aided and abetted by a press too prone to the sensational - is something else. These bleeding hearts claim we're brutalizing the captives by forcing them to wear orange jumpsuits, sleep on mats, exercise daily, shower frequently and eat special food. This time around, they've already bitten one of the soldiers guarding them and threatened to kill anybody else who gets too close. However you want to categorize these creeps - who are living a lot better at Club Fed than they ever did in the caves of Tora Bora - Geneva Convention rules are for uniformed soldiers, not for skyjackers who fly commercial planes filled with moms and dads into office buildings manned by civilians operating computers, or for zealots who kill Arab women because they drive a car or don't cover their faces. Had anyone checked, they would have discovered that our U.S. Army Military Police guarding the terrorists think the prisoners are being treated a lot better than they are. They're not pleased that the brass, the lawmakers and the press are more interested in the well-being of the detainees than the soldiers guarding them, and that they might as well be invisible. They get four hot meals a day, fresh fruit, regular issues of snacks such as sunflower seeds, regular clean clothes laundered by the Marine supply system, says another soldier. The Marine general here says we can have a beer when off duty, but our Army leadership is running so scared that it set a no-drinking policy, says another troop. The Red Cross put us in a very dangerous situation with their demands, and sadly our leadership went along with it, a soldier said. The Marines are right, the Army's wrong, and we're stuck in the middle. Maybe someday, do-gooders, editors, lawmakers and senior Army leaders will remember our soldiers are human beings with human rights, too, and get their side of the story.
