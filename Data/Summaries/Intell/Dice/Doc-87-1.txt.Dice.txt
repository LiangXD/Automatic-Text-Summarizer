CHICAGO 1997-03-31 Implied volatilities for dollar-pair options crept higher on Monday despite the dollar's retreat into familiar territory , puzzling traders and suggesting to some that a more decisive move lies ahead. One-month dollar/yen and dollar/mark volatilities rose even as spot dollar backed further away from upper-end boundaries at 125 yen and 1.70 marks , analysts noted. _ Everyone has been wondering what is behind this movement _ in volatility , said an options trader for a Japanese bank. The trader said the market appeared to be growing more convinced that a sharp move in the dollar is imminent. _ Everyone agrees on one thing $-- it_ 's a matter of time $-- but views are mixed when it comes to a direction , _ he said. One-month dollar/yen volatility climbed to 10.30/10.55 percent , a gain of about 0.7 point from Thursday's close. Analysts said the downturn in U.S. stocks was not yet affecting dollar volatility. _ The wild card is the stock market , _ said Alan Revercomb , options strategist for I.D.E.A. Inc. The mixed views in the market were reflected in a shift in risk reversals in favor of yen calls , traders said.
