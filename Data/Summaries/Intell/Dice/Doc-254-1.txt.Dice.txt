In the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says. Interviews with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months. If the heavy outflows continue, fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead. The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $32 billion. Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds, too. The $1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $150 million in the past two months. About 98% of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds, says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going into money market funds. He adds: Our fund has had {positive} net sales every month for the last three years -- until this month. The fund now holds a cash position of about 15%. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors yanked out about $182 million in the past two months. Fidelity's junk fund has fallen 2.08% this year through Oct. 19, Lipper says; the Vanguard fund rose 1.84%; and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66%. People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again, some analysts and fund specialists say.
