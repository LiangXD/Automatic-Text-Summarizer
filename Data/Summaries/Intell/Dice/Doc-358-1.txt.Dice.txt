Ministry Criticizes 'Odious' U.S. Report The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it was surprised, to put it mildly by the U.S. State Department's criticism of Russia's human rights record and objected in particular to the odious section on Chechnya. The State Department's annual human rights report, which was published Monday, said Russia had a poor record regarding the independence and freedom of the media and in Chechnya. The Foreign Ministry said that the State Department pronouncement on Chechnya reflected the efforts of certain circles in the United States that object to the new U.S.-Russian partnership against international terrorism. The ministry also suggested that before judging others' rights records, the United States should investigate the situation at home, including the government's failure to ratify some international human rights agreements and the use of the death penalty.
