1997-03-31 Great Western Financial Corp said Monday hostile suitor H.F. Ahmanson and Co's effort to solicit shareholder consents to start negotiations has fallen _ far short _ of a majority of the outstanding shares. Earlier Monday , Ahmanson said more than 80 percent of _ voted _ Great Western shares supported its proposals. Great Western has agreed to be acquired by Seattle-based Washington Mutual Inc and has rejected Ahmanson's initial offer and a subsequent revision that increased the amount of stock that would be offered to Great Western shareholders. The Ahmanson proposals are designed to pressure the Great Western board to run an open auction process. The spokesman said Ahmanson stands behind its numbers that more than 80 percent of voted shares back its solicitation and that 19 of Great Western's 20 largest shareholders have voted for or indicated a vote for Ahmanson's proposals. Based on stock prices late Monday , the Ahmanson proposal was worth $43.65 per Great Western share and the Washington Mutual proposal was worth $43.48. Great Western shares were trading at $40.375 per share , down $2.25.
