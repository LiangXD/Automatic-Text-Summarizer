Seeking an ethical watchdog for the genetic scientists By TOM WILKIE IN A RARE display of consensus last week , industry , consumers _' organisations and the environmental movement called for a national committee to examine the social and ethical implications of biotechnology and genetic engineering of plants and animals , Tom Wilkie writes. Ann Foster , the council '_ s food policy adviser , said : & bquo ; There should be the equivalent of a Warnock Committee to look at aspects of genetic manipulation other than simply matters of safety. & equo ; The Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology was set up in July 1982 under the chairmanship of Dame Mary Warnock to investigate in_vitro fertilisation and human genetic research. The NCC meeting provided an unprecedented forum for all sides ? representatives of consumer interests , environmental groups such as the Green Alliance , and commercial firms such as ICI ? to come together to discuss the implications of the new biotechnology. Keith Pike , a manager of ICI Seeds , told the meeting that & bquo ; industry likes to know where it stands. But he opposed any suggestion that representatives of the environmental movement might sit on the technical committees set up_to decide on the safety of any release of genetically manipulated organisms into the environment. Its scientists have snipped through the genes of tomato plants to produce a version that will ripen and develop full flavour without going soft and spoiling in transit between the grower and supermarket shelves.
