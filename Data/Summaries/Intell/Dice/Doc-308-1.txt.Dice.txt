The shuttle will bring back to the Earth its crew, which has spent 7 days on-board the International Space Station (ISS,) and the 3rd long-term expedition to the ISS, namely, American astronaut Frank Culbertson and two Russian cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin. The primary objective of the shuttle's mission to the ISS was to deliver the 4th ISS crew and research equipment. According to the Mission Control, the shuttle's crew has perfectly accomplished its mission. On its way home, the shuttle launched into space the Starshine micro-satellite, which had been designed by students. According to the Mission Control, the satellite which is no larger than a volley ball, has been made by thousands of students who were polishing small pieces of glass subsequently putting them on its surface.
