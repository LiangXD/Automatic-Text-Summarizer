WASHINGTON 1997-03-31 Selling off federal hydropower plants and power marketing agencies would be very complex and would likely affect electricity prices in some areas , according_to a Congressional report released Monday. However , the report did not weigh the costs and benefits of a sale , a hot issue for lawmakers looking to balance the budget and for companies pushing for open power markets. The report did not specify what the effect would be on rates , saying : _ The potential effects of a divestiture on wholesale and retail electric rates , which in turn would affect regional economies , are other important issues. _ Citing advocates for selling the power marketing agencies , the GAO said the private sector would be able to operate and maintain the assets more efficiently than the government.
