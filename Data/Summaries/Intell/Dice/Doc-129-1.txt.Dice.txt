However, these two rockets are primarily used to launch low orbit satellites. In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket. In order to compete with the United States, Europe, and China, Japan decided to drastically reduce its costs, especially in every aspect of rocket design and manufacture. This low cost approach brought about a series of satellite launch failures. In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies. Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development. In the field of satellite communications, Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) spent $310 million to develop the ETS-8 (Engineering Test Satellite 8) satellite. This satellite doubled the capacity of the test satellite previously launched by Japan. A Japanese made H2A rocket will launch this satellite in 2002. Military surveillance satellites are also included in its development plan. Japan has prepared a military space program and allocated $1.3 billion to implement it. Japan also has a huge space power plant plan. In addition, it also plans to develop 12 satellites, a new generation of unmanned space lab, a space station supply system, and a space shuttle in the next 5 years. Lunar A, one of the major projects, is aimed at delivering two penetrators on the moon to collect various data. Japan is determined to become a major power in aerospace. Between 1970 and the end of 1999, Japan launched a total of 66 satellites. Japan also has a relatively strong aerospace industry. By 2010, Japan will increase its global market share in aerospace to 17.4 percent.
