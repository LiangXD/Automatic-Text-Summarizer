MDC leader Tsvangirai at it again in South Africa Herald Reporter OPPOSITION youths are agitating to get guns to shoot President Mugabe out of office, MDC leader, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai said in South Africa yesterday. Speaking in an address to the Cape Town Press club, Mr Tsvangirai, who is on a visit to South Africa, was quoted by Reuters as saying he was having to rein in militants keen to fight President Mugabe's rule. Mr Tsvangirai endorsed a United States proposal for targeted sanctions against President Mugabe and members of his Government but said full economic sanctions would be a ruinous mistake. If sanctions are imposed on Zimbabwe, it will not survive. Until such time as Mugabe actually subverts the electoral process - when one goes to that extreme, international sanctions will be an option. Mr Tsvangirai might face charges of contravening the Law and Order Maintenance Act for allegedly threatening to violently remove President Mugabe from power last year. The superior court has since heard State and defence arguments on the legality of the charges being laid against the opposition leader and reserved judgment. If the Supreme Court rules in favour of Mr Tsvangirai, who if convicted on the charges might face life imprisonment, the Attorney General's Office will have to draw up a new charge.
