Between June 21 and August 31, 45 youth will spend 20 hours a week developing life management and work ethic skills, learning the computer, visiting area colleges, and interacting with guest speakers. We would like to offer our youth a small reward for their participation by presenting them with gift certificates from Target. In return, we will recognize Target as a sponsor during our event and in the event program. Target is well known for it's support of the community, and we believe that the Summer Enrichment Program represents your interests and concerns quite well.
