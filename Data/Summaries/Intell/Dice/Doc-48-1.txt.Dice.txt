JAPAN : Japan carmakers weather palladium market turmoil. Japan carmakers weather palladium market turmoil. Keiko Takagi TOKYO 1997-03-31 Japan's carmakers are weathering turmoil in the palladium market , including a halt in Russian shipments to Japan and volatile prices , without major changes in their purchasing practices , industry sources say. Palladium and other platinum group metals are used to make key components for catalytic converters , used in car and truck engines to clean exhaust emissions. _ There has been no major shift in our purchasing patterns so_far , _ said a purchasing manager at Toyota Tsusho Corp , trading arm of the Toyota Motor Corp group. _ Palladium prices are still relatively low and we are not overly concerned about the Russian situation , as we expect Russia to resume platinum group metal exports before long , _ he added. Japanese trade houses have scrambled in recent months to cover the palladium lost from Russian contracts by buying in the spot market. This buying helped push palladium prices above $160 an ounce in mid-March for the first time in 1-1/2 years , compared with $120 to $125 in January. She added that recent supply disruptions and price rises were unlikely in the near term to encourage carmakers to cut use of palladium in favour of other platinum group metals.
