Bulgaria to float state firms on revived bourse. Thalia Griffiths SOFIA 1997-03-31 Bulgaria's industry ministry , facing a mammoth task in restructuring 1,150 state firms , hopes to float some companies on a revived stock exchange to make privatisation more transparent and attract foreign investors. Link: [Comments: s1 provides the referent for He.] _ Domestic buyers in the market are not that many and our hope was that if we float say 10 to 20 percent of a certain number of big state companies on the stock exchange we will find institutional investors from the West , _ Marinov said. He told Reuters in an interview the cash generated by such investment would go back into the companies instead_of into the state budget as with direct privatisations. _ At the moment Bulgaria is ideal for foreign investors in some ways because here you can buy low and sell high because_of the general depression we are in at the moment , _ Marinov said. Marinov said floating the companies would make the privatisation process more transparent as potential investors would have open access to financial data. _ It_ 's a half-way house to attracting foreign investment but also it_ 's an end in itself to create a stock-owner society. _ Bulgaria's mass privatisation programme has issued eight billion levs of stock but at present there is no clear procedure for trading it. Marinov said this was still under negotiation with the World Bank as a condition for the FESAL loan but he expected a proportion of about 30 percent. If it is successful then Bulgaria will open up_to the West much faster than through other means , _ Marinov said.
