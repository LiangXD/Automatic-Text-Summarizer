Kawamura: Japan and Taiwan are both exporting nations. The traffic on Taiwan's seas is extremely important to Japan. If Taiwan becomes a part of China, all of Taiwan's sea areas will be threatened. Under these circumstances, Taiwan and Japan both must recognize clearly the important role of the navy. Question: What is your appraisal of Taiwan's navy? Kawamura: Frankly speaking, Taiwan's navy is worrisome. Taiwan should make an all out effort to augment naval combat strength. I reckon that at the last stage, the United States will provide the Aegis destroyer to Taiwan. The most likely method is to use missiles to threaten Taiwan psychologically. Question: How should Taiwan respond to China's missile threat? Sato: I gave a speech on this issue in Taiwan. Taiwan has some people who very obviously purposely play up China's use of force to scare Taiwan. Before the United States attacked Afghanistan, it first explained the reasons to every nation of the world, and China using missiles to attack Taiwan is certainly not simple. If China only uses common warheads, at most, it would only make a few holes in Taiwan. Question: What is the significance for Taiwan of the United States and Japan jointly researching TMD theater missile defense system technology? Taiwan is also very important to the United States, especially Taiwan's strategic position. Currently, Taiwan's Patriot missiles are effective against guided missiles. I reckon that the probability of war occurring between China and Taiwan is smaller than small.
