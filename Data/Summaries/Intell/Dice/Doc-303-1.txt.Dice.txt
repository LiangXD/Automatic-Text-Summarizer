America is axis of evil for the Arab world The American president is not really popular in the Arab world. George Bush has become an object for harsh criticism after his recent statement about the axis of evil. The editor wrote that Bush showed in his speech that he is craving for blood and is ready to declare war on half of the world in order to take revenge. The editor believes that Bush is willing to wage war against Iran and Iraq, because they have weapons of mass destruction, but Bush does not want to notice that Israel also has these kinds of weapons. Atvan said that Bush's speech looked like one of Hitler's. The editor of the Arabic newspaper believes that one should do everything possible to put an end to Bush's imprudence, otherwise the war that he is going to have will overshadow the World Wars.
