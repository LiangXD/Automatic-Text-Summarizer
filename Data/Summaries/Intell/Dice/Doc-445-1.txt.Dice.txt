A time for a youngster to enjoy the fun and benefits of residential camp living, dedicated staff and instruction, and a chance to make special friends. That's why I want you to learn more about the Super Summer Safari Camp. It costs $225 to send one child to camp. Please make camp possible for all deserving Indianapolis children and send in a tax deductible contribution today in the enclosed envelope. Sponsor a child at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis' summer camp today!
