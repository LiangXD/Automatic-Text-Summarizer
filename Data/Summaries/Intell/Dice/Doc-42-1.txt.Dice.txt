BOJ seen allowing money rate fluctuation $- analysts. Risa Maeda TOKYO 1997-03-31 The Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) may continue to let Japanese short-term money rates to fluctuate widely after April 1 to remind the market of the risk of relying too much on overnight money , analysts said on Monday. The BOJ also needs to encourage the financial institutions to reduce their reliance on overnight money prior_to its introduction of the _ real-time gross settlement _ ( RTGS ) system , they said. The rate was at 0.53 percent on the previous day. _ By allowing the key overnight rate to rise sharply , the BOJ at that time let market participants know that they should take a liquidity risk as long as they rely on the overnight money , _ said Shoji Kitta , president of Totan Research Co. _ Also , if the BOJ leaves the current upward bias in the key overnight rate after April , which is highly likely , that may encourage banks to use longer-term transactions and lessen settlement risks in trading overnight money , _ he said. But the key overnight rate was boosted to 0.85 percent by some banks which were in great need of overnight money after failing to raise enough longer-term funds covering the fiscal year-end , bankers said. The BOJ has said the financial firms' efforts to reduce reliance on overnight call money and do more longer-term transactions is necessary for an introduction of the RTGS.
