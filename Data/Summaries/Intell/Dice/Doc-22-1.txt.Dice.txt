SOCCER-BOTAFOGO BEAT THE RULES TO REACH FINAL. Brian Homewood RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-03-30 Botafogo won the first stage of the Rio de Janeiro championship on Sunday after a match in which the bizarre rules of the competition , rather_than rivals Vasco da Gama , appeared to be their real opponents. Botafogo won all eleven of their games in the first stage of the tournament but were then forced to decide the title in a Sunday's one-off match against Vasco , who finished the stage eight points below them in second place. The rules stated that in the first stage , the top two teams would meet in a final , no_matter_how far apart they were. Curiously , the next two stages will be decided on points , with no final being played. Botafogo still have to play in the next two stages but can win the title automatically if they win them both. The top two teams in each group qualify for the final stage.
