Sun, a maker of computer workstations, reported sales of $538.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. In a statement, Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive officer, said the company's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April. One of those new computers, called Sparcstation 1, accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter, he said. These problems also resulted in Sun reporting a $20.3 million loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30.
