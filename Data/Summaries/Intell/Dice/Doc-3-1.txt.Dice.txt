USA : Kansas , Arizona add to suits against tobacco firms. Kansas , Arizona add to suits against tobacco firms. 1996-08-20 Kansas and Arizona filed lawsuits against some of the biggest tobacco firms Tuesday , joining a growing list of states seeking to recover hundreds of millions of dollars for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall called tobacco _ the most lethal consumer product ever sold _ and said her state's lawsuit was warranted because_of the _ enormous financial burden _ that the tobacco industry had shifted to Kansas taxpayers. Inc. , one of nine tobacco companies named in the suit , said it would vigorously defend itself against the suit , which it said had no basis in law. A jury was expected to begin deliberations Wednesday or Thursday in the case of Richard Rogers , an Indianapolis lawyer who began smoking at age 6 and died of lung cancer 46 years later. Stovall said the Kansas lawsuit suit was the broadest to date because it sought to force tobacco firms to pay for programs aimed at educating children about the hazards of smoking.
