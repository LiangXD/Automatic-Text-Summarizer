Russia disagrees with 'axis' remark MUNICH, Germany -- Russia's defense minister said Sunday that his country disagrees with the U.S. view of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil." President Bush described Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil" during his State of the Union address on Jan. 26. On Sunday, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accused Iran of giving refuge to al Qaeda or Taliban members escaping from Afghanistan. "The Iranians have not done what the Pakistan government has done, put troops along the border to prevent terrorists from escaping out of Afghanistan into their country," Rumsfeld said on ABC's This Week. China's official Xinhua news agency also weighed in Sunday on Bush's choice of words, accusing the president of orchestrating public opinion in advance of possible strikes against the three countries in an expansion of the war against terrorism. And he unfurled his own list of "rogue states" that either support terror or build arsenals of deadly weapons. "Well, we don't like some of your allies like Saudi Arabia or Gulf states who give finance to terrorism organizations," Ivanov said.
