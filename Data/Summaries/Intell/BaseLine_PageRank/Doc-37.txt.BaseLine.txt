Tim Radford reports on the prospects and options for farmers in the next year $... He could grow & bquo ; biomass & equo ; for biotechnology. He could diversify into new crops like meadowfoam , lupins , borage , linseed and flax. If the climate changes a_bit more , he could grow sweet corn in the south and wheat in the north. He could also go broke ? last year , farm incomes fell by 25 per_cent. His land could tumble down to scrub and nettles and eventually untidy woodland. Britain is over-producing : there will have to be some way of reducing output. There is a Ministry proposal called & bquo ; extensification. & equo ; It means that the whole farm has to produce 20 per_cent less. There are various calculations about how much land is potentially redundant : it could be as many as three million acres. Conservationists , farmers and government agencies all agree that there is an opportunity right_now for debate and then decision. Miss Melinda Appleby is environmental policy adviser to the National Farmers _' Union. As profitablilty declines , they would go out_of farming. The National Farmers _' Union does n't like the idea of set aside. In the first place , the scheme only operates for five years , with no guarantee of continuation. Under this , farms would have to reduce output by 20 per_cent. Some farmers are likely to achieve this by converting to organic farming. Another problem is that the wildlife lobby is divided even over simple things like the future of old farm woodlands. Most of these were & bquo ; coppiced & equo ; ? cut to the ground every 20 years_or_so and then allowed to regenerate. The Agriculture and Food Research Council reckon cereal yields could be increased by another 25 per_cent this century , freeing even more land. They also agree that a debate does n't seem to be taking place.
