The Nikkei index of 225 leading shares bounced back from a late sell-off to close at 18,003.40 points. Many banks had based their financial projections on a close of 18,000 to 18,500 , industry analysts say , meaning they will not have to take further unplanned write-offs on their stock holdings. The close on Monday was hardly great news for Japan , representing a fall of 16 percent from the beginning of the fiscal year. While Japan's top 20 banks must take appraisal losses worth about 1.7 trillion yen ( $13.7 billion ) on shareholdings in 1996/97 , it is unlikely that many will fall into the red , industry analysts said. Posting losses cuts a bank's capital cushion and reduces capital adequacy ratios set by the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) , further undermining the already-tainted credibility of Japanese banks. Analysts said the top 20 banks would stick to their plans to dispose of about 5.0 trillion yen ( $40.3 billion ) worth of problem loans for 1996/97 despite the appraisal losses. Thanks_to declines in market interest rates , operating profits at big banks are estimated to be about 10 percent larger than the 4.0 trillion yen ( $32.3 billion ) the banks had forecast for 1996/97. According_to the Finance Ministry , Japan's deposit-taking financial institutions had 29 trillion yen ( $233 billion ) worth of problem loans at the end of last September.
