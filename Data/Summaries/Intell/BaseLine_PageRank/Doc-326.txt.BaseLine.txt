Canada to hand any war captives to U.S. SubHead: Backbenchers protest: Eggleton tells MPs to remember the real issue: Sept. Mr. Eggleton warned the Liberal MPs they should not forget the horror of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks when considering the plight of Taliban or al-Qaeda prisoners. Next month, a battle group of 750 Canadian troops will join U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Their mission includes hunting down any remaining Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters. We do not have detention facilities and our intent would be to turn them over, Mr. Eggleton said. I have no reason to believe that they have not been treated fairly, but it is up to the International Red Cross to determine that. Mr. Godfrey said, When I see those hooded prisoners being put on planes to Cuba, I say to myself, 'Would we allow that, if Canadian troops were taken?' Human rights groups have criticized the U.S. military's treatment of prisoners captured during its current cleanup operation in southern Afghanistan. About 40 members of Canada's special forces unit, known as Joint Task Force 2 -- are already operating with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. JTF-2 members have not yet taken any prisoners in Afghanistan but they have been on missions in which prisoners were taken, Mr. Eggleton said. One possible policy, he said, would be for Canadian troops operating with members of the U.S. 101st Airborne Regiment to simply defer to the Americans when prisoners are being taken.
