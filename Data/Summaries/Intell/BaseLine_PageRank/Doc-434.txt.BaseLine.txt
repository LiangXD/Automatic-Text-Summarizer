August 10, 1999 Mr. Caring Philanthropy 01234 Giving Way Contribution, USA 56789 Dear Mr. Philanthropy, The urgency you feel to make changes is just the extent that change will be made. Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full of hope and with a positive outlook. Thanks to our Big Sisters volunteers, these young people are self-confident, believe in themselves and are beginning to realize their full potential. Since then, she and I have grown very close and I have been able to experience lots of new things. We go to movies, dinner, concerts, and other stuff like that, but I have also been able to participate in charity events and fundraiser type things. Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister, but I learned a lot from her too. I have become more open-minded, more responsible, and, most importantly, I have gained a lot more self-confidence. In 1998, Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many programs. You are an important part in making sure these young people are matched with caring adult mentors. Sincerely, Andrew T. Burns Patron Relations Chairperson P.S.
