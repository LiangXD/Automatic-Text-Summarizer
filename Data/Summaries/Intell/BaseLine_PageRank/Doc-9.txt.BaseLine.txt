Lim Yun-suk SEOUL 1996-08-20 South Korea's militant students find themselves isolated from a hostile public as they press a violent campaign for reunification with North Korea. Authorities say their leaders are Communist stooges blocking their efforts to bring peace to the divided Korean peninsula. Tuesday's assault by riot police on Yonsei University to flush out several thousand undergraduates who had occupied two buildings was the worst campus violence since President Kim Young-sam took power in 1993. Critics partly blame Kim for the unrest , saying it is the outcome of confusion caused by what they see as his lack of a coherent policy on the North. Yet there is little sympathy for the methods adopted by the young protesters , even_though anti-government protests that pit rock-throwing students against riot police have long been a fixture of campus life. _ Things have changed. It is not fit for the 90s , _ said Kim Sung-joo , a professor of political science at Sungkyunkwan University. College campuses were the breeding grounds for fearless student pro-democracy fighters willing to sacrifice their lives for the cause. As the government is confused about its North Korea policy , how can we blame the students ? _ he said.
