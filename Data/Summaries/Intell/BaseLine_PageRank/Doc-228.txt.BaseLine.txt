At a Japan-US summit meeting on 18 February, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi expressed some understanding of US President George W. Bush's remarks that Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK (North Korea) are an axis of evil. This left the impression that Japan stands alone on this issue because European countries have been cool to Bush's axis of evil rhetoric. At a meeting of several officials held at the outset of the summit, the President first took up economic issues and then referred to his axis of evil remark. He urged Japan to follow the US by saying: The international community needs to cooperate to change Iran, Iraq, and North Korea's action pattern (of spreading weapons of mass destruction). The US has repeatedly suggested the possibility of its taking military action against the government of Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. Although the Japanese Government has expressed understanding of Bush's axis of evil remark, it does not hope to see the US taking military action.
