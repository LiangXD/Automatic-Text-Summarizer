He told journalists after casting his ballot that he was more than confident of winning the election. I will accept the results more than anything because I will have won, said Mugabe. The MDC party has accused Mugabe of using violence and other electoral manipulation to rig the poll. While defying international pressure to back down from his controversial land reforms, Mugabe has said he needs a new six- year mandate to complete the reforms. Under these reforms, the Zimbabwean government has taken over excess and idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of the country's arable land, to resettle landless peasants. However, the program has drawn sharp international rebuke, particularly from former colonial power Britain, but Mugabe has vowed to press ahead with the reforms.
