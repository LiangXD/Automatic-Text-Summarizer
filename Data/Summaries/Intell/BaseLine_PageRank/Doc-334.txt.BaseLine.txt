In the past four months, the shekel has lost 20 percent of its value against the dollar. The Argentine peso lost 47 percent when it was cut loose from its dollar peg in February. Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde tried to instill such confidence among Argentina's citizens after the devaluation of the peso when he said, Those who bet on the dollar will lose. Unlike him, MK Joseph Paritzky did his best to undermine confidence in the Israeli shekel when he told Israelis to consider transferring their wealth abroad. Had Paritzky's misguided advice been taken by most of Israel's citizens, we would be digging ourselves out of the ruins at this time. With good economic management, Israel should have little trouble overcoming the present crisis. Judging by the steps taken by the Finance Ministry, one can only speak of mismanagement. While it was already clear that the economy was well on its way to a recession, the ministry's bureaucrats forecast continued growth for the economy. Based on false premises regarding anticipated government revenues and underestimates of the need for defense expenditures, a totally unrealistic budget was prepared. It was only when the government's income from taxes started to fall far short of the forecast that the bureaucrats woke up. No sooner had it been approved by the Knesset, than talk began of the need for a major revision. Then the finance minister dramatically announced an emergency economic plan based on large-scale tax increases in an already over-taxed economy.
