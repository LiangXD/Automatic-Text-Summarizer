U.S. wants Kyoto dropped from U.N. meet agenda Tadayoshi Sakaguchi Yomiuri Shimbun Correspondent The United States, having pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, is now objecting to its implementation in 2002 being mentioned as one of the goals for a global environmental agenda being drawn up at the United Nations. The United States has pulled out of the protocol, which obliges developed countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and announced in February a voluntary U.S. plan to slow the growth of global warming gasses. The latest move, a sign that the United States is stiffening in its attitude toward the pact, will likely draw the ire of other countries, including those in the European Union as well as Japan, which want an early implentation of the Kyoto protocol. It also stated developed countries would give financial and technical support to those countries vulnerable to climate change, such as island nations, and alleviate the global warming's impact by introducing devices such as satellite observation systems to monitor rising sea levels. Furthermore, concerning assistance to island countries, although the U.S. delegation agreed to establish satellite observation systems, it demanded that wording about the impact of global warming be deleted.
