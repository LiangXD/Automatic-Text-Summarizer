Washington, 17 Apr (Xinhua) -- A farce of coup d'etat was staged in Venezuela recently. According to US news media, that coup in Venezuela had something to do with the United States. By the same token, the coup in Venezuela has incurred widespread condemnation and objection from the international community, including the Latin American states, except the United States. The US Government's first reaction gave much food for thought when it said Venezuela's constitutional president Chavez had himself to blame for the coup. As the saying goes, when you pull up the turnip, mud comes with it. In recent months, they met with the coup organizers for several times and gave consent to the overthrow of Chavez. They acknowledged their contacts with leaders of the coalition of opposition factions who took part in the coup, but denied having supported them. The Pentagon spokesperson Clarke went a step further to explain that US Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary [Rogelio Pardo-] Maurer for Western Hemisphere Affairs met with Venezuelan Armed Forces Supreme Commander and Inspector General Lucas Rincon in December of last year and made it clear to the latter that the United ! After taking the Office of Presidency, Chavez has implemented an independent foreign policy and seemed to be not in step with the United States in many respects.
