It is 5.17am and Lieut Abuhena Mohammad Saiful-Islam of the US navy is performing his first duty as Camp X-Ray's chaplin and imam. God is great, God is great, the officer chants in Arabic through a loudspeaker. The detainees recite the Koran together, the first of the day's five prayer sessions. By mid-morning, they are lounging on mats on the concrete floors of their 8ft-square cages, the blistering sun beating on the tin roofs. A Humvee moves slowly around the perimeter as US Marines, M16 assault rifles at the ready, stand guard. From seven wooden watchtowers, guards train their weapons on the captured Taliban and al-Qa'eda fighters, who are clad in orange jump suits. One man is moved back to his cage, his ankles and wrists in shackles. On entering Camp X-Ray, one inmate vowed to kill an American before he left. Such incidents have been rare, however, and most of the camp's 158 Muslim fanatics are compliant, the guards say. They're just chilling out, that's exactly what they're doing, said Staff Sgt Chuck Albrecht. Like most Marines and MPs making up the 1,200-strong force, Staff Sgt Albrecht is angry at accusations that the detainees have been mistreated. Under the tin roofs, there is wood to absorb the sun's heat and keep them cool. The detainees' toothbrushes are shortened so that they cannot be used as weapons. Sometimes you're afraid for your life because these people are trained to kill you, said Specialist Fabian Rivas. They're willing to give their life to take yours. If I let it get to me I would have a very hard time doing my job. They don't live it, they don't see it, so how can they talk about it? At the camp, Marine engineers saw and hammer away as an interrogation centre and new cages are finished.
