Brussels -- This week, the Second Chamber will initiate the debate on euthanasia. It will discuss the bills on euthanasia and palliative care that the Senate approved in the autumn of 2001. Ever since then, the Senate's work has been subject to increasing criticisms, including from groups that support a possible law on euthanasia. The Chamber's health, environment, and social emancipation committee will only have an advisory role. It includes a few VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] deputies who are very critical of the senators' work.
