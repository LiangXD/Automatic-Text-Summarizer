US President Bush has ordered the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to assassinate America's opponents wherever in the world they may be! This directive is issued at a time when the American government is claiming to lead the fight against terrorism throughout the world. By clarifying the Imam's edict the Islamic Republic of Iran made the people of the world understand that insulting the Prophet was in fact violating the rights of millions of people throughout the world. This was not simply a directive from God that was confirmed by all the clerics throughout the Islamic world. It would therefore be appropriate for all Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the United States.
