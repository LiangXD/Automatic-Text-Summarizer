Recent weeks have seen important developments on both sides of the Atlantic for the policy pursued in combating climate change. It should be remembered that after Bush described the Kyoto Protocol as fundamentally flawed international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed. The United States, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (25 percent of global emissions) withdrew from an international agreement that, for the first time, set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection. We now know that the US withdrawal did not stop the world community from deepening this important multilateral agreement for combating climate change. However, all the parties repeated with insistence that world climate protection cannot be effective unless the United States takes measures that are comparable to these taken by Europe and Japan. This can hardly be described as ambitious as a 15 percent increase in energy efficiency was in any event expected given present productivity levels. With an annual economic growth objective of 3 percent, absolute US emissions in 2012 will be 24.5 percent more than 1990 levels, despite the improvement in energy efficiency. In its last report, the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] called for rapid and decisive action to at least avert the most serious consequences of climate change. Scientists estimate that the industrialized countries must reduce their emissions to around 70 percent by 2020 to maintain climate change at an acceptable level. Researchers have shown that without a determined policy on climate coordinated at international level the consequences of climate change will be dramatic. Anybody who fails to exploit these markets from the outset will remain lagging behind. The three liters for 100 kilometers car, high efficiency turbines, and solar panels are export successes and their development is driven by a climate protection policy of growing amplitude.
