Dear Bill: This is the time of year when our thoughts turn to ways to do things differently, things that will make our lives better and improve the quality of our life. MCCOY Inc., originally founded as a government agency but re-organized in 1993 as an independent not-for-profit, is a county-wide youth services coordinating, planning, and convening agency. In addition to that behind-the-scenes role, MCCOY has taken an out-front role in developing a Summer Bus Pass, neighborhood youth councils, and the We Value Youth information line. I have enclosed a packet of information about MCCOY and its work as well as an application with various options for supporting the youth of our community.
