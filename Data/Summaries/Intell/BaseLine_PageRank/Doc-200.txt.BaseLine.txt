Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Liberal Party) has voiced his approval of the U.S. treatment of the 144 al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo military base on Cuba. EU foreign affairs spokesman Javier Solana, among others, has also criticized the United States for not recognizing the al-Qaida prisoners as prisoners of war as understood in the Geneva Convention. Fogh: They Must Be Given a Fair Trial The prisoners must be treated with respect for their integrity and religion, and they must be given a fair trial, Fogh Rasmussen says. On Monday Liberal Party foreign affairs spokesman Troels Lund Poulsen said that the debate on prisoners' rights is an intellectual discussion. Per Stig Moller: Give Them Rights Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller (Conservative People's Party) is urging the United States to guarantee the prisoners the status of prisoners of war and in consequence protection under the terms of the Geneva Convention. Social Democratic Party: Raise Denmark's Voice The Social Democratic Party takes the view that the Danish Government should raise its voice against the United States. Even though we support their action, we should criticize this form of treatment of prisoners, Socialist People's Party Chairman Holger K. Nielsen said. To begin with, I have great confidence that what the Americans are doing in relation to these prisoners is reasonable.
