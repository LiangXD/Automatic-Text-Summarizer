August 4, 1999 Name Address City, ST Zip The goal of MCCOY, Inc. has been to make a difference. In 1998, MCCOY, Inc. led two efforts that, we believe, will help our community continue to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop well. Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified three goals for all our youth to obtain: economic self-sufficiency, healthy family, social relationships, and involvement in the community. Two, funding was made available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct positive youth programming on Saturday evenings. Through the youth mapping process, it was confirmed that the positive opportunities for youth on weekend evenings were lacking.
