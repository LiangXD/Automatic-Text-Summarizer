Africa's two richest and most powerful nations, South Africa and Nigeria, decided to punish Zimbabwe on Tuesday for a flawed presidential vote. Their courageous stand will help renew a promise by leading industrialized nations to provide more aid, trade, and investment only if Africa shows better governance and democracy. Their endorsement of yet another type of diplomatic isolation of Zimbabwe shows solidarity with the West. The grand pact, known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, was initiated by the two leaders. Without the rule of law and fair elections in Africa, no amount of aid can help it. Many of the continent's other governments found little fault with the way Mugabe ran the election, despite overwhelming evidence of voter intimidation and manipulation of polls.
