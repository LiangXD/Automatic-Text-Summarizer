About 4,000 Castro supporters -- workers, students, housewives and retirees -- gathered on the streetcorner where the Cuban leader declared the country socialist in a speech on the eve of the April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion by an American-trained exile army. "This commemoration acquires special relevance this year," said Jorge Arias, a top local Communist Party official. He said it was a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came so soon after Venezuelans "have written a page of dignity and honor by going out into the streets to overthrow the coup attempt."
