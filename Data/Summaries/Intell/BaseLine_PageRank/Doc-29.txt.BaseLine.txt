Seeking an ethical watchdog for the genetic scientists By TOM WILKIE IN A RARE display of consensus last week , industry , consumers _' organisations and the environmental movement called for a national committee to examine the social and ethical implications of biotechnology and genetic engineering of plants and animals , Tom Wilkie writes. The proposal came at a meeting organised by the National Consumer '_ s Council , a representative body established by statute in 1975. She stressed that such an investigation would not hinder progress or hold up commerical companies , but would further public acceptance of the technology and so foster developments. The only persistent jarring note came from civil servants responsible for framing safety regulations and administering the various safety committees. Keith Pike , a manager of ICI Seeds , told the meeting that & bquo ; industry likes to know where it stands. Its scientists have snipped through the genes of tomato plants to produce a version that will ripen and develop full flavour without going soft and spoiling in transit between the grower and supermarket shelves.
