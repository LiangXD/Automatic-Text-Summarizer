Politics, not the environment, drives Kyoto Author: Barry Cooper and David Bercuson The only winners in the increasingly heated debate over global warming are the boffins in Ottawa. A few days later in Munich, provincial opposition was hedged with qualifications: The NDP premiers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba apparently thought the principles of Kyoto were fine. Herb Dhaliwal, the federal Energy Minister, weighed in with even more qualifications: Some important details have to be worked out before Canada ratifies the Kyoto Protocol, he said. I wouldn't sign a contract in business unless I knew exactly what it meant. Another sign the debate is intensifying emerged last week at a global warming conference in Ottawa. Lorne Taylor, the Alberta Environment Minister, estimated the costs of Kyoto to the Canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year. Taylor told his Quebec critics that they should be more circumspect. They stand with empty pockets and their hands empty, out toward Alberta, and at the same time they're criticizing Alberta. At the same conference, Taylor's federal counterpart, David Anderson, announced that the Alberta numbers were absurd. No one knows the impact on Canada's international competitiveness, when China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia are not committed to reduce anything. Finally, vast uncertainty is built into computer models of climate change. The best models today dice the atmosphere into a collection of virtual cubes about 185 miles on a side. Because of the three-dimensional nature of the problem, doubling the resolution requires 16 times the computer power.
