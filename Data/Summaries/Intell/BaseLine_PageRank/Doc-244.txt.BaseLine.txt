By contrast, Electronic Data Systems Corp., GM's data processing subsidiary, boosted net 16%. Earnings for GM common stock, reflecting the performance of GM's core automotive operations, will be disclosed this morning. GM Class H, which represents a dividend interest in Hughes earnings, closed at $29, up 25 cents in Big Board composite trading. GM Class E, which represents a dividend interest in EDS profit, fell 75 cents to $52.25 on the Big Board. In addition, GM's North American vehicle production fell 8.4% from a year ago, which hurt Delco Electronic's earnings, a company spokesman said. That decline was reflected in revenue for the GM Hughes unit, which edged down to $2.58 billion from $2.63 billion. At EDS, third-quarter profit jumped 16% to a record $110.9 million, or 93 cents a share, from $95.9 million, or 79 cents a share. Revenue from non-GM accounts was 45% of EDS's total business in the latest nine months, compared with 40% a year earlier.
