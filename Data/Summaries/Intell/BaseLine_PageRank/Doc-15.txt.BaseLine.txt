Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 Lower imports shrank the U.S. trade deficit dramatically in June , the Commerce Department said Tuesday , bolstering the impression of gradual waning in the economy's vigour. New bilateral irritants emerged , though , as the trade shortfall with China swelled 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion to become the biggest with any country. It surpassed for the first time the $3.24 billion deficit with Japan , which was up 3.6 percent from May. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor told a news conference that the Clinton administration was _ extremely resolute _ about trying to break down Chinese barriers to U.S.-made goods. That partly offset a $138 million decline to $12.32 billion in foreign sales of industrial supplies and materials. Lower imports of new cars and parts , especially from Japan and Germany , as_well_as cheaper petroleum helped shrink the merchandise trade gap. Analysts said beforehand that an influx of tourists bound for the Olympic Games in Atlanta would boost the services surplus. Computer imports were down $413 million to $4.24 billion and semiconductor imports decreased $291 million to $2.87 billion in June.
