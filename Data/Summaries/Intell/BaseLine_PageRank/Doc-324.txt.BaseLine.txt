There is nothing to be gained by frightening people when all the facts are not known. But the $40-billion figure, far from being conceived to frighten Canadians, is plucked straight from government documents. As for the globally felt benefits that would follow from Canada's implementation of the Kyoto protocol, they are slight. Even if Canada managed to convince the United States and every other Kyoto signatory to ratify the protocol, world carbon dioxide emissions would still soar. Under the fully implemented treaty, carbon dioxide emissions would grow 26% during the 1990-2010 period. The worldwide cost of that 8% dip: about $2-trillion in lost GDP -- give or take a trillion. If scientists are correct, higher temperatures and rising sea levels will depress grain yields in Africa and parts of Asia, fuel the spread of diseases, and threaten coastal nations such as Bangladesh and Senegal. While helping Third World nations plant new crops, vaccinate people and relocate coastal towns will be costly, the bottom line will likely be only a fraction of Kyoto's 13-digit price tag.
