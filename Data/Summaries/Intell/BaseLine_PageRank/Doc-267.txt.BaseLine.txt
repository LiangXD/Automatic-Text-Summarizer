At the same time, the sheer size of the loss, coupled with a slowing of orders, made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense-electronics concern. Just clobbered, said Ulric Weil, an analyst at Weil & Associates who had once been high on the company. Unisys, whose revenue inched up 3.7% in the quarter to $2.35 billion from $2.27 billion in the year-earlier quarter, had an operating loss of about $30 million. On top of that, the Blue Bell, Pa., concern took a $230 million charge related to the layoffs of 8,000 employees. In addition, Unisys set up an unspecified reserve -- apparently $60 million to $70 million -- to cover the minimum amount it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the defense-procurement scandal. The company also reported slower growth in another important business: systems that use the Unix operating system. That means Unisys must pay about $100 million in interest every quarter, on top of $27 million in dividends on preferred stock. He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year. He said the move toward standard operating systems means customers aren't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down. The information-systems industry is still going to be a high-growth business, and we're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company. Some had predicted earnings of more than $4 a share for this year, up from last year's fully diluted $3.27 a share on earnings of $680.6 million. So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $2 a share from $3.
