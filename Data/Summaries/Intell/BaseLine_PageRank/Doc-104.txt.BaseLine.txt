About half of American drivers between 21 and 24 say they've thumbed messages or emailed from the driver's seat. And what's more, many drivers don't think it's dangerous when they do it -- only when others do. And those activities spiked 50 percent over the previous year, even as states rush to ban the practices. And nearly two of 10 acknowledged sending texts or emails from behind the wheel. That spiked up to half of drivers 21 to 24 years old. But 90 percent said that when they are passengers they feel very unsafe if the driver is texting or emailing. Indeed, big majorities of drivers surveyed support bans on hand-held cellphone use and texting while driving -- 71 percent and 94 percent, respectively. And most said they want people who violate the bans to be punished with fines of $100 or more. There were very few situations in which drivers said they would never talk on the phone or send texts. The survey results help us understand why some people continue to make bad decisions about driving distracted, NHTSA Administrator David Strickland said. It is clear that educational messages alone aren't going to change their behavior, Adkins said. Rather, good laws with strong enforcement are what is needed. Before and after each enforcement wave, NHTSA researchers observed cellphone use by drivers and conducted surveys at drivers' license offices in the two cities. So far, there is no evidence that crashes are reduced when cellphone and texting restrictions are implemented, Rader said. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., would cut back highway funds to states that fail to enact a ban.
