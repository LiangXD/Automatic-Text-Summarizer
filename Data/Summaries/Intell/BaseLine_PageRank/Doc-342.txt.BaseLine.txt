But with voting going very slowly at some stations, Tsvangirai accused authorities of holding things up to hurt his chances in the two days of voting. Tsvangirai (pronounced CHAN-ger-ai), a union leader, is promising reforms in this southern African nation, which is mired in its worst economic crisis since independence. Human rights groups and many political analysts say that the campaign was too tainted for elections to be free and fair. The opposition says scores of its polling agents have been detained or harassed The government refused to accredit most independent Zimbabwean voting monitors, but many of them showed up outside of polling stations anyway. In the rural town of Chininga, 12 farmers were arrested after helping election monitors reach polling stations, the Commercial Farmers Union said Saturday. The few pre-election polls reveal voters' fears - with one reporting that 70 percent of people questioned refused to say who they would vote for. That's my secret, I can't tell you, Ronnie Dube, a 48 year-old carpenter, said when asked how he would vote. Mugabe, 78, has promised public works initiatives if he is re-elected and has pledged to continue his controversial program of seizing white-owned farms and giving them to landless blacks. Whites make up less than one percent of the country's population but own about a third of the nation's commercial farmland. I know you are tired; I know you are scared and I know you are hungry. Some 150 people have died in politically motivated violence over the last two years, many of them black opposition activists believed to have been killed by ruling party militants. Two weeks ago, Tsvangirai was charged with treason in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate Mugabe. Voting went smoothly in the village of Nkayi, one of the communities hardest hit by pre-election violence, about 90 miles north of Bulawayo.
