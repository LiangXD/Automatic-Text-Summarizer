The computers are biological molecules, using DNA for software and enzymes for hardware, and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second. Such tiny devices could one day fit into cells and supervise biological processes, or even synthesize drugs. DNA strands exist in almost every body cell -- they are biological software that tell each cell and molecule what to do. Some scientists believe DNA-based computers could have an advantage over existing computers based on silicon chips. Artificial chips have reached their limits and can't get any smaller. Although computers with DNA input and output have been made before, they have always involved a laborious series of reactions, each requiring human supervision. For now biological computers only know how to answer simple questions with a yes or no response. They work better than anything I've seen so far, said Eric Baum, a computer scientist at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton, New Jersey. Although he questions whether biomolecular computers will ever become really useful, he believes they are a step in the right direction. Natural DNA processes also involve inaccuracies which are corrected by other genes, says Shapiro, and it is almost impossible to reach absolute accuracy using biological systems.
