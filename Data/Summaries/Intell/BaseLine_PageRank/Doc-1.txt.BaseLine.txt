June exports eased a slight 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion while imports dropped 3.3 percent to $77.82 billion. Amid the big overall improvement in June trade , China emerged for the first time as the nation with which the United States has the largest bilateral shortfall. The deficit with China climbed 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion in June , surpassing the $3.24 billion deficit with Japan that was up 3.6 percent from May. Steady improvement in shrinking the deficit with Japan was the main reason that China became the leading deficit nation in June , Commerce officials said. Previously , the department said the overall May trade deficit was $10.88 billion but it revised that down to a $10.55 billion gap. Lower imports of new cars and parts , especially from Japan and Germany , helped shrink the merchandise trade gap. Analysts said beforehand that an influx of tourists bound for the Olympic Games in Atlanta would boost the services surplus. Computer imports were down $413 million to $4.24 billion and semiconductor imports decreased $291 million to $2.87 billion in June.
