Billions of investors' dollars are pouring out of the nation's junk-bond mutual funds, undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market. It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds. Interviews with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months. Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices.

Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds, already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems. But tremors are likely in the junk-bond market, which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years.

He adds: Our fund has had {positive} net sales every month for the last three years -- until this month. Vanguard's $1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen $161 million flow out since early September; $14 million of that seeped out Friday Oct. Still, two-thirds of the outflow has been steered into other Vanguard portfolios, says Brian Mattes, a vice president. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors yanked out about $182 million in the past two months. Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers.
