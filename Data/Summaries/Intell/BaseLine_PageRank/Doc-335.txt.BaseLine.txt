The space shot might be rescheduled for this evening, but a decision won't be made until this morning, a NASA official said Thursday. The shuttle will take seven astronauts to the International Space Station, where three of them will begin a six-month stay aboard the orbiting science lab. On Wednesday, an unmanned Russian supply rocket filled with food, clothes, toilet supplies and other items arrived at the station but had trouble docking. But NASA officials want further study because they are concerned it might damage the locking mechanism for the supply ship.
