We just want someone who can give us food, hospitals, school fees. A better life, says Martha, explaining why she voted for MDC candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. There are many Marthas here, people who marched to ZANU-PF anthems and cheered President Robert Mugabe at rallies, while secretly planning to vote for Mr. Tsvangirai. They wear the T-shirts and go to the rallies, but inside, they don't believe, she says. I wanted to go home, but I have to vote, she says. In Kuwadzana, there were seven polling stations for about 55,000 people. Rural Bindura had 41 polling stations for a smaller number of people. An increasing number of local election monitors and international observers say the vote rigging has been so thorough that hopes for a free election are dead. Murchabaiw, diagnosed in the last stages of AIDS, does not believe he will live to see the results of this election. In urban areas, lines snaked for more than a mile and angry voters sometimes tried to push their way into polling booths. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at one restless crowd, injuring at least 12 people. Some polls stayed open all night, with people voting by flickering candlelight or under harsh fluorescent bulbs. Old and illiterate voters were assisted by ZANU-PF officials who often directed them to vote for the incumbent president. Despite everything, there is still hope in Zimbabwe that this election may bring change. I am happy because I finally got to vote, says a jubilant Colin Chipepera, after waiting for more than 12 hours in one Harare voting line. Even with all their tricks, there are too many of us.
