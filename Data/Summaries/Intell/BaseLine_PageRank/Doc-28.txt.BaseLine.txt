Eugene Moosa TOKYO 1997-03-31 Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto , moving to tackle his biggest political problem , vowed on Monday to push through legislation to extend land leases for U.S. military bases beyond a May deadline. It was the first time Hashimoto had formally confirmed he would submit a bill to parliament revising the land expropriation laws , an issue which has become the most pressing domestic headache for his government. The new legislation will , in effect , give the Japanese government a temporary extension of its leases on land occupied by the U.S. bases after the current contracts expire. Hashimoto faces a May 14 deadline on the leases on land owned by some 3,000 people on Japan's southern Okinawa island , who are refusing to renew the contracts. At stake are a series of mainly small plots of land totalling 36 hectares ( 89 acres ) on 12 bases including the U.S. Air Force's huge Kadena Air Base. Hashimoto also said he would not ask U.S. President Bill Clinton to withdraw U.S. troops from Japan because_of uncertainties in the region's security.
