President Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and, at about 10:10, Air Force One changed course and began heading due west. The immediate objective was to find a safe location-not too far away-where the President could land and speak to the American people. The President's military aide, an Air Force officer, quickly researched the options and, sometime around 10:20, identified Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim destination. When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about 11:45, personnel from the local Secret Service office were still en route to the airfield. Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the President's remarks, while the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security situation with superiors in Washington. The President completed his statement, which for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live, and the traveling party returned to Air Force One. The next destination was discussed: once again the Secret Service recommended against returning to Washington, and the Vice President agreed. Air Force One arrived at Offutt at 2:50 P.M. At about 3:15, President Bush met with his principal advisers through a secure video teleconference. That evening the Deputies Committee returned to the pending presidential directive they had labored over during the summer. The secretary of defense directed the nation's armed forces to Defense Condition 3, an increased state of military readiness. He quoted Psalm 23- though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks, joined the discussion. IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME As the urgent domestic issues accumulated, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten chaired a temporary domestic consequences group. One question was what kind of public health advice to give about the air quality in Lower Manhattan in the vicinity of the fallen buildings. They evaluated legislative options, eventually setting up a federal compensation fund and defining the powers of a special master to run it. Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal operations. The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems of protection and preparedness. Though a number of agencies had some part of the task, none had security as its primary mission. President Bush announced the new post and its first occupant- Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge-in his address to a joint session of Congress on September 20. Some (such as Zacarias Moussaoui) were actually in INS custody before 9/11; most were arrested after. The clearance process approved by the Justice Department was time-consuming, lasting an average of about 80 days. Records indicate that 531 were deported, 162 were released on bond, 24 received some kind of immigration benefits, 12 had their proceedings terminated, and 8-one of whom was Moussaoui-were remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. The inspector general of the Justice Department found significant problems in the way the 9/11 detainees were treated. Guidelines on this subject issued in August 2001 by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson essentially recapitulated prior guidance. The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 26. First, we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals, domestic or international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of September 13, 2001. To the contrary, every flight we have identified occurred after national airspace reopened. Third, we believe that the FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals who left the United States on charter flights. They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion. Our own independent review of the Saudi nationals involved confirms that no one with known links to terrorism departed on these flights. PLANNING FOR WAR By late in the evening of September 11, the President had addressed the nation on the terrible events of the day. When the larger meeting that included his domestic department heads broke up, President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top advisers, a group he would later call his war council. The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of the attacks, but also those who harbored them. The President tasked principals to go beyond their pre-9/11 work and develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them. The principals agreed that the overall message should be that anyone supporting al Qaeda would risk harm. The United States would need to integrate diplomacy, financial measures, intelligence, and military actions into an overarching strategy. The principals also focused on Pakistan and what it could do to turn the Taliban against al Qaeda. That afternoon, Secretary of State Powell announced at the beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had agreed to every U.S. request for support in the war on terrorism. The next day, the U.S. embassy in Islamabad confirmed that Musharraf and his top military commanders had agreed to all seven demands. Musharraf said the GOP [government of Pakistan] was making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would pay a domestic price. At the September 13 NSC meeting, when Secretary Powell described Pakistan's reply, President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban. He made clear that the military should focus on targets that would influence the Taliban's behavior. Both departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence, basing, and other support from countries, according to their capabilities and resources. The U.S. military, Franks said, did not have an off-the-shelf plan to eliminate the al Qaeda threat in Afghanistan. All these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of September 15-16, as President Bush convened his war council at Camp David. Present were Vice President Cheney, Rice, Hadley, Powell, Armitage, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Mueller, Tenet, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and Cofer Black, chief of the DCI's Counterterrorist Center. He proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would join the fight against al Qaeda. But Shelton added a new element-the possible significant use of ground forces- and that is where President Bush reportedly focused his attention. After hearing from his senior advisers, President Bush discussed with Rice the contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion. In a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting, President Bush charged Ashcroft, Mueller, and Tenet to develop a plan for homeland defense. In addition, Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action in Afghanistan, including the administration's first Memorandum of Notification on Bin Ladin. The President also tasked Rumsfeld to ensure that robust measures to protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented worldwide. NSC staff members had begun leading meetings on terrorist fund-raising by September 18. Also by September 18, Powell had contacted 58 of his foreign counterparts and received offers of general aid, search-and-rescue equipment and personnel, and medical assistance teams. It also incorporated the President's determination not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them. The new directive-formally signed on October 25, after the fighting in Afghanistan had already begun-included new material followed by annexes discussing each targeted terrorist group. The United States would strive to eliminate all terrorist networks, dry up their financial support, and prevent them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. PHASE TWO AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein's regime might have had a hand in it. Speculating about other possible states that could be involved, the President told us he also thought about Iran. Rice's chief staffer on Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked Iraq to al Qaeda. Finally, the memo said, there was no confirmed reporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on unconventional weapons. On the afternoon of 9/11, according to contemporaneous notes, Secretary Rumsfeld instructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible. According to Rice, the issue of what, if anything, to do about Iraq was really engaged at Camp David. She recalled that in the first Camp David session chaired by the President, Rumsfeld asked what the administration should do about Iraq. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for striking Iraq during this round of the war on terrorism. Iraq's long-standing involvement in terrorism was cited, along with its interest in weapons of mass destruction. Secretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitz-not Rumsfeld-argued that Iraq was ultimately the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked. Powell said that Wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that Iraq was behind 9/11. Though continuing to worry about Iraq in the following week, Powell said, President Bush saw Afghanistan as the priority. At the September 17 NSC meeting, there was some further discussion of phase two of the war on terrorism. Within the Pentagon, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case for dealing with Iraq. On September 19, Rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked on their contingency plans. General Tommy Franks, the commanding general of Central Command, recalled receiving Rumsfeld's guidance that each regional commander should assess what these plans meant for his area of responsibility. On September 20, President Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the two leaders discussed the global conflict ahead. Some members of his administration, he commented, had expressed a different view, but he was the one responsible for making the decisions. (CENTCOM also began dusting off plans for a full invasion of Iraq during this period, Franks said.) Having issued directives to guide his administration's preparations for war, on Thursday, September 20, President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session of Congress. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated. President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central Command's General Franks and other advisers on September 21 and October 2. This occurred in the weeks following 9/11, aided by overwhelming international sympathy for the United States. In Phase Two, air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al Qaeda and Taliban targets. In an innovative joint effort, CIA and Special Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan faction opposed to the Taliban. The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially secured-after arduous effort-by the end of that month. On December 22, Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun leader from Kandahar, was installed as the chairman of Afghanistan's interim administration. In December 2001, Afghan forces, with limited U.S. support, engaged al Qaeda elements in a cave complex called Tora Bora. In March 2002, the largest engagement of the war was fought, in the mountainous Shah-i-Kot area south of Gardez, against a large force of al Qaeda jihadists. The three-week battle was substantially successful, and almost all remaining al Qaeda forces took refuge in Pakistan's equally mountainous and lightly governed frontier provinces. In Phase Four, civilian and military operations turned to the indefinite task of what the armed forces call security and stability operations. According to a senior CIA officer who helped devise the overall strategy, the CIA provided intelligence, experience, cash, covert action capabilities, and entr�e to tribal allies. With these initial victories won by the middle of 2002, the global conflict against Islamist terrorism became a different kind of struggle.
