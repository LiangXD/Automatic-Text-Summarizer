1996-08-20 Kansas and Arizona filed lawsuits against some of the biggest tobacco firms Tuesday , joining a growing list of states seeking to recover hundreds of millions of dollars for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. At the same time , sources said that Michigan and Oklahoma were preparing to file similar lawsuits this week , bringing to 14 the total number of states suing the industry. Inc. , one of nine tobacco companies named in the suit , said it would vigorously defend itself against the suit , which it said had no basis in law. Meanwhile , aides to Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley said he would file a suit against tobacco companies on Wednesday while legal sources said Oklahoma would file suit Thursday. Also on Tuesday , New York City's public advocate urged Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to sue the tobacco industry to recover what the city paid out for health care costs of smokers. Public Advocate Mark Green said the city should join the group of states and the city of San Francisco in their efforts to obtain Medicaid refunds from cigarette companies. Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods said his state was seeking more than $300 million in damages related to costs Arizona incurred in Medicaid costs for smokers' illnesses.
