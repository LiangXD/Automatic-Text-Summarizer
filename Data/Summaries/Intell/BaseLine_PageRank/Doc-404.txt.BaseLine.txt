Geneva Convention applies to Taliban, not Al Qaeda: US WASHINGTON, Feb 7: The White House on Thursday declared that the Geneva Convention applies to Taliban forces in the Afghanistan phase of the war on terrorism, but not to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda followers. The move comes after fevered criticism - including from key US allies - stemming from alleged mistreatment of Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees the United States is holding at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It will not change their material life on a day-to-day basis: they will continue to be treated well because that's what the United States does, said Fleischer, who noted neither group would be granted prisoner of war status. DETAINEES ARRIVE IN CUBA: A new group of 28 prisoners captured in Afghanistan arrived by air on Thursday, bringing the total number of detainees to 186. Earlier on Wednesday, the US military resumed controversial flights of heavily guarded Al Qaeda and Taliban captives from Afghanistan to a naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a senior US official said. The shackled and blindfolded captives are being flown to Cuba from Kandahar in southern Afghanistan under tight guard and are being housed at the base in 8-by-8-foot cage-like outdoor cells.
