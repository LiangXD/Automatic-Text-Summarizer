Yeom Yoon-jeong SEOUL 1997-03-31 South Korea's ailing won shot up 2.25 percent against the dollar on Monday after the government announced steps to open stock and bond markets wider to foreigners. The finance ministry earlier said foreign investors would have access to non-guaranteed bonds issued by large companies for the first time. The government would also allow domestic financial institutions to raise funds in Asia and Europe for investment in the local bond market this year. In the past few weeks , speculators have been betting against the won , calculating the central bank is losing its ability to defend the currency due_to dwindling foreign exchange reserves. A falling won has not helped exports as expected because the yen has dropped even more steeply against the dollar. And there is also alarm that the overall weak economy is boosting the jobless rate , which now stands at 3.5 percent , its highest level in almost three years. But economists warned the government was too optimistic. _ I doubt if foreign funds will really flow in as much as the government estimates , _ said an economist at the Korea Institute of Finance , who declined to be identified.
