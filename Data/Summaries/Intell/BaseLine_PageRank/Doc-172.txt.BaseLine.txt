Brussels - New confidential documents indicate that current Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the army's former leadership were directly responsible for massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in 1982. Lawyers for the survivors, who have filed a complaint against Sharon in Belgium, said this. The documents include meeting reports, and intelligence service and interrogation reports. Judging from a few texts that De Standaard was given access to, the documents seem to be related to the Israeli Kahan Commission. They gave the entire stack to Investigating Magistrate Patrick Collignon. Senior generals and Sharon bore command responsibility [preceding two words published in English] for the militias' actions. According to Belgian and international criminal law, they could be held responsible, Verhaeghe said.
