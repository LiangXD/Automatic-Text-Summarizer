It is unlikely that further knowledge will improve treatment , but it may allow prevention of the disease , at_least in a proportion of cases. Either no insulin is produced ( Type 1 diabetes ) or the muscle , liver and fat cells fail to respond to insulin ( Type 2 ). With astonishing speed , in the era before regulation of new drugs , Lilly developed systems for extracting pork and beef insulin from slaughterhouse offal. Some of these are unavoidable , others are said to result from the use of animal insulin , which differs slightly in structure from human insulin. In the 1970s , genetic engineering made it possible to clone human insulin genes in micro-organisms which secreted insulin with the same structure as natural human material. Two systems for engineering a & bquo ; human & equo ; insulin were developed and most patients have been switched to these engineered products. The new techniques were used to & bquo ; improve & equo ; existing therapy , while fundamental research into the causes of diabetes has only recently begun to yield important results. Three papers published recently in Science move us a_little closer to understanding the basis of the disease , which turns out to be highly complex. Detailed biochemical work has shown that target cells carry an insulin receptor molecule on their surfaces , which reacts with insulin molecules in the surrounding body fluids. A series of complex activation steps then occurs which changes the state of the target cells. This provides circumstantial evidence that some cases of human Type 2 diabetes result from a similar failure. By contrast , genetically-engineered & bquo ; human & equo ; insulin is flashy stuff , a rapid application of advanced molecular genetics to modify a therapeutic product.
