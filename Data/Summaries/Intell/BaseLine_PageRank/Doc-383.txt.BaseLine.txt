A deep split appeared between Western nations and African countries monitoring the vote, who closed ranks behind Mugabe, calling the election legitimate. Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede declared Mugabe the winner after results were in from all 120 constituencies. He said the former guerilla won his fifth term as leader after taking 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,401 for Tsvangirai. The opposition leader said his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) would not accept the result. Zimbabwe security forces went on high alert and erected roadblocks around Harare after the result was announced. Small groups of armed riot police moved into Harare townships loyal to Tsvangirai. Several hundred Mugabe supporters danced in celebration and carried mock coffins for Tsvangirai in two Harare townships.
