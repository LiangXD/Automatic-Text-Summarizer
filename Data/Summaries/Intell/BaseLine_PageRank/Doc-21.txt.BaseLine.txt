SAO PAULO 1997-03-31 Double world champion Michael Schumacher learned on Sunday that his season was again going to be a struggle $-- thanks_to the Formula One tyre war. The German Ferrari driver struggled to finish fifth behind the victorious Jacques Villeneuve in the Brazilian Grand_Prix , second race of the year. Schumacher had hoped to lead his Italian team on a championship challenge this year and he made it clear he felt his bid had been undermined by his car's Goodyear tyres , while rivals like Frenchman Olivier Panis and reigning champion Damon Hill were making the most of the new Bridgestone rubber. Although Villeneuve dominated the twice-started race in his Goodyear-shod Williams , it was the performances of Panis , in a Bridgestone-tyred Prost , and Hill , in his much improved Arrows using Bridgestone rubber , which were most notable. Team manager John Walton said : _ I think we could have gone the distance with these tyres and scored a good finish if it had not been for other problems. _ Villeneuve's victory , however , proved that the Canadian had the ability to produce strong racing even when things were tough and he was not running on the best tyres.
