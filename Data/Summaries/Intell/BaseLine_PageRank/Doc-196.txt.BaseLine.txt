The cross-party Parliamentary Human Rights Committee said it was lobbying for a meeting with US ambassador to London William Farish over fears that the 110 detainees held at Camp X-Ray, Guantanamo Bay, are being kept in inhumane conditions. The makeshift outdoor facility houses single cells, each with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls. The United States says the detainees are illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, and thus do not have rights under the Geneva Convention of 1949, which sets out the laws of war. She added that there was substantial concern among Labour members and called for a government statement on the situation.
