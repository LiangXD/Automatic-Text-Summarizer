November 27, 1995 Dear Friend: What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run Children's Homes? Little ones, like Baby Jessica, caught in the struggle between adoptive and birth parents. Older kids, like Tracy and Kerry, left homeless after a recent murder-suicide in Indianapolis claimed Mom and Dad. Families are being torn apart, and too often, children are the victims. Some come from families where, through therapy, there is hope for reunification. For others, families are the counselors are housemates at the group homes where they live. The biggest tragedy is that the problems don't go away; they only grow. They welcome the chance to belong, to become self- sufficient, to regain their self-esteem and confidence.
