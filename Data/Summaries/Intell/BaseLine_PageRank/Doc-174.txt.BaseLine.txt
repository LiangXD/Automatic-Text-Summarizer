ISLAMABAD, Nov 24 (AFP) - Japanese Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka held warm talks here on Saturday with a senior UN official on the refugee crisis in Afghanistan and the hazards facing those wanting to return, a Japanese official said. He told a news conference that Filippo Grandi, regional emergency coordinator for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), had thanked Japan for its contribution to international efforts to aid the refugees. He added that Grandi had outlined to Tanka a four-pronged approach to the crisis -- improving conditions in camps, expanding the UNHCR's ability to deal with any further refugees, assisting non-governmental organisations involved in dealing with the crisis, and encouraging refugees to return to their homes. In the meantime, however, the UNHCR, through its Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (OCHA), was trying to provide tents, clothing and heaters to returning refugees as well as to displaced people within the country wanting to return to their towns and villages.
