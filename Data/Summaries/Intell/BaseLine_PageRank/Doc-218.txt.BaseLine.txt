As Israeli tanks push their way into one Palestinian population center after another it has become more and more difficult to guess what political objectives might be driving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. We can understand this as an immediate military objective, but nothing will be achieved by the operation politically. In the past week, the United States has taken a stand in support of the Saudi Arabian peace plan. In the United Nations, it supported [a call for] the removal of Israeli troops from the cities in the occupied areas. The categorical moral condemnation of terrorism is self-evident, but this will not free Israel from the problem it faces. Even if, contrary to all reason, the operation turns out to be successful, the underlying problem would remain the same as before. Israel is responsible for about three million bitter people who lack political rights. This would soon erode both what is left of the army's reputation and its military cutting edge. Since Sharon refuses to offer the Palestinians their own state with acceptable borders and conditions, there are two alternatives left. The Prime Minister should explain once and for all what third objective he might have for his actions.
