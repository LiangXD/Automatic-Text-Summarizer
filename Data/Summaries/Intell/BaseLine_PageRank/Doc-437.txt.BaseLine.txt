In the summer of 1993, the Marion County Commission on Youth began what can best be described as a new era in its history. It retained, however, the same mission with which it had been charged from its inception: to serve as a catalyst for effective, coordinated, and collaborative service delivery to youth in our community. For the past three years, MCCOY has been actively engaged in accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others: youth service providers, youth, funding bodies, and interested citizens to name a few. We have met with a number of successes along the way, most notably the Summer Fun Line, the Metro Summer Bus Pass, and the development of ten neighborhood youth councils. The formation of The Community Academy, a pilot project directed at expelled students from local school systems, has come about as a result of MCCOY's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response to a pressing issue. McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the inclusion of young people in both decision-making and program planning processes. One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
