DURBAN March 19 Sapa SA OBSERVER: ZIM ELECTIONS NOT FREE AND FAIR Another member of the South African Observer Mission to Zimbabwe says the past weekend's presidential election in the southern African country was not free and fair. Methodist Bishop Purity Malinga on Tuesday echoed the sentiments of South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairwoman Brigalia Bam that Zimbabwe election did not conform to international standards. We were also advised to be vigilant in what we say in private and in public, Malinga said. Each member was handed a booklet containing guidelines on Zimbabwean election laws. The booklet was published by the Electoral Institute of South Africa, in Pretoria. She believed that SAOM head, Dr Sam Motsuenyane had probably based his findings on the guidelines. At one station were not allowed in and told that we had nothing to do with the Zimbabwe issue. Many people were also unable to vote because their names were not on the voters' role. The United States, Britain, local Zimbabwean observers, and the Commonwealth observer team also described the poll as not free and fair.
