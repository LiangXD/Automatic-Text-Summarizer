Coast Guard attempts rescue after freak wave smashes race yacht in Pacific ALAMEDA, Calif. ? The Geraldton Western Australia, which is one of 10 68-foot vessels competing in the Clipper 11-12 Round the World Yacht Race, encountered rough weather in the Pacific Ocean, race organizers said. A large wave came over the yacht, swept away its steering mounting and wheel and left several crew members with injuries ranging from broken ribs to back injuries. We were making good speed, sailing with the third reef in the main, surfing at 15 to 20 knots. Then at our watch change, just before the sun came up, a monstrous foaming swell broke over our stern. The water had so much force in it that it pushed Mark into the helm, snapping the pedestal clean off. At this time the extent of the injuries is not fully known but they are considered serious, the Coast Guard statement added.
