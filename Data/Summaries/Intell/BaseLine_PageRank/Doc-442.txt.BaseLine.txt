As you can see from the enclosed map, your Target store is located in the heart of four of our service areas. Between June 21 and August 31, 45 youth will spend 20 hours a week developing life management and work ethic skills, learning the computer, visiting area colleges, and interacting with guest speakers. The end result will be kids who have a better understanding of and vision for their own future, be it college or a career. We would like to offer our youth a small reward for their participation by presenting them with gift certificates from Target.
