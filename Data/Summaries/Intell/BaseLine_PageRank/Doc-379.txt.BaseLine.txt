Most disturbing are pronouncements by senior government officials and military leaders that they would not allow this former British colony to be led by Tsvangirai and his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change. In a television interview broadcast the other day, Didymus Mutasa, a spokesman for Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party, said that he and other veterans of the country's independence war found the prospect of a Tsvangirai government intolerable. People have said being ruled by the MDC is being ruled by Ian Smith, Mutasa said, referring to the prime minister of white-ruled Rhodesia, as the country was known before gaining independence in 1980. At least 34 people have died in political violence this year, almost all of them supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change. State Department officials this week accused Mugabe's government of numerous human rights violations during the election campaign, an allegation vehemently denied by ZANU-PF officials. But if the MDC wins, I believe Mugabe will announce martial law, throw Tsvangirai in jail for plotting to kill him and send the army into the streets. Government officials last month charged Tsvangirai and two other officials of his party with high treason for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe. Political analysts say the charges may have laid the groundwork for Mugabe to jail Tsvangirai as a last-ditch effort to stay in power should he lose the election. Observers say that could produce long voting lines and discourage some Tsvangirai supporters from casting ballots. A residency requirement introduced last month bans registered voters from casting ballots if they cannot provide leases or utility bills in their names. That, according to foreign diplomats and Tsvangirai supporters, could disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of young opposition supporters who live with their parents.
