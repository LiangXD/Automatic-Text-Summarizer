March 17, 2000 Name Address City, ST, Zip Dear Name: When Jerry was released from prison, he knew it would take hard work and determination to straighten out his life. Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up on the street. He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps until he could find a job and a place to live. The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill's Career Academy staff for job search assistance. The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended, and he returned to Career Academy for help once more. With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana, many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment. And, with your assistance, Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job.
