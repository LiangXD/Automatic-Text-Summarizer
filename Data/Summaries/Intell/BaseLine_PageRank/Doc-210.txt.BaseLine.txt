On March 4, the US State Depart-ment released its annual human rights report. Apart from criticizing the axis of evil countries for abusing human rights, it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti-terrorist alliance. Since Israel suffers from terrorist attacks, the report says, it has been forced to take counter-terrorism measures, making its rights abuses understandable. The report is generally quite frank and its wording strong, but it proposes no corrective action. Consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overshadowing concerns about human rights. In exchange for support for its war on terror, the US is tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by other members of the anti-terror coalition. US activities, meanwhile, show no sign of promoting the universal values of democracy, human rights and peace. 11 and the focus of US anger has turned to countries that have been labeled rogue nations and members of an axis of evil. No one who has ever studied realist political science will find this surprising. After all, compromising between the interests of many different countries is much better than succumbing to the interests of a single country.
