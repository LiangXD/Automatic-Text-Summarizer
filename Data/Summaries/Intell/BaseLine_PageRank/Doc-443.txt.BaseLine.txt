An understanding that, above anything else, success requires genuine effort, a willingness to set challenging goals. Jameson points the way for children who need that extra hand and I hope you'll continue your support this year. You're last gift of $50.00 helped make it possible for us to provide guidance, encouragement and fun to nearly 400 Indianapolis area children. And not just during the summer, but throughout the year. What has your support of our campers meant to them and what have they been able to accomplish because you care? YL teens will make J.C. juniors happen again this year for 7 and 8 year old campers. A five day camp, J.C. juniors introduces at-risk children to Jameson two years earlier than we could previously reach them. The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them.
