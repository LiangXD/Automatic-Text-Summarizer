Shellshocked Managers were striking because Mr Chavez had filled the company's board of directors with his supporters. Despite the announcement, traffic was lighter than a normal Friday and many Venezuelans did not turn up for work. On Thursday a peaceful rally of more than 100,000 mainly middle class Venezuelans had ended in bloodshed. As marchers called for Mr Chavez's resignation outside Miraflores, the presidential palace, shots were fired into the crowd. Eyewitness Euridice Ledesma said snipers fired on the marchers from rooftops near the palace. Film footage also caught armed supporters of Mr Chavez firing indiscriminately at the marchers. Later army chief, General Efrain Vasquez said some Bolivarian groups were indeed armed. Moments later he announced that he had taken five national television channels off the air for telling lies about the government. A succession of officers filled the TV screens to say they supported the people and that the killings were not tolerable. As tanks surrounded Miraflores, Mr Chavez was holed up with senior military officers in a bid to save his presidency.
