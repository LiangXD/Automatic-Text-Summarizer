The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants: the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills. The warning by the U.S. attorney's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June. In those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment. According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure. In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized. Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar's attorneys that they believe Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities. In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said, I don't think there's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases. According to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made.
