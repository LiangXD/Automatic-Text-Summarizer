U.S. and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport and energy companies are expected collectively to lose billions of dollars if lawmakers approve President Eduardo Duhalde's controversial economic package. Presidential spokesman Eduardo Amadeo said Duhalde was stunned by the intense efforts to reverse the package. The economic package nonetheless was passed by Argentina's lower house late Saturday night and is expected to gain easy passage through the Senate today. The most frantic lobbying Saturday came from banks, phone companies and petroleum firms from Spain. It attracted much foreign investment in the 1990s because companies were promised that their profits in pesos would always be worth the same in dollars. Many political analysts fear a return to street violence when the devaluation measure passes and companies seek to avoid losses by raising prices for food and medicine. On Saturday, Congress began debating an emergency package that would grant vast special powers over the economy to Duhalde, Argentina's fifth president in less than three weeks. MOST DEBT IN DOLLARS More than 80 percent of personal debt in Argentina is in dollars, and most of that debt is held by the middle class. To help them, Duhalde proposes converting mortgages, car loans and other consumer debt under $100,000 into pesos. For foreign companies, especially those from Spain that have invested heavily throughout Latin America, the issue goes beyond how Argentina resolves its crisis. They fear that if Argentina can break promises made in contracts, other nations may try to do the same in less dire times.
