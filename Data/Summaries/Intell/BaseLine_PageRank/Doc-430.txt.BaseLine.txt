Last week, when the Lewinsky story was only a few hours old, Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America to demonstrate his concern. These are probably the most serious allegations yet leveled against the president. There's no question that, if they're true, they... could lead to impeachment proceedings. Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even disgusting about Stephanopoulos' eager show of independence from the president? Political figures turn on each other from time to time, for good and bad reasons; we're used to it. By lending credence to the Lewinsky charges, and treating Clinton's familiar defenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, Stephanopoulos shows he's not a fool. Simply put, Stephanopoulos did as much as any man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments. The 1993 documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts on tape. (Today, of course, the president's defenders claim that Clinton admitted infidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply didn't care.) I guarantee you that if you do this you'll never work in Democratic politics again.... Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst. Much has been made of the way famous wrongdoers (e.g.: Dick Morris, Marv Albert) rebound too quickly in our celebrity culture.
