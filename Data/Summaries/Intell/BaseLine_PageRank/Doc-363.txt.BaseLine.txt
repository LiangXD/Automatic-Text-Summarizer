Taiwan Caucus a US Provocation: Commentary On April 9, the 23rd anniversary of the United States ' troublemaking Taiwan Relations Act, the US Congress is due to unveil a 70-member Taiwan caucus.

It is claimed that the caucus will serve as an official channel for legislators from both the United States and the island to exchange ideas. This comes at a time when there have been conspicuous signs of ever-increasing US-Taiwan military ties.
