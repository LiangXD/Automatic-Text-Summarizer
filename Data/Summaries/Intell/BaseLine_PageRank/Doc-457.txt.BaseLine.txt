HARARE -- Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from some areas of the drought-ravaged country as punishment for not voting the correct way in March's election. He also spoke about the support his country's opposition movement has received from abroad, and his pending trial on treason charges, both issues with Canadian connections. The first targets are the farmers and their workers, then rural-area sympathizers, he said. Ground corn, known locally as mealie meal, is the staple diet of millions of Zimbabweans who can afford little else. But non-governmental organizations operating in the country also said they have been seeing evidence of discriminatory food distribution. After a few days, he decides if they can be allowed to buy grain from the GMB. Meanwhile, Mr. Tsvangirai alleged, the land-reform plan, nominally launched to resettle one million poor families, is actually putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite. He said beneficiaries of the program have included government ministers, MPs, army and police officials -- even Mr. Mugabe's in-laws. The opposition leader commended Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's regime. The international community can support us so far, but it can never remove the shackles of repression, he said. The burden really lies with Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their own freedom. There is no struggle without casualties, but we don't want to engineer any reckless action, he cautioned....
