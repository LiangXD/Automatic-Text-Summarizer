SOUTH KOREA : Little impact seen from Seoul shareholding change. Yoo Choon-sik SEOUL 1997-03-31 South Korea on Monday raised the ceiling for foreign share-ownership by three percentage points , but analysts said they saw little short-term impact on the local stock market because_of poor fundamentals. Ministry officials said the move , along_with other steps to open wider the local capital market , was aimed at attracting foreign funds to put a brake on the local currency's fall. The announcement was made shortly after the close of trade on Monday , but the share market rallied to end 1.52 percent higher on the belief that an announcement was imminent. Analysts welcomed the move , but said immediate beneficiaries would be limited to a handful of blue chips in which foreigners are interested. Analysts said the country's growing current account deficit and the resulting depreciation of the won are the main factors discouraging foreign investment in local stocks. The expansion of the ceiling was in line with South Korea's earlier plan that called for a three-percentage-point increase by the end of this year.
