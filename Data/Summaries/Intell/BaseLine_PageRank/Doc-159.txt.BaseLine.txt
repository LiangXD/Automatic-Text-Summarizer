A container from the Swedish nuclear technology firm Studsvik has leaked radioactive materials. The Swedish and US authorities are looking for people who might have been exposed to dangerous radiation, but there is no indication that the container started to leak in Sweden. According to all indications, the radioactive container sent from the nuclear technology firm Studsvik to the US did not leak during transport within Sweden. When the container was transshipped in Paris, measurements showed no abnormal levels, according to the US Transport Department. The US Transport Department has now informed Studsvik that the measurements done by Federal Express in Paris showed no abnormality. On arrival, measurements showed that it was emitting far too much radiation. The SSI is now attempting to trace people who could have been exposed to the radiation leak. All shipments from Studsvik Isotope Service have been halted until further notice.
