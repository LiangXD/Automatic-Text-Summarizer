Thalia Griffiths SOFIA 1997-03-31 Bulgaria's industry ministry , facing a mammoth task in restructuring 1,150 state firms , hopes to float some companies on a revived stock exchange to make privatisation more transparent and attract foreign investors. Deputy Industry Minister Marin Marinov said on Monday revival of the stock exchange , which suspended floor trading in October , was one condition of a structural adjustment loan under negotiation with the World Bank. Link: [Comments: s1 provides the referent for He.] _ Domestic buyers in the market are not that many and our hope was that if we float say 10 to 20 percent of a certain number of big state companies on the stock exchange we will find institutional investors from the West , _ Marinov said. The sale of a 60 percent stake in soda ash producer Sodi to Belgium's Solvay for $160 million is currently held up by objections from Italy's anti-monopoly commission. Rather_than the lists of companies for liquidation drawn up with the previous government , the interim cabinet agreed with the IMF and World Bank to eliminate a proportion of losses , a more flexible approach if individual cases are held up. General elections are due on April 19 but the industry ministry team expects to stay on under the new government and continue its work. _ This is really a pilot programme. If it is successful then Bulgaria will open up_to the West much faster than through other means , _ Marinov said.
