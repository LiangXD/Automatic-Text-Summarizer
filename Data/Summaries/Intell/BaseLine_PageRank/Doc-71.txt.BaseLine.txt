Stephen Weeks VLORE , Albania 1996-04-01 Shops , bars and cafes have been looted on almost every street. The main bank has been burned , its blown-up safe dumped outside in the central square of this southern Albanian port. When troops hit the picturesque Adriatic coast , they will find a bleak and dreary place , which once had 75,000 residents , in utter disarray.

Mounds of dirt , blocks of concrete and piles of boulders sit in pot-holed roads. Seaside restaurants and bars have been vandalised : windows shattered , furniture stolen and appliances carried off. Berisha's three-storey presidential villa overlooking the sea has been cleaned out and trashed. They dug up 10-metre ( yard ) sections of water and drainage pipe and ripped out electrical cable inside walls. While Laluci talks a rowdy argument among several people can be heard in a classroom. No one here has been paid , no pensions given , no money , nothing , _ said Laluci. Residents blame Berisha for their fate , which forced more than 13,000 Albanians to flee to Italy in unsafe boats in March alone.
