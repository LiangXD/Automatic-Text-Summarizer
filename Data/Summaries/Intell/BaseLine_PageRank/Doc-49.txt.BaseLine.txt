Taiwan economic minister Wang Chih-kang confirmed receiving such assurances from Formosa chairman Wang Yung-ching and said Taiwan had no intention of allow Formosa to finance the plant. _ We can clearly declare that the government will not allow investment in power plants ( in the Chinese mainland ) , _ Wang Chin-kang said on state radio. Central Bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong told lawmakers that an initial central bank inquiry showed Formosa had not illegally sent money to China from Taiwan , state media reported. The announcements from Formosa and the economic ministry capped a day of uncertainty and intense anxiety over the fate of the giant investment , with Taiwan stocks tumbling 1.42 percent $-- largely on the strength of a plastics sector selloff. In June 1996 , Formosa said it and local Fujian authorities would jointly build a 3,600-megawatt plant , easily the biggest Taiwan investment in China and the first in the power sector , which Taipei had made off limits for Taiwan investors. Formosa sought Taiwan approval but backed out two months later after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui urged local firms to slow their investments in the arch rival Chinese mainland.
