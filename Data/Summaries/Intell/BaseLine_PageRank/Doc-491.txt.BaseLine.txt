Settlers Have Taken Palestine Hostage A few days ago the parties in the Palestine conflict found themselves at a crossroads. The escalation of the conflict has now cost over 1,000 people their lives in the space of the past 18 months. Circumstances have led to a situation where today the two parties in the conflict find themselves on the road that leads swiftly to the abyss. It was then that the Arab heads of state adopted the three noes: no to negotiations with Israel, no to recognition, no to peace. The resolution that was put forward by Saudi Arabia was a plea addressed to the Israeli people over the heads of Ariel Sharon's government. No Arab leader was in any doubt that from Sharon's standpoint the resolution was not welcome. His name figured on a list that Israel had shortly before handed over to the Palestinian security service. Despite Arafat's promise to take action to neutralize the people on the list, he did not lift a finger. They decided to take steps to destroy the Palestinian terrorist structure, arrest its leaders, confiscate arms, and so on. According to these sources, Sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while Arafat hesitated. It cannot solve the Israeli people's security problems, because the root of the terrorism is the Israeli occupation and the Israeli settlements on occupied territory. The settlers, who number around 220,000 people, have taken the Israeli Government and consequently both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples hostage. He demonstrated this he as defense minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which led to Arafat's being forced into exile in Tunis. Military superiority cannot solve problems that are fundamentally of a political nature. The day the Israeli tanks again leave Ramallah they will have sown the seed for new terrorist actions.
