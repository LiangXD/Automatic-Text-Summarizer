Certainly not, was the comment made in a private dialogue with La Nacion by a diplomatic source from the United States who, with a legion of colleagues, is attending the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development that opened yesterday in Monterrey, Mexico. And, while striding hastily through the large facilities of the International Business Center (Cintermex), he sketched an explanation: Argentina is the leading case of an era in which everyone pays dearly for his mistakes, and somehow manages as best he can. If someone earns 1,000 and spends 1,500, he will inevitably succumb to bankruptcy. As soon as he arrives on Wednesday, Duhalde will meet with Fox, perhaps spearheading the explanation of the Argentine situation to Bush: a possibility that is not entirely clear among the Mexican officials, especially since, in principle, the virtual plan will have to take place step by step. First I listen, and then I will see, commented one of them to La Nacion. More Political Than Economic It is common knowledge, among most of the small groups, that the Argentine crisis is more political than economic, and that, as one Latin American diplomat accredited to the UN remarked, the formula in question does not hold much mystery: A rapprochement with the United States is indispensable, because it is the only one that can extricate them from this. These are geostrategic plans at moments when time is exerting pressure, and also pressing the speed at which the world turns. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan himself said, in his time, that the situation of indebted, undeveloped countries must be consideed, so as to avoid the repetition of a crisis such as ours. In the documents, Argentina ranks in 59th place for its per capita income: $7,440, according to the World Bank's report on development: a substantially devalued figure after the default and the end of the currency board arrangement.
