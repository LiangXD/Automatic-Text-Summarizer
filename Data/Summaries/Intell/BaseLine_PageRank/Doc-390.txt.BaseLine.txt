U.S. Tells China Taiwan Remarks a Mistake - Xinhua BEIJING -- The United States told China U.S. President George W. Bush had made a mistake when he called Taiwan a country in a speech last week, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday. Washington told China the U.S. government has not changed its Taiwan policy and said it would not refer to Taiwan in that way again, Xinhua quoted a foreign ministry spokeswoman as saying. Beijing, which regards the island as a wayward province to be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary, asked for an explanation on Saturday of why Bush had referred to Taiwan as a country.
