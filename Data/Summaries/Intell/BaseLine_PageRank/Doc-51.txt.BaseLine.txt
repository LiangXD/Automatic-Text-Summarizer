The cause of death was still unknown, but there were no signs of trauma, incident commander Tom Bemis said. It's too early to say, there was nothing obvious, he told the Boulder Daily Camera. Lodge co-owner Dean Bruemmer, who helped with the search Saturday, said he last saw his friend at breakfast. Though daytime temperatures in southwest New Mexico have been mild of late, temperatures have dipped into the mid-20s on recent nights. Fourteen search teams that were scouring the area Friday were supplemented with additional volunteer teams from across the state Saturday morning, McDonald said. They also used dogs and employed a helicopter and plane in the search. True, who had been friends with Bruemmer and his wife, Jane, for 10 years, would often visit their lodge while traveling between Mexico and his Boulder, Colo., home. As a result, Bruemmer said, True certainly knew the trail system well -- which made his disappearance all the more mystifying to everyone. Michael Sandrock, a columnist who writes about running for The Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, knew True for at least 20 years and had run with him.
