Timothy Heritage MOSCOW 1997-03-31 President Boris Yeltsin gave the green light on Monday to a draft treaty that would push Russia into a union with Belarus , despite liberals' fears that he might be signing away some of his powers to a hardliner.

Ryurikov said the agreement could still be amended before Wednesday , leaving doubts about just how close ties between the two Slav states and former Soviet republics will be. The union would develop a joint legal system , joint running of energy , transport and communications systems , promote mutual trade and adhere to a common customs policy. One Kremlin security aide , Boris Berezovsky , said the failure to consult Russia's neighbours over the union was also _ absolutely inadmissible _. He played down suggestions that the supra-national council would have sweeping powers , but the wording remained vague. Lukashenko , a 42-year-old former collective farm boss , said last week the Kremlin had rejected the notion of forming a single state.
