Leaders of the United States probably withheld their breath Monday evening while watching on television what Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to say to his people. It amounted to much more than what one could have expected. The military great power that towers over Afghanistan has committed itself to overthrow the ruling Taliban system, and has pledged to support the US anti-terrorism military operation now being prepared. One cannot underestimate the significance of the fact that Russia has opened its airspace. True, Putin only permitted (Americans) to deliver via Russian airspace aid to the theater of the anti-terrorism military operations, (i.e. not soldiers and weapons). Nevertheless, this amounts to such high degree of Russian-American cooperation in a wartime situation, the two sides have never attained during the past 10 years. And Putin has established the prospect of taking further steps in this regard. Accordingly, Russia has joined the anti-terrorist coalition of the United States virtually without reservation. But making this complex decision was not easy for him. Reformers told Putin all along that he should take advantage of the rare opportunity for (Russia) to become integrated with the civilized world. In reality, Putin asked for a free hand regarding Chechnia, some understanding, or even that the Americans look the other way. If we view this warning against the background that Putin's government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin's hands behind Chechen terrorism, we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow's views.
