San Salvador, 17 April (ACAN-EFE) -- Salvadorian President, Francisco Flores, today defended his declaration of support for the interim Venezuelan Government headed by industrialist Pedro Carmona, indicating that the information that he had at the time was that Hugo Chavez had resigned the Presidency. Our position is very clear, our position was that the new authorities had to receive a vote of confidence to lead the Venezuelan process back to the democratic path, he stated. He added we understood that if there were a civilian who had committed himself to call for elections he should receive a vote of confidence. He explained that El Salvador took a different position from that of other Latin American countries because at the present time it presides over the Permanent Council of the OAS. Asked what repercussions an announced visit to Venezuela-by leaders of the opposition party Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN, left wing)-would have for his government, Flores said that my concern is that they may be seeking to cause damage to the country.
