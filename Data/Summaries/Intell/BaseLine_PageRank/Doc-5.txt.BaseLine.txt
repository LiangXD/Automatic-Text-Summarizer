Helen Smith LONDON 1996-08-20 In a theatre open to London's often rainy skies , a troupe of actors begins a risky experiment on Wednesday to discover what William Shakespeare's plays were like when first peformed 400 years ago. It is the realisation of the dream of American actor-director Sam Wanamaker , who died of cancer in 1993 , just as the theatre's wooden framework was being put in place. Wanamaker had waged a 40-year battle against bureacracy and commercial greed to get the new Globe built just yards ( metres ) from the site of the original on the south bank of the Thames , opposite St Paul's Cathedral. The actors had little time to learn their roles and would not have seen the full script , which was kept carefully guarded for fear that it would be stolen by another theatre. There_ 's bound to be more evidence and we look forward to it. _ Notwithstanding his search for authenticity , Rylance's production will depart drastically from Shakespearian traditions. The cast of _ Two Gentlemen of Verona _ will include women and black actors , both unheard of in Shakespeare's day , and the play is set in modern Italy.
