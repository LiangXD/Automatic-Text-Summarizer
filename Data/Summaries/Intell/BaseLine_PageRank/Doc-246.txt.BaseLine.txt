I don't believe they have the culture to adequately service high-net-worth individuals, he adds. U.S. Trust recently introduced certain mutual-fund products, which allow it to serve customers with minimum deposits of $250,000. We have always taken smaller accounts, but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow, Mr. Schwarz says. Our bread and butter is still the $2 million to $20 million account, he says.

Schwarz but his family no longer has ties to the company. Donald M. Roberts, 54, treasurer, and Frederick S. Wonham, 58, who takes responsibility for the funds-service group, were named vice chairmen and will serve in the office of the chairman. James E. Bacon, 58, executive vice president, who has directed the funds-service group, will retire.
