USA : INSIGHT $- Dow tests critical support at 6600. Richard Jacobsen NEW YORK 1997-03-31 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was testing critical technical support at the 6600 level on Monday during a second session of steep losses. Comments: although this repeats the title, i think it also provides additional essential information - that of the losses. The 6600 level _ is very important and if it should happen to break that would mean 6300 , _ said Robert Dickey , technical analyst at Dain Bosworth. Ricky Harrington , technical analyst analyst , Interstate/Johnson Lane , pointed to 6400 as the next key support after 6600. A higher ratio would indicate investors are buying put options , which allow them to sell stocks at a specified price. However , Frank Gretz , technical analyst at Shields & Co , said the put/call ratio had picked up Monday morning.
