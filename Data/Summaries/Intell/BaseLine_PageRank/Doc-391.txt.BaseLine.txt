True, prisoners are now confined to 6-ft. by 8-ft. chain-link enclosures with concrete floors and tin roofs (Rumsfeld thinks it's pejorative to call them cages). But relief will come; in three months, the Pentagon hopes to replace the facility with something more permanent. (The caution makes sense; in 2000 Mamdouh Salim, an al-Qaeda operative awaiting trial in New York City for his part in the 1998 embassy bombings, used a comb to stab a prison guard through the eye.) So far, humanitarian groups have been muted in their criticism of the conditions at Guantanamo. Politicians and commentators in London are now clamoring that all held in Gitmo must be guaranteed treatment in accordance with international law. The Pentagon has resisted calling the detainees prisoners of war, preferring the terms unlawful combatants or battlefield detainees. Under the Geneva Convention, those holding true POWs are bound to release them at the end of hostilities; but that is the last thing the U.S. wants to do with men who may be al-Qaeda operatives. The Geneva Convention does contemplate that some irregular forces captured in battle need not be considered POWs. Some--the Pentagon won't say how many--were members of the Taliban and presumably thought they were part of the Afghan army. Washington says no, because the Taliban had no clear chain of command and was not a legitimate government. That may be so; unfortunately, as Amnesty International has pointed out, under the Geneva Convention the Pentagon has no business making such a determination. Those who fall into the enemy's hands are entitled to POW status until a competent tribunal has determined their status. Leaving the prisoners indefinitely beyond the reach of any legal regime, said the Economist last week, would put America--pre-eminently a nation of laws--itself outside the law.
