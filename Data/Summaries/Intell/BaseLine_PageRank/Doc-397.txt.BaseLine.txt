Britain's Prescott Pushes for Kyoto Pact Backing VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- The Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be ratified even without U.S. support, British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told an international conference on business and the environment on Friday. This is the world's best chance of dealing with a very serious threat to it, Prescott told delegates from 65 nations at the Globe 2002 conference in Vancouver that ended on Friday. The Kyoto Protocol calls on countries to reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are blamed by many scientists for global warming, to pre-1990 levels by 2012. Named for the Japanese city where it was approved, the pact was signed by 84 countries, including the United States and Canada. Fifty-five countries responsible for 55 percent of emissions in 1990 must ratify it for it to take effect. Europe's environment ministers have agreed that all 15 EU nations should adhere to the Kyoto Protocol.
