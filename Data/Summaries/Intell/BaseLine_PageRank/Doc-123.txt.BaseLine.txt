28 (CNA) -- The Taipei-based Chinese Federation of Labor (CFL) attended the Asian regional meeting of the International Labor Organization (ILO) held Tuesday in Bangkok, mainly because of its work to protect foreign laborers in Taiwan. CFL President Lin Hui-kuan led the Taiwan delegation to the meeting in the name of observer of the International Confederation of Free Trade Union (ICFTU). The CFL's participation in the meeting did not meet with any objection from Beijing, as it attended as an observer of a non-U.N. organization. However, through the protests of local labor groups, foreign laborers' working rights were protected, bringing extra attention to the power of Taiwan labor groups.
