December 10, 1996 Dear Mailhouse donor reminder: You and I have done some important work together. We've helped people break free of the welfare cycle. We've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce. We've expanded Goodwill's proven methods to towns and neighborhoods where they are needed most. Of course, we've played different roles. You have helped make Goodwill's work possible with your previous support.
