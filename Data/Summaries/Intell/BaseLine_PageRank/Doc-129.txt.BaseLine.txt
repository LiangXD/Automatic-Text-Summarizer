On the afternoon of August 29, after several delays due to various causes, Japan successfully launched its H2A rocket No. This milestone puts Japan's aerospace development program back on track. Japan previously developed the L and M series of launch vehicles. However, these two rockets are primarily used to launch low orbit satellites. In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket. The Japanese aerospace community takes a great deal of pride in this achievement. This low cost approach brought about a series of satellite launch failures. In November 1999, a multi-purpose satellite was launched by H2 rocket No. 8. It did not enter its predetermined orbit and had to be destroyed. After this incident, Japan began to redesign the main engine of the H2 rocket. This satellite doubled the capacity of the test satellite previously launched by Japan. A Japanese made H2A rocket will launch this satellite in 2002. Military surveillance satellites are also included in its development plan. The power generated will then converted to microwaves to be received by microwave receiver stations on earth. Selene, a project that has a $200 million price tag, will be launched in 2003. In 1998, its revenue was 1.1 trillion yen, which represents a 10.5 percent market share worldwide. After two years of stalemate, the Japanese government recently reorganized its aerospace development agency. By 2010, Japan will increase its global market share in aerospace to 17.4 percent.
