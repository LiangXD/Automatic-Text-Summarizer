MMM F_NAME L_NAME TITLE COMPANY ADDRESS CITY,ST ZIP March 4, 1999 Dear LTR_NAME: CCI has come a long way in the last five years. We've worked hard to structrue the organization so that we've ready to move boldly into the next century, and I believe that we have an exciting and successful future ahead of us. It's clear that if we don't increase our base of private funding, we won't have the kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers and the very important services they offer. Where else would that many people turn if CCI weren't there to help? The community initiatives committee is working with our development office to put together a long-range fundraising plan that will ultimately bring more money into our centers.
