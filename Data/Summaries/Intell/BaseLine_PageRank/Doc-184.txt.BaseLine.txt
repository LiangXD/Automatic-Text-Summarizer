Attorney General Francisco Cayuela confirmed that preliminary investigations indicate that the gang of Mexican Saul 'El Guero' Medina specialized in smuggling illegal aliens from the Middle East, in addition to car theft. The Ministerial Police discovered that the El Guero Medina's gang operated from Matamoros and had branches in India, Brazil, Guatemala, Pakistan, Honduras, and El Salvador. Narvaez explained that the FBI has requested information on this gang, which used false documents such as resident cards, licenses, social security numbers, and seals of the State of Texas Justice Department.
