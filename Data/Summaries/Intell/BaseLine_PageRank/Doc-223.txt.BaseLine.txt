Mr Jaume Matas, Minister for Environment, Spanish Presidency of the EU Mrs Margot Wallstrom, Commissioner for Environment, European Commission It is clear that the proposals for US action on climate change are domestic. On the contrary, the Kyoto Protocol requires most industrialised countries to achieve absolute emission reductions, while they still foresee to have growing economies. Achieving this would only be a first step towards stabilising global greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous climate change. However, the new plan does not lead to such a stabilisation, but instead will lead to the increase of absolute emission levels. Over the past years, greenhouse gas emissions intensity in relation to GDP has been falling in the US. While the intensity improvements may reduce this to around 33%, this is still a very substantial increase in absolute emissions. It is striking that the approach which is considered beneficial for other air pollutants, namely to implement cap-and-trade programmes, is not extended to CO2 emissions from the power sector.
