Sun, a maker of computer workstations, reported sales of $538.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. Earlier this month, the company said it expected to break even for the quarter on sales of $530 million. In a statement, Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive officer, said the company's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April. One of those new computers, called Sparcstation 1, accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter, he said.
