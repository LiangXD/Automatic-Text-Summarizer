For 10 days, the second Belgian astronaut will get to the International Space Station [ISS] on board the brand new Russian Soyuz TMA-1 space ship. On Thursday [29 November] the Belgian Government formally committed itself, vis-a-vis its Russian and European partners (the European Space Agency [ESA]), to pay Frank De Winne's ticket into space. The highway to the stars is looking radiant for the Belgian cosmonaut. So, if that should prove necessary, De Winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship. In several weeks, he learned the indispensable bases of the Russian language. He is making appreciable efforts to meet the other foreign cosmonauts who are in training there and share his experiences. People there are really unanimous about him, she told us. An initial segment of 2.5 million euros (Frank's training costs) will reportedly be paid in the next few days. Several avenues have been explored to collect the overall amount. The SSTC's overall budget will not suffer from this. Cancellation Insurance Budgets will remain constant, explained Eric Beka, the SSTC's secretary general. This should insure that we can recover the sums involved, that in the prospect of another space trip. About 10 years ago, Dirk Frimout was the first Belgian astronaut to go into earth orbit. As Picque emphasized, for many years, each franc invested by Belgium in space has brought in three francs.
