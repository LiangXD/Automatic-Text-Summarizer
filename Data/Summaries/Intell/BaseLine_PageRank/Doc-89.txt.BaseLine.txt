Among those previously rumored are Amoco Corp and BP America , both companies which have a major presence in the middle of the U.S. where Ashland is concentrated. Ashland , under pressure last year from investor Providence Capital to improve its performance , announced a major restructuring in December. Also in this group are 750 company-owned outlets ( SuperAmerica , Ashland ) plus a 523-store branded jobber network , the Valvoline motor oil business and pipeline and other distribution assets mainly grouped under Scurlock Permian interests. Ashland , after appointing CS First Boston advisor last December , said earlier this month that it is seeking an initial public offering ( IPO ) of 3.1 million shares in its exploration unit , Blazer Energy Inc. The company plans to offer 82.3 percent of the company to Ashland Inc shareholders after offering 17.7 percent in the IPO. Blazer Energy consists of an Appalachian natural gas operation and about 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil production in Nigeria.
