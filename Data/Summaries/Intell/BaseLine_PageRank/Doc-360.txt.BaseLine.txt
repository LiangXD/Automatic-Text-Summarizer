The Federal Government denied that the agreement, signed this week, was a signal it was dumping the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gases. The Australian-US climate action partnership involves liaison between governments, businesses and research bodies on climate change. The Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, said yesterday that Australia should not follow the US position on climate change. Mr Blair told the ABC that greenhouse gases were an area where there was an obvious disagreement with the US.
