We have taken custody of these individuals due to our concern about their activity in BiH, which both posed a credible security threat to US personnel and facilities and demonstrated involvement in international terrorism, it said. Washington insisted it would not have acted without credible evidence, but the transfer exposed it to more criticism from campaigners who have accused it of disregarding human rights in its declared war on terror. Not only had a court ordered their release on Thursday but the state's top human rights body had instructed authorities to prevent four being taken out of the country by force. It's very disappointing, Madeleine Rees, head of the Bosnia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said of the operation. Washington is already under fire from human rights groups for its treatment of prisoners captured in Afghanistan and held at Guantanamo Bay. All were Algerians, although one also had a Yemeni passport possibly obtained fraudulently, international officials said. Local police arrested them in October, acting on a US tip after threats closed the US and British embassies for several days. International officials said US officials had not been willing to provide Bosnia's justice system with the intelligence information that prompted their detention. They tried to block vehicles presumably taking the suspects to hand them over to US forces.
