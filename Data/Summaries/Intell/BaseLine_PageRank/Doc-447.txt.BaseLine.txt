And this time of year is an occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are. We do this through a wide range of programs including community- based, therapeutic foster care, group homes and our treatment center. Many of the children have no homes; no memories of joy from past holidays. Others are from families that are struggling to provide a healthy, happy environment but don't have the resources to make it possible. It can help purchase clothing, school supplies, books and educational tools throughout the year. We wish you and your family a new year full of joy and love.
