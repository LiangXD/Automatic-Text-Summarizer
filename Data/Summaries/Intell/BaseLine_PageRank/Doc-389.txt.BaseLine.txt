Even so, enough leaked out to illuminate President Bush's policy, which has been consistent ever since he enunciated it during his campaign for the presidency. The centerpiece was a visit by Taiwan's defense minister, Tang Yao-ming, the first since President Carter switched U.S. diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979. That Tang was invited was more evidence that Bush has adopted the most pro-Taiwan posture of any president in nearly a quarter century; his stance differs distinctly from that of President Clinton, who tilted in favor of Beijing. After talking with Wolfowitz for two hours, Tang said he had guaranteed that his government would by no means take any provocative step toward China. Among them, they make every weapon Taiwan could possibly want to fend off the expanding might of China. Dennis Blair, who commands U.S. forces in the Pacific, told Congress recently: The PLA (Peoples Liberation Army) is still years away from the capability to take and hold Taiwan. The Republican election platform reflected the candidate's policy: All issues regarding Taiwan's future must be resolved peacefully and must be agreeable to the people of Taiwan. Whatever decision Bush makes, a defense official said, the Pacific Command is ready to respond to any potential crisis, including the use of force against Taiwan by China. The critical question: Will the Chinese, noting American military operations in Afghanistan, heed these warnings or will they miscalculate and try to call Bush's bluff?
