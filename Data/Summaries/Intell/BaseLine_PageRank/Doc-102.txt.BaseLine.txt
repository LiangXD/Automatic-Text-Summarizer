San Francisco 49ers quarterback Alex Smith joins search for missing California girl Sierra LaMar San Francisco 49ers quarterback Alex Smith has reportedly joined the search for a missing California girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago on her way to school. He was there to search, Marc Klaas, founder of the KlaasKids Foundation, told the newspaper. By showing up, he provided a value that went well beyond his own presence as a searcher.

The potential evidence, part of a series of items discovered by volunteers, will be sent to the county crime lab for testing, authorities said. She last was seen March 16 leaving her home at around 7:15 a.m. to walk to a school bus stop. Police said the last text LaMar sent out was shortly before 7 a.m. the day she disappeared, and it was not a distress text. Her pants and shirt were found neatly folded inside the Juicy brand bag, though it's not known whether those are the clothes she was last seen wearing, police said. Police said they have interviewed registered sex offenders in the area near where LaMar was last seen. The girl's father, Steve LaMar, who lives some 40 miles away in Fremont, is a registered sex crimes offender but is not considered a suspect in the case.
