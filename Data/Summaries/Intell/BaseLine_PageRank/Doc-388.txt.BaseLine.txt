Jordan to sign Kyoto Protocol AMMAN - Jordan said it will sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact on impeding global greenhouse gas emissions, following a recent Cabinet decision, according to Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP). Soon, the government will delegate Jordan's representative to the United Nations, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, to sign the protocol, Juneidi told The Jordan Times on Tuesday, adding that an exact date for signing of the environmental agreement had not been set. Although developed countries are the world's main source of large-scale air pollution, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is aimed at stressing its commitment towards the different international conventions, Juneidi said.
