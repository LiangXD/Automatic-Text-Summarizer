Police said four grenades were thrown into a crowd of up_to 200 protesting against alleged corruption in the judiciary. Protest leader and apparent target Sam Rainsy , who narrowly escaped injury , on Sunday blamed the attack on his bitter foe , co-Premier Hun Sen. Security and political instability , exacerbated by the rivalry of co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen , compound the challenges of an incomplete commercial code , corruption and war-scarred infrastructure , analysts said. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party ( CPP ) formed an uneasy coalition government with the royalist FUNCINPEC after U.N.-organised elections in 1993. Diplomats and business representatives said they had received numerous phone calls from worried investors and prospective investors since Sunday's attack.
