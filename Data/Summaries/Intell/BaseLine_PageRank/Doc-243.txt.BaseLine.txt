John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5% annually through the next three years. Since 1983, Westinghouse has shed 70 businesses that it didn't expect to produce 10% operating margins while acquiring 55 businesses. Even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of 2% to 2.5%, we can handle that, Mr. Marous said. A bright spot is the company's power-generation business, which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years. Mr. Marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company's target goal of 8.5%. The company's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mr. Lego said. Westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to 25% of total corporate sales from 20% last year.
