ANKARA (A.A) - 21.12.2001 - Yasin Hatiboglu, Deputy Chairman of the SP [Felicity Party]'s Parliamentary Group, claiming that countries in which the programs of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] are implemented experience the same fate, has said that the government must see the social explosion that has occurred in Argentina. Hatiboglu began a press conference he held at the TBMM [Turkish Grand National Assembly] by saying that I hope that Mr. [State Minister for the Economy Kemal] Claiming that Indonesia, Malaysia, and Argentina, in which IMF programs were implemented, have all suffered the same fate, Hatiboglu called for taking lessons from the developments in Argentina. Hatiboglu spoke as follows: This government must finally see the Argentine government, and the social explosion that has befallen Argentina. Yesterday, Argentina as well was being portrayed as if everything there were going fine. Noting that a temporary golden age had been experienced in Argentina, Hatiboglu said that The IMF knows very well how to calculate just when it will deliver the actual death blow. With these three musketeers [a reference to the three-party coalition government], this country can only be dragged along, but won't get anywhere.
