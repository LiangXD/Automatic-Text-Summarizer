Pakistan rejects US human rights report ISLAMABAD - Pakistan Tuesday slated US State Department's country report on human rights situation in Pakistan and labelled it factually inaccurate and unwarranted. The report fails to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives by the Government of Pakistan to promote and protect human rights, a Foreign Office spokesman said. The spokesman said: The Government has amended Pakistan Citizenship Act of 1951 to enable women of Pakistani descent to claim Pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. Pakistan also ratified ILO Conventions 100 on equal remuneration and 182 on the elimination of worst forms of child labour.
