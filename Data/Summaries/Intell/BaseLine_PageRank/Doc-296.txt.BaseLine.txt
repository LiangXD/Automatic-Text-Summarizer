Chinese space exploration: When will a Chinese cosmonaut fly into space? Shenzhou-3 orbited the Earth 108 times, and successfully landed on the targeted site in inner Mongolia: the Chinese space program is developing. The 47th congress of the International Federation of Astronautics that took place six years ago in Beijing was remarkable for the large number of cosmonauts who participated. There was even an Austrian there, but the country who organized the forum, the third country on the rating of space explorers, was not represented. Here is an interesting detail from his unpublished Moscow speech that was delivered to Chinese students studying in Russia. Xuesen continued his studies at California Technical University, having obtained a Doctor of Astronautics degree, and, as the say, the title of US Air Force colonel. FBI agents caught him and his wife at the airport of Los Angeles, as well as luggage that contained 896 pounds of books and records. Xuesen was released only after five years only, after the quarantine during which he was not allowed access to the secret information. The Chinese students who graduated from Russian universities and Soviet experts of nuclear and missile technologies. The committee of the competent departments prepared seven variants with the help of Soviet experts. The construction of the Jiuquan cosmodrome was started there; it was put into operation at the end of 1958. Shenzhou-2 blasted off on January 10, 2001, staying about a week in the orbit, having flown 108 times around the planet. China knows how to build its own spaceships, and there are people who can become cosmonauts. As China's experts believe, there should be at least four test unmanned flights performed before they can launch a man into space.
