It's hard enough for her to make good decisions when she's surrounded by support. Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring, responsible adult volunteers with at-risk girls, ages 8-14. This money maintains the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships. This includes a volunteer screening process, orientation, training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff. Imagine the difference the community could make if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match! Sincerely, Dr. Linda McCoy Pastor, THE GARDEN A Blossom of St. Luke's United Methodist Church
