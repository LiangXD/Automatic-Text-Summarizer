COTABATO CITY - An alleged member of Nur Misuari's elite force said Saturday there is a plan to rescue their jailed leader. MacArthur Rasul, who claims to be a spokesperson of Misuari's Mutallah Force, said the group was just waiting for orders to mount the rescue operation. Rasul told Radio Mindanao Network here that some 1,000 members of the Misuari force have been on standby and are prepared to spring their leader from detention in Sta. Our field commanders are just waiting for orders from the higher hierarchy, Rasul said. If Chairman Misuari would go against (the rescue), we cannot do otherwise (but follow) because he is our commander in chief, he said. But while admitting to the plot, Rasul said Misuari's followers were also appealing to the Macapagal administration to free their leader. Local Government Assistant Secretary Abraham Iribani called on Saturday for sobriety among Muslim leaders and Moro National Liberation Front commanders amid alleged attempts by certain groups to start a religious war over Misuari's detention. We should remain calm and let the law take its course, Iribani, designated government spokesperson for Misuari's case, said he told a group of Muslim leaders and MNLF commanders in a dialogue in Zamboanga City. Some Moro groups had claimed Misuari's detention was an affront to the Muslim people and should be cause for a Muslim war. Dialogue The local government official held a dialogue with the Muslim leaders to officially report to them Misuari's status and answer their questions about his arrest and detention. Iribani also dismissed reports that renegade MNLF commanders were plotting to stage bomb attacks in Mindanao and Metro Manila to protest Misuari's arrest. The deportation of Misuari by Malaysia also drew flak from opposition legislators who warned that it could trigger a reaction in the government's peace efforts.
