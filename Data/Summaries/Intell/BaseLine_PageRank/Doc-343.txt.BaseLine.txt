Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami, said she supported the idea, in part, because it would underscore the naval base's strategic importance at a time when some members of Congress have urged returning the territory to Cuba. During the 1994-95 rafter crisis, 50,000 Cubans and Haitians were housed there in a tent encampment after U.S. naval vessels had picked them up at sea. The biggest challenge may be getting prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean. Then, the concern was how to make comfortable traumatized victims of civil war uprooted from a violent, cold climate. Planners scrambled to deploy healthcare workers and Muslim clergymen before the White House abandoned that idea. "All of this is pretty well-planned out because we have used it to house illegal migrant detainees in the past, Cubans and Haitians," Lucas said. SLICE OF U.S. With an outdoor movie theater, bowling alleys, a McDonald's and a mini-mall, Guantanamo Bay is a curious slice of Americana on the edge of the Caribbean. As of 1999, 2,400 civilians were on the base, including the families of the sailors and Marines who manage the port and patrol the fence line that separates the base from communist-ruled Cuba. On rare occasions, Cuban defectors get there by swimming through dangerous waters or by traversing a Cuban minefield. Some Washington diplomats consider giving back the land a potential carrot for negotiation with a democratic Cuban government. Ros-Lehtinen suggested Thursday that the move might raise the hackles of Cuba's government, but Rumsfeld dismissed those concerns.
