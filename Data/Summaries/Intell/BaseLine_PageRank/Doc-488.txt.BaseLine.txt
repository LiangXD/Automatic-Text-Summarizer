JAMMU, Apr 2 -- Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah today accused Pakistan army for breeding terrorism in India to remain in power against the wishes of their people who want peace. The ultras were indulging in blood-shed and their lunaticism has touched such heights that they were not even sparing the worship places, he said and referred to the attack in Raghunath bazaar and temple complex. Dr Abdullah also dwelt on the spread of education saying that teaching younger generation means steering the nation to prosperity and progress. 'Concentrate on those today who are the builders of nation tomorrow', he asked the teachers community while appreciating the involvement of parents in career building of their wards. He called for launching a coaching class for various competitive exams, as the area has no such facility. In this regard, he said, a Rs 400 crore scheme had been prepared a few years back that is currently under process for implementation. Among others present were, Mr. Mohammed Syed Akhoon and Mrs Bimla Luthra, MLAs [Ministers of Legislative Assembly] besides students and parents.
