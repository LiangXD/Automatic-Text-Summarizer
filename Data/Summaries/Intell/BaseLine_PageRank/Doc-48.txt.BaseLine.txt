Keiko Takagi TOKYO 1997-03-31 Japan's carmakers are weathering turmoil in the palladium market , including a halt in Russian shipments to Japan and volatile prices , without major changes in their purchasing practices , industry sources say. Usually, I would have marked industry sources say in s1 as to be removed, but here it is vital for the next sentence to make sense.] They also saw few reasons at this stage why the recent difficulties should lead carmakers to reduce the amount of palladium they use in automobile engines. Japanese traders said on Monday they still had not heard from the Russian export agency as_to when talks might be held. A spokesman for Honda Motor Corp said his company had already secured the palladium supplies it needs for the next six months through a contract with a Japanese trade house. This buying helped push palladium prices above $160 an ounce in mid-March for the first time in 1-1/2 years , compared with $120 to $125 in January. She added that recent supply disruptions and price rises were unlikely in the near term to encourage carmakers to cut use of palladium in favour of other platinum group metals.
