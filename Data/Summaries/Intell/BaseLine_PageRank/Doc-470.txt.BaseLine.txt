Israeli Arab leaders yesterday pledged to fight a proposed 25%-30% cut in National Insurance Institute child benefits for those who have not served in the army or completed national service. Shawqi Khatib, chairman of the monitoring committee of the Israeli Arab leadership, said Arabs would be hardest hit if the government approves the cutbacks in child benefits. Khatib, who also chairs the forum of Arab council heads, said the leadership is diametrically opposed to any cutbacks, particularly when those affecting the lower socio-economic strata of society. This is likely to have ramifications for the future, with children skipping school, going out onto the streets, and getting mixed up with crime, drugs, and violence. We applauded this move because it was not only just, but it made us begin to feel that we, as Arabs, were an integral part of Israeli society.
