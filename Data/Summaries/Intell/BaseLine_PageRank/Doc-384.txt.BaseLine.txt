Mugabe wins poll, amid claims of rigging HARARE, March 13 (AFP) - Zimbabwe's long-time ruler Robert Mugabe swept to victory Wednesday in Presidential elections in a vote that challenger Morgan Tsvangirai declared was rigged and unacceptable. Registrar General Tobaiwa Mudede announced on state television that Mugabe was re-elected with 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,758 votes for Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Observers had warned that should the outcome be seen to have been rigged, violence could explode across the volatile southern African nation. As the results were being announced, about 100 heavily armed soldiers moved into Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayao and surrounded the MDC offices, where opposition officials had gathered. Police roadblocks were seen on the main roads leading to central Harare, security forces were patrolling the city and six police officers were stationed outside MDC headquarters. Foreign governments all but dismissed the outcome even before it was announced, threatening to leave Mugabe internationally isolated despite his victory. British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw cited 'pretty strong' evidence that Mugabe has 'stolen' Zimbabwe's vote, an outcome he said would have 'enormous implications for the nature of our relationship with Zimbabwe.' US State Department spokeswoman Lynn Cassel said: 'While we must wait for the final results, it is abundantly clear that this was a seriously flawed election.' Polling stations in Harare were reduced by 32 per cent in favour of an increase of voting outlets in rural areas, considered Mugabe's support base.
