Modern observations are more conservative but no less intriguing. With such thoughts in mind , three zoologists led by M. K. Yousef of the University of Nevada gathered recently in Australia to investigate the camel '_ s fuel economy. The researchers _' aim was simply to measure the amount of oxygen consumed by the camels under various conditions. Once the zoologists had taken account of the difference in weight , the camels emerged as clear winners. Although large animals are generally more efficient at walking than small ones ? just as trains outperform cars ? the camel is in an altogether different league. It uses less than three-quarters of the energy expected of a mammal of its size. Most animals increase their fuel consumption in proportion to the extra baggage they are carrying , but not the camel. When Alexander the Great looted Persepolis in 330BC , he wisely enlisted 500 camels to carry the booty. Equally perceptively , Napoleon Bonaparte founded his own crack camel corps after studying the progress of a desert caravan. Zoologists have yet to establish the precise mechanisms behind the camel '_ s fuel economy. Camels operate each foreleg and its associated hindleg in unison , more_like a pantomime horse than a regular quadruped. 1080. ) Forelegs good-and hind legs too ? secret of the dromedary '_ s success
