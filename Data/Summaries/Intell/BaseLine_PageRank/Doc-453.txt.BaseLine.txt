I'm ready to go back, Vittori told Italian general Mario Arpino during a telephone call shortly after the Russian Soyuz space capsule made its touch-down in Kazakhstan. Russian officials said the three men, including the world's second space tourist South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, were in fine condition. He became the world's second space tourist, after US businessman Denis Tito made a similar voyage a year ago. Vittori, 37, spent eight months at Russia's Star City in preparation for his 10-day mission, dubbed Marco Polo by the Italian Space Agency.
