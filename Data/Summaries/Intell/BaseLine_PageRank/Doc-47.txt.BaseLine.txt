Eiichiro Tokumoto TOKYO 1997-03-31 East Asian grain buyers are largely holding back on their corn purchases ahead_of key impending U.S. agricultural data , dealers said on Monday. Japanese dealers have already finished buying their April/June requirements of U.S. corn , but so_far have only covered 10 percent of their July/September shipments. Regional demand for Chinese corn though , remains generally good on attractive prices relative to U.S.-origin and South Korean buyers dismissed talk of imports from China being pinched by logistical log jams. _ We have not seen any problem with Chinese corn deliveries to our clients , _ one trader in Seoul said. A trader with South Korea's National Livestock Cooperatives Federation ( NLCF ) also dismissed the market talk. _ We have heard ( of ) the rumour but there is no problem. _ Since January , South Korean buyers have bought at_least 1.022 million tonnes of Chinese corn through tenders and private negotiations , traders said. But other Japanese buyers are holding off believing Chinese offers are still too high. _ Chinese corn is not cheap enough , with freight costs around $20 ( a tonne ) China is just trying to export corn to solve their storage problem in corn growing regions , not to earn hard currency , _ another corn trader in Tokyo said. South Korean flour makers Cheiljedang Corp and Dongah Flour Mills Co Ltd are expected to tender this week to buy 23,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat for shipment between May 5 to June 5 , traders said.
