It's not another ice age, but at least it's cooler As countries gear up for battles over ratifying the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a recent study suggests that the world already has stepped along the path to a future cooler than it might have been. Researchers at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York report that declining greenhouse-gas emissions since the late 1980s have slowed the growth rate of the atmosphere's ability to retain heat. The researchers link the slower rate to implementation of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, in which countries agreed to phase out production of gases that erode the Earth's protective ozone layer. Known collectively as chlorofluorocarbons, these gases also trap heat thousands of times as effectively as carbon dioxide - the main focus of Kyoto. By focusing on carbon dioxide, the pact sets its sights on curbing the greenhouse gas held most responsible for contributing to the climate's warming during the past century.
