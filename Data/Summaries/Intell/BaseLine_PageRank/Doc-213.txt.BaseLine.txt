Govt dismisses US rights report GOVERNMENT yesterday trashed a US human rights report which lists a number of human rights violations in Namibia at the hands of security forces and Government. Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute responded that the US government was the worst human rights violator in the world. Shivute cited the American detention of 300 people at a US naval base at Guantanamo Bay without bringing them to trial. During arrests and detentions, security force members reportedly tortured and beat citizens who were suspected of complicity with Unita, the report says. It also cites cases of arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearance of people, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, arbitrary arrest, and denial of a fair public hearing.
