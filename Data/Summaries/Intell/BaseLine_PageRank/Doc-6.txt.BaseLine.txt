Tatiana Vacova BRATISLAVA 1996-08-20 Measures by the National Bank of Slovakia to ease the country's money supply may not be working , as a mounting liquidity surplus continues to drive prices down on the money market , analysts said on Tuesday. Last month , the NBS drove interbank interest rates to over 14 percent when , in a move to curtail banks' short-term lending , hiked minimum reserves significantly as_of August 1. That , dealers said , in tandem with an earlier hike in the Lombard rate to 15 percent from a previous 13 percent , appears to be backfiring as speculative capital floods the country taking advantage of attractive real interest rates and a steady currency. No official figures are available yet , but analysts estimate that some six billion crowns flooded onto the market from the reserves , while the same amount entered through maturing NBS liquidity bills , another NBS sterilisation tool.
