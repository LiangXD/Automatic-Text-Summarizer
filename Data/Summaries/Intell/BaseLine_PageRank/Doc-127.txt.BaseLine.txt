Without armed violence the Nazi regime and similar forces that had the wind in their sails in Europe in the 1930s, would not have fallen. The many and often confusing reports we have received over recent weeks on who may be responsible for the attacks already allows a clear pattern to be detected. But to build this strategy, targeted attacks on the infrastructure available to Bin Ladin were necessary. The United States and its principal allies have acted with exceptional caution over recent weeks to the unbelievable provocation of the 11 September attacks. The coming days will reveal whether or not they were effective, were sufficiently precisely targeted and limited in scope. But they cannot be any real talk of success until the broad strategy against terrorism begins to bear fruit. A strategy that worldwide must include both a degree of repression but most importantly constructive and positive measures.
