As usual, the US State Department published its annual report on human rights practices in world countries last Monday. And as usual, the portion about China contains little truth and many absurdities, exaggerations and fabrications. The United States was slandering China again, said Xirao-Nima, a professor of Tibetan history at the Central University for Nationalities. But it nevertheless uses human rights issues to slander China, CSSHR President Zhou Jue said. I have seen the truth there, which is very different from what some US politicians with ulterior motives have described, said Xirao-Nima, who is a Tibetan. Some Westerners who have been there have also seen the ever-improving human rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region, he added. After visiting the region several times, Italian senator Renzo Gubert, praised the Chinese Government's efforts to protect the indigenous cultural and religious heritage while developing the local economy. From 1989 to 1994, the central government invested 53 million yuan (US$6.4 million) to repair the Potala Palace. Later spent another 4.9 million yuan (US$590,360) to update the palace's fire safety facilities. Renzo Gubert once said that what impressed him most is that local Tibetans enjoy a high level of religious freedom. Throughout the report, there are many doubtful phrases, such as 'according to credible reports', 'various sources' and 'anecdotal evidence,' to name a few. It shows that these so-called truths are not true at all, said Xirao-Nima. To back up their reckless conclusion, the report lists many incidents where it said religious freedom was violated.
