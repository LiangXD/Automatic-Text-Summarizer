In January of this year , chief financial officer Gary Vilchick told analysts he saw a return to _ historical _ profitability in late 1997 or early 1998. Spyglass is striving to connect a wide range of _ devices _ to the Internet $-- everything from gas pumps to vending machines to cellular phones. A vending machine company , for_example , would be able to keep tabs from headquarters on the stocks in all its machines. Although the company has already announced major contracts such as a recent deal signed with Xerox Corp , the licensing revenues may take longer to come in , Spyglass said. The company said its profitability projections may be conservative , but as the market is young it is still difficult to identify when licensing revenues will begin to come in.
