White House spokesmen said Bush's blunt language during his State of the Union Address Tuesday did not mean that U.S. military action against any of the three was imminent. But the president's remarks clearly expanded the scope of his anti-terrorism campaign while elevating the fight against the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons to a major foreign-policy priority, U.S. officials said. The president told Congress that Iran, Iraq and North Korea pose "a grave and growing danger" because they seek weapons of mass destruction and have links with terrorist groups. President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, whose attempt at reforms have gotten American support, accused the United States of "warmongering." "He spoke arrogantly, humiliatingly, aggressively and in an interfering way -- and worse than anything, it is an insult to the Iranian nation," Khatami said at a Cabinet session Wednesday night. Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, responding to Bush's "axis of evil" remark, said the U.S. government "is the source of evil" in the world. And North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) monitored in Seoul had this to say: "The remarks were merely a shenanigan aimed at continuing with its policy of agression against us." Secretary of State Colin Powell and other officials had expressed optimism that Tehran's moderate behavior after the Sept. 3. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had particularly harsh words for Iran Wednesday, saying it had been training terrorists "for a long time."
