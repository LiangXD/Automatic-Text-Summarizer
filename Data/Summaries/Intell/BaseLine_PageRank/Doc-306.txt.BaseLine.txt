Hardly had observers even time to get used to the news that Hugo Chavez had lost his presidential post, and then he returned to power. There were already several suppositions that Hugo Chavez may recover the position, but nobody could suppose the recovery would be so quick. The majority of the population, who was not delighted with Chavez, was not on their side as well. Ordinary Venezuelans are even less happy with the generals and local oligarchic elite. The planners committed one more mistake when they dissolved the National Assembly and Supreme Court right after the coup. Carmona and other generals who participated in the coup are now being questioned by public prosecutors. At the same, the Venezuela government declared that participants of the coup will be brought to trial. The belt had been especially manufactured in Spain and was later left in the Miraflores presidential palace by the plotters. As for ordinary Venezuelans, they seem to be slightly anxious about the struggle for the presidential post. Neither supporters nor opponents of Chavez could be seen in the streets during the days of the coup.
