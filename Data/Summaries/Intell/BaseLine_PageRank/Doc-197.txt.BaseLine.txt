Riots and widespread strikes, attacks on government buildings, and the plundering of stores have left scores of dead and casualties. Foreign debts are around $132 billion and poverty is dominating the country like a dangerous virus. The main problem that caused the recent shock is also a result of the restrictive economic policies that have been adopted on the advice of IMF experts. Although IMF officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an IMF executive delegation is actively making changes to Argentina's economy. This country has attracted a large amount of foreign investment by international companies, from the American continent to Europe. Some $76 billion of the $132 billion debt is accounted for by foreign loans, which were lavished on Argentina.
