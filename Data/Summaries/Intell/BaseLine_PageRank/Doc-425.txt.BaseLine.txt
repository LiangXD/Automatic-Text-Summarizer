The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna Dear Joe, I know what you mean about being a journalist. I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes, so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need. Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories. Much of it, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some very good stories. In any case, there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons. I would posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur. So there, while you think of Case, you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives. That's ironic, since I think it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley. AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here, I am sure, since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati. From where I am sitting, I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age.
