The 450ft long vessel Nisha, carrying 26,000 tonnes [metric tons] of raw sugar, was stopped on Friday morning [21 December] amid fears it could be transporting noxious, hazardous or dangerous substances. But after a detailed examination of the ship, which is currently moored off the Isle of Wight, nothing suspicious was found, police said. It had recently stopped in the east African country of Djibouti, a neighbour of Somalia, which has been linked to Usama Bin Ladin's al Qa'ida terror network. Police had earlier indicated they expected the search to take a number of weeks, because of the vessel's size and design, but experts completed the job today. Anti-terrorist officers said they were also satisfied that the ship's crew and owners had not committed any offence. He added: We have not detected any signs of interference and we do not believe that the seals of the holds have been interfered with. Mr Veness praised the crew and ship's owners for their co-operation and said: We remain vigilant and are totally committed to ensuring the safety of the public.
