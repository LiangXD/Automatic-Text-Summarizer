The first choice is to commit ourselves to the constitutional path with all its obstacles. Mr Tsvangirai endorsed a United States proposal for targeted sanctions against President Mugabe and members of his Government but said full economic sanctions would be a ruinous mistake. The US Congress is set to consider the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Bill, which seeks to impose sanctions on Harare. But he opposed any steps that could plunge the country deeper into a recession that has already pushed unemployment, inflation and interest rates above 60 percent. Until such time as Mugabe actually subverts the electoral process - when one goes to that extreme, international sanctions will be an option. Mr Tsvangirai might face charges of contravening the Law and Order Maintenance Act for allegedly threatening to violently remove President Mugabe from power last year. The superior court has since heard State and defence arguments on the legality of the charges being laid against the opposition leader and reserved judgment. But if the appeal fails, the matter will be referred back to the High Court for trial.
