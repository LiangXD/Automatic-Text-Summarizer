Bradley Perrett CANBERRA 1996-08-21 Australia's new conservative government on Wednesday began selling its tough deficit-slashing budget , which sparked violent protests by Aborigines , unions , students and welfare groups even before it was announced. Earlier , about 150 protesting Aborigines had attacked police with bricks , bottles and stakes during a 20-minute confrontation near the Parliament House. As the protesters had feared , Costello revealed a cut to the government's Aboriginal welfare commission among the hundreds of measures implemented to claw back the deficit. The government's political opponents accused it of sleight of hand , taking from the public when it appeared to give. The budget's fate was not immediately clear , with minor parties refusing to guarantee passage through the Senate , the upper house of parliament. Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot said it was too early to say if her party would pass all measures.
