BEIJING: China played down sensitive differences with the United States over Taiwan on Thursday, with President Jiang Zemin holding his tongue over US commitments to arm the diplomatically-isolated island. Jiang's subdued tone, despite US pledges to press on with arms sales to Taipei and a defence summit with Taiwan officials next month, underlined his desire to avoid disputes with Washington ahead of a leadership handover this autumn. Jiang said Bush had restated Washington's long-standing commitment to Beijing's one China policy, which states that Taiwan and the mainland belong to a single country. We believe in peaceful settlement of this issue, Bush told a news conference after talks with Jiang on the first day of his visit. Taiwan relieved Chinese analysts who advise and comment on policy also played down tensions between China and the United States over Taiwan -- which Beijing always says is the most sensitive issue in their bilateral relationship. The democratic island run by President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party relies on the United States as its main arms supplier and trading partner. Speaking to Japan's Diet, or parliament, before heading to Seoul, Bush reassured Taiwan by saying: America will remember our commitments to the people on Taiwan.
