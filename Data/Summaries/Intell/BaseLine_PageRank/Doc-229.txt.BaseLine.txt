18 (Yonhap) -- The government on Monday announced its position on U.S. President George W. Bush's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions that he wants discussed internationally along with the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty adopted in 1997 to control greenhouse gas emissions. The Korean Government notes that the new U.S. Government initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and that it takes into consideration the concerns of developing countries, the statement said. In light of this, the Korean Government believes that consultations amongst the international community are needed to build understanding on the U.S. initiative, the statement noted, adding the Seoul government will actively participate in this process. Over 180 countries, including the United States, have prepared for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a framework that requires signatories to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the Bush administration had been severely blamed in the international community for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol.
