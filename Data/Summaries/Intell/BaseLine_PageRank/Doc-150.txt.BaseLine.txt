President Hugo Chavez has warned that certain sectors have once again taken up the idea of looking forceful way out in Venezuela, either through a coup or an attack that would end his life. He added that for that purpose they are seeking someone in the FAN [National Armed Forces] who could assume power in Venezuela. Since they have realized that this train is not stopping and that they are not going to stop it or run it off the track, ideas about destabilization have once again surfaced. Once again, ideas that Chavez has to be killed, that four shots would solve the problem, have emerged. The president charged that attacks targeting his person have gone on for over 10 years, and that he has been accused, among other things, of ties with the guerrillas, of buying arms and trying to set up a communist regime in Venezuela. Chavez said that more efforts would be made in 2002 to get the country moving ahead since he believes that it will be quite difficult politically, economically and socially. We were meddling in an internal conflict of another country, which is a violation of international law and which in turn gave the guerrillas the right to attack our military units.
