RJR Nabisco Inc. said it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle S.A.'s Nestle Foods unit for $370 million. Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a significant step in the company's divestiture program, as well as a a strategic divestiture. Since KKR bought RJR in February for $25 billion of debt, it has agreed to sell nearly $5 billion of RJR assets. RJR's executives have said they will dispense with certain brands, in particular, that aren't leaders in their markets. RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses, Mr. Gerstner said Friday. Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S., but RJR's overall share of the roughly $5.1 billion market is less than 5%.
