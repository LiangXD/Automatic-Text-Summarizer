Yet, some Americans and Brits have been hollering about the U.S. treatment of these tough guys. British newspaper headlines have screamed about U.S. Torture! and Monstrous Inhumanity, while stories say prisoners are treated like wild beasts in cages. The military wisely shackles prisoners during transport: That's when it's easiest for violent people to hurt others. Also, a British Foreign Ministry team, which spent three days at Club Gitmo, reported that three British citizens being held there had no complaints about their treatment. Still, some people just have to bash the United States. And they apparently don't care if the criticism makes them look clueless as to what really is inhumane. Does Amnesty International think that wearing a hood on an airplane is sensory deprivation, instead of a security measure? Then there's the reporter who asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld if American Taliban John Walker will be treated the same as the detainees. In an 8-by-8-foot space, (on some ships) we would cram half a dozen sailors, was one U.S. official's reaction. Some Brits and Amnesty International want them to be officially classified as POWs. You could understand the outrage if the U.S. military were torturing or otherwise mistreating the detainees.
