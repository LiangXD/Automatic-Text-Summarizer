Violent protests in Argentina; president Duhalde calls for calm BUENOS AIRES - President Eduardo Duhalde yesterday pleaded for patience as he works on the country's economic crisis. We can't solve all of the country's problems in three weeks, he told local radio, hours after tens of thousands of Argentines took to the streets around the country in a pot-banging demonstration. Duhalde, who took office on January 2 as Argentina's fifth president in a month, vowed his government would unveil a new economic program to rescue the country from four years of recession. The banking curbs were put in place December 1 by then-president Fernando De la Rua to halt a run on the banks. Late Friday night, Argentines' impatience peaked, and Duhalde faced the second and most widespread protest since he assumed the presidency after similar protests forced his predecessors from office. Thousands more crowded street corners and downtown streets in cities around the country, including Mar del Plata, Cordoba, Mendoza, Rosario and Salta. The protest marked the first organized protest, led by labor and neighborhood groups who also called for the protest via e-mail and the Internet.
