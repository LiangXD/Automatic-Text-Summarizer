The two companies also revealed changes to their merger proposal , first announced in November. Under the revised proposal , SembCorp will inject only its shipyard businesses , excluding some parts like its loss-making offshore engineering operations. Jurong will issue 27.6 million new shares to SembCorp at S$6.80 each for the assets to be injected. The offshore engineering assets were excluded because SembCorp's strategy and focus were different from Jurong's , a joint statement said. The merger , which needs the approval of shareholders and the Stock Exchange of Singapore , is expected to be sealed by the third quarter of 1997 , company officials said. He declined to say more but hinted the partner could be from outside Singapore. On market concerns that Jurong was getting the raw end of the deal by receiving additional yard capacity during a marine industry slowdown , Lua said : _ We recognised the cyclical nature of the industry.
