Canadian to join Endeavour crew OTTAWA - An Ottawa-born physicist will be the next Canadian in space. Allan Rock, the Industry Minister, announced yesterday that Steve MacLean, 47, has been assigned to fly aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour in April, 2003. The flight will be his second time in space. He will join other astronauts in four spacewalks to add trusses to the station and deploy additional solar panels. As capsule communicator, Dr. MacLean will relay information between the shuttle crew and Mission Control during flights. U.S. budgetary problems means plans to build a larger craft have been halted. Space agencies from Russia, Japan, Europe and Canada, partners in the space station program, will meet in March to discuss their concerns over its future. So it's very important for us to get back up to that crew size of six or seven.
