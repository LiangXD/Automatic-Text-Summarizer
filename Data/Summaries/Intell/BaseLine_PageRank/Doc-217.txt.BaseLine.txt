San Francisco, April 1 (CNA) -- Current relations between the Republic of China and the United States are in unprecedented good shape, the de facto ROC ambassador to Washington, D.C., said in Las Vegas Monday. Since the United States switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, ROC Representative to the United States Chen Chien-jen said substantive Taiwan-U.S. relations have never been as close as they are at the present time. Chen made the remarks at a luncheon given by himself in honor of directors and supervisors of the World Federation of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce (WFTCC), who were meeting in Las Vegas. In his view, Chen said, the ever firmer U.S. support for Taiwan partly stems from its recognition of the island's remarkable progress in democratization and liberalization.
