On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity, the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador, Colombia's second-largest newspaper. The paper's local administrator, Maria Luz Lopez, was shot dead, and her mother wounded, while her car was stopped for a red light. An hour later, the paper's circulation manager, Miguel Soler, was shot and killed near his home. The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspaper's offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin. They bombed the Bogota offices last month, destroying its computer and causing $2.5 million in damage. El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff. At Monterrey, publisher Luis Gabriel Cano, although shaken by the murders, issued a statement saying: We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking. The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions, but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today's editions. Noriega has closed every independent newspaper, radio and television station and arrested, tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters, the statement declared. Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid.
