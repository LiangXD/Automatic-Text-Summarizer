USA : OPTIONS $- FX vols climb despite lower dollar. CHICAGO 1997-03-31 Implied volatilities for dollar-pair options crept higher on Monday despite the dollar's retreat into familiar territory , puzzling traders and suggesting to some that a more decisive move lies ahead. One-month dollar/mark was quoted at 9.3/9.6 percent and one-week at 9.75/10.75 percent , also up substantially from levels late Thursday. A U.S. investor's large purchase of 130-yen puts with a six-month timeframe helped pull the entire volatility curve higher this morning , traders said. Many foreign exchange traders expect the Tankan report to set the next trend for the Japanese currency. The mixed views in the market were reflected in a shift in risk reversals in favor of yen calls , traders said.
