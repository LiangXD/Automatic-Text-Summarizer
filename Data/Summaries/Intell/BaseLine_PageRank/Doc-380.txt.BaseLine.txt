DESK TEHRAN -- President Robert Mugabe easily won Zimbabwe's election on Wednesday despite biased propaganda unleashed against him by some Western countries, accusing him of being unfair towards the opposition. Results announced by Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede at 0800 GMT showed Mugabe with 1,634,382 votes, well past the 50 percent of ballots cast that he needed to extend his 22-year rule for six more year. His challenger, former trade unionist Morgan Tsvangirai, trailed almost half a million votes behind. Mugabe's government has dismissed criticism of the poll, which Information Minister Jonathan Moyo called exemplary.
