Peronist to head Argentina at least till March elections BUENOS AIRES - Veteran Peronist Adolfo Rodriguez Saa was set to become the country's interim president yesterday, taking power after a devastating economic crisis toppled President Fernando de la Rua. Lawmakers meeting in a special session late yesterday were expected to approve the 54-year-old lawyer and provincial governor as president. The leader elected then will finish out the two years of de la Rua's term. His appointment would restore Argentina's largest party, the Peronists, as the country's dominant political force after the most widespread social disturbances since the late 1980s, when a previous financial crisis rocked this South American country of 36 million. Rodriguez Saa yesterday told the television network Todo Noticias he would announce an economic plan to ease the crisis. Argentines wary of surging unemployment, rising poverty, salary cuts and tax hikes are deeply skeptical of more calls for belt-tightening, the centerpiece of policies advocated by De la Rua and his economy minister Domingo Cavallo. That was the message the people sent to De la Rua and all the other political leaders.
