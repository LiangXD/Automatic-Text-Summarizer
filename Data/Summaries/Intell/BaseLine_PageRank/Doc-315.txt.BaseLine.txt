The track runs along a 44-foot girder that space shuttle Atlantis' astronauts delivered and bolted to the orbiting outpost last week. Ground controllers took over manual control and, a few hours later, were able to latch the railcar to the track. Space station astronaut Carl Walz sent another computer command from inside to get the railcar moving again. Again, ground controllers had to take over manual control to secure the car. It got to where it was going, but the automatic latching system shut down again and ground controllers had to step in as before. "I think what we're finding out as we go through this is how the mobile transporter works in zero-g," said Ben Sellari, a NASA manager.
