Amman -- Jordan, bound by environmental clauses in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, is currently mulling over signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming even though Washington turned down the protocol six months ago. He explained to The Jordan Times that in Jordan, we conclusively believe that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected. Certain steps have to be taken with regard to this objective -- including signing the Kyoto deal, he said. In 1992, Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention that compels nations to curb global warming, which is blamed on gases produced by factories and cars that burn fuel. But here, we are a developing country and we care about having clean industry...the whole world knows our position, [which is] to achieve sustainable development.
