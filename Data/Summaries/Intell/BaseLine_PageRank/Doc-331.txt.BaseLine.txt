According the Registrar-General's office, Mr. Mugabe received 56% of the 3.1 million votes cast to Mr. Tsvangirai's 41%. Mr. Tsvangirai was less complimentary, calling the election the biggest electoral fraud I have ever witnessed in my life. He said the result does not reflect the true will of the people of Zimbabwe. We foresaw electoral fraud but not daylight robbery, he said during a brief news conference yesterday. George Bush, the U.S. President led the criticism from the West, saying Washington would not recognize Mr. Mugabe's government. And we are dealing with our friends to figure out how to deal with this flawed election. Colin Powell, his Secretary of State, implied the United States may impose new sanctions in addition to an existing travel ban affecting Mr. Mugabe's inner circle. Jack Straw, Britain's Foreign Secretary, condemned Mr. Mugabe for waging a systematic campaign of violence. John Reynolds, the Canadian Alliance leader, said Zimbabwe should be suspended from the Commonwealth and its High Commissioner to Canada sent packing until we straighten this mess out. In contrast with the West, Zimbabwe's neighbours, including regional superpower South Africa, found little to object to in the election. The observer team from the Organization of African Unity announced that, in general, the elections were transparent, credible, free and fair. Mr. Mugabe has not been seen since Friday's pre-election rallies and made no appearance or comment yesterday. We have just got to sit down and brainstorm and come with something concrete to do. Although Mr. Tsvangirai said the people were seething with anger, Mr. Tsvangirai ruled out open rebellion. In many cases neither the MDC nor neutral observers were able to monitor voting in more remote polling stations. Zimbabwe's economy has imploded, unemployment is near 60%, inflation is running at 112% a year and many people in this former breadbasket are going hungry.
