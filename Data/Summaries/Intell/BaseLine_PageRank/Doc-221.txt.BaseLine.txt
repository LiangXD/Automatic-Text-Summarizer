US President Bush, after visiting Japan and South Korea, will follow with a visit to China. Whether Bush will, like Clinton, damage Taiwan's interests is receiving the deep concern of all quarters. The protection of Taiwan's interests under the US-Japan alliance structure is fairly strong. Before President Bush visits China, Japanese naval strategy expert Kawamura Sumihiko and missile expert Sato Mamoru were exclusively interviewed by a reporter of this newspaper. Last year, approximately 5.1 billion tons of goods passed through the world's oceans, about one third of which passed through the sea areas of southern China. Half of this one third was transported to Japan through the sea areas near Taiwan. If Taiwan becomes a part of China, all of Taiwan's sea areas will be threatened. Under these circumstances, Taiwan and Japan both must recognize clearly the important role of the navy. For example, there is only one submarine attached to each naval base. In past Taiwan-US arms sale negotiations, the PC-3 early warning aircraft and the MH53 helicopter that Taiwan has made requests to purchase are entirely suitable to Taiwan's needs. The PC-3's intelligence exchange system is extremely important and is not inferior to the Aegis destroyer. I reckon that at the last stage, the United States will provide the Aegis destroyer to Taiwan. Taiwan has some people who very obviously purposely play up China's use of force to scare Taiwan. In 1996, the Chinese People's Liberation Army indeed fired four missiles near Taiwan, but this was a kind of propaganda war. If China only uses common warheads, at most, it would only make a few holes in Taiwan. If warheads with biological weapons are used, China has no means to justify this to international public opinion. Sato: After the 9-11 incident, the United States will be even keener on developing TMD. There would be no difference between Taiwan announcing independence to the outside world and the current situation.
