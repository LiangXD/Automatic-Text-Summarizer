Barney Spender LONDON 1997-03-31 Christian Vieri had the honour of celebrating his international debut on Saturday by scoring Italy's 1,000th goal but another against Poland in Chorzow on Wednesday could have the greater long-term significance. Having already beaten England at Wembley , a win for Cesare Maldini's men would effectively secure their place at next year's World Cup finals in France. It would put them six points clear at the top of European group two with home games against their main challengers still to come. Maldini is likely to stick as closely as possible to Saturday's side although Lazio defender Alessandro Nesta and Parma striker Enrico Chiesa are out. But , after the 1-1 draw against Denmark , Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic has already rung the changes. Goalkeeper Drazen Ladic , responsible for Brian Laudrup's late equaliser , has gone not just from the starting line-up but from the bench as well. Top scorer Davor Suker will also be missing after collecting a second yellow card against the Danes while Robert Jarni and Zvonimir Soldo are struggling with injuries. Noises from the Greek camp suggest a_few nerves about the prospect of the trip to Sarajevo. _ My players are tired. Group four throws together the two leaders as Scotland , 2-0 winners over Estonia on Saturday , look to consolidate their place at the top with a win over Austria in Glasgow. Bulgaria can leapfrog Israel and Russia to take over at the top of group five if they beat Cyprus in Sofia.
