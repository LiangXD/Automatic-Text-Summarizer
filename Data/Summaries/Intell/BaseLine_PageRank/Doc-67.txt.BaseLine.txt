Shevardnadze had said last week that the peacekeepers would have to leave if Russia did not give Georgia , devastated by civil and ethnic conflict since it became independent in 1991 , more help in restoring control over Abkhazia. Dzhindzholia said Abkhazia would not allow the so-called _ security zone _ which is under the peacekeepers' control to be extended.
