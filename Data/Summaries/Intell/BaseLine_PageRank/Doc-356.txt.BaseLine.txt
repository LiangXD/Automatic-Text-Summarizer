Polar bears will have less room to roam, crowding some of them out of existence. Birds will start flying an extra mile north each year, and may starve when they get there. At no time was it clearer that countries should take steps to slow this process than when 150 countries signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. But now, with President George Bush saying the US will not ratify the protocol - which was shaped in part to fit Washington's concerns five years ago - the accord's ultimate effectiveness is in doubt, and many US allies are irritated. The clash over how to stop global warming while allowing sluggish economies to prosper occurs at an awkward point in US-Japanese relations. US analysts looking east say that as Japan's economic dominance in Asia diminishes, so will the importance of the US-Japan relationship as a whole. During Mr. Bush's visit here last month, Mr. Koizumi gently balked at the president's proposed alternative to the Kyoto agreement, saying that Japan would like to see further efforts on the part of the US. While there are no protesters in the streets, there is an air of indignation here over Washington's do-it-our-way decision on something that effects the whole globe. They fear that, because the US is forging its own way, smaller nations that are expected to ratify the Kyoto Protocol could start backing out. Any further policy to reduce emissions, he says will hurt Japanese industrial competitiveness. back to top Untitled Copyright @ 2002 The Christian Science Monitor.
