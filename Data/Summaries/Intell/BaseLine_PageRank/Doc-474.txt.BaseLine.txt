For instance, tourism will become the most rapidly developing field for the next two decades. Recalling that the new tender law had enabled everyone to join public investment tenders, Dervis said that Greek investors could benefit from the law. However, I do not mean that we overcame all problems. We also plan to decrease inflation from 70 percent to 35 percent." He is also scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Greek Development Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos. After his meeting with Greek businessmen, Dervis will come together with Greek Minister Yeoryios Paskhalidhis for Macedonia and Thrace on Monday.

For example, South America is not a good neighborly field, and therefore, all regional countries are suffering from difficulties." There were earlier iron curtain countries and their borders were definite. We do not know how Europe will develop towards southeast and east 15 or 20 years later." He said, "unfortunately, crises followed those rapid growth periods lasting for 3-4 years. Dervis came together with Greek Development Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos following the opening of the ceremony.
