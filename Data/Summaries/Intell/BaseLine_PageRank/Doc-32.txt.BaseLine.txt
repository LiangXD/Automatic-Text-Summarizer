Trucks , buses and most taxis use them , and 40 per_cent of vehicle fuel sold in the UK last year was diesel. Diesel engine manufacturers have long maintained that these are harmless , but recently they have been found to contain polyaromatich hydrocarbons ( PAH ) , which can cause cancer when breathed deeply. Diesel engines also produce nitrous ocxides ( NOx ) , which return from the skies as acid rain. It is small wonder that the truck and bus manufacturers based in areas hit worst by acid rain , Volvo and Scania in Sweden and MAN in Bavaria , are working hardest to cut pollutants. While many politicians have only recently seen their green light many diesel engine manufacturers have looked further ahead , and have been developing cleaner engines , principally in response to stringent American legislation. While the first level of cuts can be reached using existing levels of technology , the second stage , likely in 1994 , will require a new generation of engines. These will be electronically controlled , a technical task far harder on a diesel engine than on its petrol counterpart. Some manufacturers such as MAN and DAF have solved the problem by fitting filters which clean themselves with a small furnace as the vehicle is in operation. Unlike lead , which the fuel companies eventually proved only too pleased to take out_of petrol , sulphur does nothing for either the performance or longevity of diesel engines and it contributes to acid rain. Klaus Schubert , technicaldirector at MAN , says his company would like to see it reduced to 0.02 per_cent , but recognises that 0.05 per_cent is a more realistic level. London buses , for_example , are exempt from traffic lawsaffecting other vehicles , which in the competitive deregulated world of modern bus operation , include expensive pollution control.
