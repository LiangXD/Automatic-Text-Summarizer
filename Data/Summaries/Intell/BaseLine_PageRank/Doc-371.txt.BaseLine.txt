The unusual step was meant to punish President Robert Mugabe for his stewardship of elections this month that were widely criticized outside Africa as rigged. While less than an expulsion, the move still deepened the diplomatic isolation of Zimbabwe, which has already been battered by political violence, hunger, economic decline and the threat of labor unrest. It means Zimbabwean officials will be barred from meetings held by the Commonwealth, an organization that carries some cachet as an important club bridging the north-south divide. Yet it adds one more voice to those labeling Mr. Mugabe a pariah and increasing pressure on him to seek reconciliation, possibly through new elections. The opprobrium spread further today when Switzerland became the latest country to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe, in view of the manipulation of the presidential elections and ongoing human rights violations, the Swiss government said. Under other restrictions, Mr. Mugabe and Zimbabwe's most senior leaders are already barred from travel to the United States and the European Union. The response to Mr. Mugabe's behavior was seen by many outsiders as a token of South Africa's and Nigeria's own commitment to democracy as a way of fostering economic renewal. Yet many African politicians, including Morgan Tsvangirai, the Zimbabwe opposition leader defeated in the election, had expressed doubt that the Commonwealth would take any action at all. For all its critics say it is ineffective, the Commonwealth has nonetheless sought to project itself as an arbiter of democratic legitimacy among often delinquent members.
