NEW YORK 1997-03-31 U.S. crude oil prices are likely to remain entrenched in a weak range this week amid ample physical supplies , but analysts say the upcoming _ driving season _ could begin to mop up some of the excess.

Still , Saucer pointed out that refinery runs are beginning to pick up in anticipation of the summer driving season. _ The crude market wo_ n't be as sloppy as it has been _ in the weeks ahead , he said. London's International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) is closed today to observe Easter Monday , and some state-side traders have not yet returned to their offices. Sweet domestic cash grade differentials were talked slightly weaker , reflecting the resolution of last week's hostage crisis at Royal Dutch/Shell's operations in the Niger Delta. The disturbances shut down some 210,000 barrel per day ( bpd ) of Nigerian production from top equity producer Royal Dutch/Shell's operations , or about 10 percent of the country's total flows.
