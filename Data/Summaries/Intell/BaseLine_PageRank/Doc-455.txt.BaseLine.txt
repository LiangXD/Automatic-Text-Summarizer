Nairobi, April 26 Kyodo -- A Kenyan national working for Japan's leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper was shot dead Thursday night in Nairobi in a botched car robbery, police sources said Friday. Julius Ndegwa, 43, was confronted by a group of armed gangsters around 10 p.m. as he approached his vehicle, which was parked at a sprawling estate east of Nairobi, the police said. Eyewitnesses said the robbers shot Ndegwa in the chest after he resisted their attempts to snatch his car keys.
