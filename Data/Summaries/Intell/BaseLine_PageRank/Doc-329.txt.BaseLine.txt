To be fair, so far as truth can be discerned from polls, the free Western world is indeed grateful, and on balance quite supportive of the cause the Americans are leading. Perhaps the best evidence of this is the huge demand for U.S. visas -- especially in places such as the West Bank and Gaza. Action is more eloquent than words, and the real attitudes of people are often revealed in what they take for granted. The many thousand generously funded U.S. universities are magnets for young literates from every culture. Often enough, the radicals who spout anti-American doctrines imbibed them amidst the safety and leisure of U.S. campus life. And in their confusion of ends and means, they make free use of technology and media largely developed in that America. The world's most prominent self-styled Palestinian refugee, Edward Said, is the perfect example of this: a man who would be nothing without the chic and prestige conferred by elite U.S. universities and the publishing institutions of New York, N.Y. In the column I wrote on the very day of the September catastrophe, I touched upon the envy of America, which I believed to be its root cause. In the words of one, I can't believe anyone would sacrifice themselves and many others over something as petty as envy. Almost five months later, I feel more certain that my analysis was essentially right: We must look to moral rather than political causes to understand this natural antipathy that so much of the planet shares. And even in the first hours after the catastrophe, CBC was unselfconsciously airing a procession of guests making liberal use of the but construction. For while the left has compounded anti-Americanism into dogma, the right in Canada, Europe and beyond, participates in the envy of U.S. success. From British lords down to humble skinheads, sneering at the American vulgarity confers a comforting sense of personal and national vindication, when no other prop can be found.
