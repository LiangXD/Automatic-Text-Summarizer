Dear , A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill's help. Here's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely source: Goodwill's controller, Juli. She tells me that the 3,666 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $49 million dollars. Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities. Remember what she said in my last letter? Sherry learned through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the welfare system and support her family. He trained in desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with new-found skills in a burgeoning industry. I wanted to be there...I had my second chance to change my life. Sincerely, William A Carter, Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation P.S. Your gift is a wise investment in the community.
