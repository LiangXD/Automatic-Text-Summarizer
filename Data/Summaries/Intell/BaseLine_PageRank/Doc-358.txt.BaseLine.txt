Ministry Criticizes 'Odious' U.S. Report The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it was surprised, to put it mildly by the U.S. State Department's criticism of Russia's human rights record and objected in particular to the odious section on Chechnya. One gets the impression that its writers simply used old drafts, as if nothing had happened in either Russia or the United States in recent years, as if the events of Sept. The State Department's annual human rights report, which was published Monday, said Russia had a poor record regarding the independence and freedom of the media and in Chechnya. U.S. officials have partially endorsed that view, pointing to rebel leaders such as Shamil Basayev and the Jordanian-born Omar Ibn al Khattab, who are believed to have financial and other ties to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist network.
