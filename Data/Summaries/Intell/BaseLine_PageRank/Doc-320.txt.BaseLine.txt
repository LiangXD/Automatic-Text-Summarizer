Russian Yuri Onufrienko couldn't wait to take over as space station commander from American Frank Culbertson. The cosmonaut kept peeking through a small window before the hatch finally swung open between the docked spacecraft.

The carrier, named Raffaello, is loaded with three tons of food, clothes, science experiments and spare parts.
