His remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar after Northern Alliance troops finally entered Kunduz. SAS [Special Air Service] soldiers and their American counterparts are fighting alongside the Alliance as they have swept across large swathes Afghanistan. British troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was better than anybody could have hoped for , according to Mr Cook. We will continue obviously to keep the situation under review, but frankly, I think we should welcome the fact that their presence has not been needed in Afghanistan. The city's top Taliban commander was among thousands of Afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold following the rapid collapse of their regime across the majority of the country. So although our international staff went back to Kabul and hope to go back to the other places... one cannot say it is safe in the country and secure enough. His concerns echoed those voiced by leading charity Oxfam, which said instability across the country was hampering aid efforts. He again stressed that Britain would need to see evidence before it became involved in military action in other countries.
