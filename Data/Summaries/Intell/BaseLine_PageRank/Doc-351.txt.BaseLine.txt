LONDON: British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Tuesday there was already pretty strong early evidence that President Robert Mugabe had stolen the election in Zimbabwe. This is a terrible period, not only for Zimbabwe but for those who hold the course of democracy dear in Africa and elsewhere. Counting in the election, in which Mugabe is battling for his political future against opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai after 22 years in power, began Tuesday amid complaints in Zimbabwe over the conduct of the vote.
