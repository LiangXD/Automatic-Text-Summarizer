An official source who described the reaction on Tuesday said the criticism was an annual event and emphasized that it was not directed at human rights in Lebanon only, but covered several other countries in as well. The source said that the ministry would soon deliver copies of the report to the various ministries concerned, especially the Interior and Municipalities Ministry, prior to relaying its observations to the State Department in Washington. The report's reference to intelligence agents' monitoring the activities of opposition politicians and tapping the phones of certain government leaders is a serious matter and harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country, the source added. On the other hand, the report praised the role played by the Lebanese press, describing it as containing daily criticism of the government and its practices.
