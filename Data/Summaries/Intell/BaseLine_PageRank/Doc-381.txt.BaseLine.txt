Zimbabwe's rigged election The election this week in Zimbabwe was an ugly travesty from which all of southern Africa will suffer. Voters lined up for hours at polling stations, many of them in vain. International observers called the process deeply flawed, and the Bush administration has refused to recognize the declared results. By failing to hold firm they not only damage their diplomatic credibility, but also ignore the consequences for nearby African states of Mugabe's misrule. Washington and other Western governments may now strengthen the current mild sanctions against Zimbabwe. These steps would be far more effective if they were joined by major African states.
