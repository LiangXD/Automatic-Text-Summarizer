It was only natural for US National Security Adviser condoleezza Rice to make statements yesterday after what can be described as a oneupmanship of rudeness was inaugurated in Washington last week. The legislative branch took part in this oneupmanship by issuing resolutions showing full allegiance to the radical right wing in Israel. If Rabbi Kahana were alive, he would have been regarded as a moderate person, compared to the US legislative branch. They served as a crude example of the arrogance of power and attempts to control nations' resources, dictate policies, and impose leaders through pressure and coercion. Rice attacks the Palestinian leadership, which was democratically elected, as testified by international observers, including former US presidents. A prominent Israeli official, Shim'on Peres, said when his army moved into the Janin refugee camp: I am afraid that a massacre may have been committed in the Janin camp. These accords explicitly stipulated that Israeli forces must not enter the Palestinian-controlled areas, which are called Areas A and cover all the Palestinian cities, naturally including Ramallah. For its part, the Palestinian leadership has always sought a just peace, not submission to plans aimed at writing off the Palestinian issue and swallowing the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The United States turns a blind eye to these practices, pretending to forget that they violate human rights and are continuously denounced by the international community.
