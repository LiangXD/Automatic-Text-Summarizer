GABORONE Sept 17 Sapa SADC, USAID SIGN DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS Executive secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Prega Ramsamy and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on Monday signed dollar-based agreements to up American aid to SADC in three areas. The three programmes are virtually open ended, being topped up as projects finish and others are initiated. Replying, Lange said: The day September 11, 2001 has become one of the worst days in American history. We are grateful for the strong support expressed by the international community, particularly the SADC member states. We strongly condemn this ghastly and barbaric act of terrorism and wanton destruction of property and the loss of innocent lives.
