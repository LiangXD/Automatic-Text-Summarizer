US President George W. Bush presented 14 February his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which is designed to slow down global warming. The White House hastened to describe the Bush plan as the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions. Carl Pope, the director of the Sierra Club, one of the major US environmental protection associations, does not mince his words when describing the US plan to replace the Kyoto Protocol. Contrary to the preceding one, the plan proposed by Washington Thursday thus no longer has any binding procedure and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives. It advocates a voluntarist approach to the fight against global warming by directly linking the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction to US economic growth. To encourage industry and consumers to demonstrate environmental public spiritedness Mr. Bush proposes tax incentives of $4.6 billion for the adoption of renewable sources of energy. Mr. Bush did, nevertheless, affirm that the United States will not interfere with the countries opting for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. President George W. Bush considered, moreover, that it would be irresponsible not to ask India and China to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Philip Clapp, president of the National Environment Trust, sums up well the general thrust of the reaction of environmental movements: There is no reason at all to believe that the polluters are suddenly going to become reasonable.
