Two Russian Cosmonauts To Conduct Space Walk Two Russian cosmonauts, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, are expected to perform a space walk on the International Space Station (ISS) at about 04:00 PM Moscow time. Frank Culbertson, an American astronaut and the commander of Expedition 3 to the ISS, will survey and control their actions from aboard the station. This information was unfolded by the Russian Mission Control. The space walk period will decrease if they successfully remove the object located in the gap between the ship and the docking unit. Experts believe that the shuttle will be unable to dock the ISS if the Russian cargo ship is not tightly secured to the station. Otherwise, the dynamic blow of the docking shuttle may set the Russian ship swaying which might damage the ISS.
