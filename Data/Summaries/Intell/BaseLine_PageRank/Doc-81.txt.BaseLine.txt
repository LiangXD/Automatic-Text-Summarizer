USA : Sale of U.S. power agencies would be complex $- GAO. WASHINGTON 1997-03-31 Selling off federal hydropower plants and power marketing agencies would be very complex and would likely affect electricity prices in some areas , according_to a Congressional report released Monday. The General Accounting Office report surveyed all the interests that the government would need to address if it chose to sell the Southeastern , Southwestern and Western Area Power Marketing Administrations. However , the report did not weigh the costs and benefits of a sale , a hot issue for lawmakers looking to balance the budget and for companies pushing for open power markets. Charles Norwood , a Georgia Republican , last week urged House Republican leaders to reject any plans to sell the power agencies , saying the fiscal benefits were questionable.
