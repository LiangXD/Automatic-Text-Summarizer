15 Stretching The Case For Inhumanity Terrorist thugs at Gitmo don't deserve their treatment By Vito Fossella Having had the opportunity to tour Camp X-Ray last week, I offer America's critics a simple piece of advice: Get a life. They have absurdly criticized as inhumane the decision to temporarily place prison suits, handcuffs and blindfolds on the terrorists during transfer to protect the military personnel guarding them. They have even demanded upgraded accommodations, seemingly forgetting that these are the leaders of a worldwide terrorist organization who have repeatedly vowed to kill innocent Americans through war or terror. They enjoy their own large cell, talking freely with one another, worshiping with a prayer leader, and writing home. They have been away from home for months, and they serve our nation with dignity and honor. Indeed, since their arrival at Camp-X-Ray, some of the terrorists have openly threatened the Marines who guard them and talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing the American people. Already, intelligence gathered from other al Qaeda detainees has uncovered potential plots to attack American embassies, nuclear power plants and public water facilities. Instead of lecturing the United States, our critics may better spend their time reminding others that if terrorists don't want to be detained at Camp X-Ray, they should join the civilized world.
