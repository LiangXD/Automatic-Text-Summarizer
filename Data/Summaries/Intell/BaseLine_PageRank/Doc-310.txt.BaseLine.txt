The Namibians went as far as to say Zimbabwe's election system was water tight, without room for rigging. President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya congratulated Mugabe, calling his victory testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of Zimbabwe hold in you. The observations of the 14-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) Parliamentary Forum team differed considerably from the other African missions. In sharp contrast to other African observer teams, the forum said the conduct of the elections fell short of regional expectations. The SADC parliamentarians' view was also echoed by the Norwegian observer delegation which said, on Tuesday, that the election failed to meet international standards. Norway Prime Minister Jan Petersen said in a statement that The presidential election in Zimbabwe has not satisfied the fundamental requirements for a democratic election. Mugabe's main challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change, has rejected the outcome of the presidential poll. Western governments are lining up to condemn the Mugabe government, while the African bloc appears to have opted for solidarity in support of Mugabe. U.S. President George Bush added his voice on Wednesday night, categorically rejecting Zimbabwe's presidential poll. We are dealing with our friends to figure out how to deal with this flawed election. Bush's secretary of state, Colin Powell, earlier concluded: Mr Mugabe may claim victory, but not democratic legitimacy. The European Union and the United States have already imposed 'smart', selected sanctions on Mugabe and 19 people in his inner circle. But the Zimbabwean leader has been silent since his final campaign rally last Friday, though people are eagerly awaiting his victory speech.
