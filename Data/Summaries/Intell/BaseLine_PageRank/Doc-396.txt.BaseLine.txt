The criteria set by Rice are the following: the three countries in question are repressive and grave human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. By all conservative estimates, there are scores of other countries which can easily qualify as repressive and violating human rights.

As for her wording regarding acquisition of weapons, what is particularly noteworthy is the use of the words aggressively seeking nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. In other words, countries which are seeking or developing such arsenal at a slow pace do not seem to come within the scope of the axis of evil. One can name more than a dozen countries which are contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one speed or another.
