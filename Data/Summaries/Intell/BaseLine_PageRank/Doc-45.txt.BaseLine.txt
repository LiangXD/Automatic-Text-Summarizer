JAKARTA 1997-03-31 Net profits posted by Indocement , a major Indonesian cement manufacturer , in 1996 are above market estimates and installation of additional production capacity in 1997 and 1998 should keep the company in good stead , analysts said. However , Partono said the company had instituted changes in its accounting system in 1996 which partially accounted for the above-expectation earnings. Aside_from changes in the accounting method , he also said the stable growth of the company's food division at about 15 percent per year had contributed to earnings growth. Partono said he expected Indocement's cement division to imrove its performance in 1997 and 1998 due_to additional capacity from two new plants in West Java and Kalimantan. He added that currently it trades at a price earnings of 9.1 times its 1997 earnings compared with Semen Gresik which trades at 12 times 1997 earnings. _ So , its cement business appears to be undervalued relative to other cement companies.
