The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has been strongly criticized and condemned by many countries. Though the report has been made public for 10 days, its contents, which are inaccurate and lacking good will, continue to be commented on by the world media. The report quoting data from the Christian Science Monitor, points out that the murder rate in the United States is 5.5 per 100,000 people. Many people have been sentenced to death for crime they did not commit as a result of an unjust legal system. The British News Agency Reuters remarked that in the 2000 human rights report, the United States criticized Egypt for trying suspected terrorists in military courts. In light of the United States' malicious goals, its Annual Human Rights Report for 2001 is facing strong protest and criticism from the world. Many Americans have given evidence to prove the wrong judgment of their administration against human rights in other countries, especially in Vietnam.
