About 50 members of various Japanese and U.S. nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) opposed to the U.S. alternative to the 1997 pact gathered around 1 p.m. at Tameike-Sanno Station, close to the embassy in Tokyo's Minato Ward. It is very regrettable that the United States has taken a negative stand, Masaaki Nakajima of Friends of the Earth (FoE) Japan said. Protesters carried banners reading, Ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol. The demonstration came amid heightened security around the embassy as well as elsewhere in Tokyo for the president's visit. In the letter, the NGOs said, We, Japanese environmental NGOs concerned about climate change, were terribly dismayed by your new climate change plan. On Thursday, Bush unveiled the new plan that calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies in accordance with economic growth instead of mandatory reduction targets.
