The oat-bran craze has cost the world's largest cereal maker market share. And now Kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $1 billion cereal plant. Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%. Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg. Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to Kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats, says Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire. I don't think Kellogg can get back to 40% this year, he said. People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that's 'healthy' for you -- oats, bran. In announcing the plant delay, Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe said, Cereal volume growth in the U.S. has not met our expectations for 1989. General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity. Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged from $1 billion to $1.2 billion. But in recent weeks, construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site. Fluor Daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew, the sources said. Although he called current market conditions highly competitive, Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year. Net fell 16% to $123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share.
