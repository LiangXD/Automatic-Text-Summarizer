SHANGHAI, Oct 16 (AFP) - Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar warned Tuesday that prolonged military attacks on Afghanistan could destabilise the Islamic world and reiterated calls for the US to end the campaign quickly. We hope it can be ended as soon as possible, Syed Hamid told AFP in an interview here ahead of a ministerial gathering of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. One cannot be too philosophical or idealistic about civil liberties when they can jeopardise peace and security, law and order in a country. Opposition groups in Malaysia have expressed concern that the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is using the US-led war on terror as a pretext to crack down on legitimate dissent. Mahathir will be among APEC leaders, including US President George W. Bush, convening in Shanghai this weekend for an annual summit. The declaration was necessary because terrorism was the most dangerous enemy of law-abiding citizens and an affront against law and democracy , Syed Hamid said.
