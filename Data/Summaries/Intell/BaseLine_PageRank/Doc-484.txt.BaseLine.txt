China has launched three unmanned spacecraft consecutively and exhibited to the world the capsules recovered. It can carry two to three astronauts and continue to cruise in space for more than 20 days. Its interior is equipped with corresponding facilities for space observation and space drug and microgravity tests. Instrument panel, control shaft, and optical telescope will be installed below the seats. At the rear of the spaceship is the propulsion capsule to provide thrust to the spaceship in orbital control and return to earth. Space technology will not only be used for civilian, but also for military purposes, and there is no exception for China. The solar energy batteries usually cannot meet the needs of numerous equipment on a spaceship. However, it is understood that China has successfully resolved this problem to provide sufficient power supply for its spaceship. To facilitate recovery and rescue in future manned spaceflight, the recovery site will be located in sparsely populated grassland or the wilderness. An informed source has said that it can be seen that the designs for China's manned spaceflight have taken into consideration future modifications.
