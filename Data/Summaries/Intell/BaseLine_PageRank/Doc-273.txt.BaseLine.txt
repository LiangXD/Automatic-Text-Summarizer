Courtaulds PLC announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value. The British chemical and textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create a new, listed U.K. stock with a probable market capitalization between #300 million ($473 million) and #400 million, analysts said. The establishment of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as early as next year's first quarter. The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of #50 million on #980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31. The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders, customers and employees.
