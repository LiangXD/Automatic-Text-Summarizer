The rail car is part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, the centerpiece of what is to be a 120-metre girder running the length of the space station. The completed girder will support thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for use throughout the station. NASA said the Mobile Transporter, as the rail car is officially known, was ready for its first test today. Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, said Canadarm2 has so far performed flawlessly in its pivotal role installing the truss segment. Teams of engineers from the CSA and MD Robotics, the Brampton-based company that built the arm, were monitoring its work closely from the ground. An anomaly was detected on one of its joints several weeks ago, but the Canadian engineers successfully bypassed the problem area. The 18-metre arm, which is powerful enough to lift entire station modules, was also rewired so it could draw power through the S-0 truss.
