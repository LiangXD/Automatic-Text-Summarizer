The move, which follows the European Union's rejection of Israel's military occupation of the Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, was the subject of European debate and Israeli objection in the past. It also signals the EU's discontent over Israel's refusal to provide it with a list of the Israeli factories operating in the Occupied Palestinian and Arab Territories. In November of last year, the EU had issued a warning to European importers, specifying that Israeli exports originating in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as well as the Golan Heights were not included in the free trade agreement with Israel.
