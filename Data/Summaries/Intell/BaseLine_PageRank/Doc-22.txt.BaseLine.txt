BRAZIL : SOCCER-BOTAFOGO BEAT THE RULES TO REACH FINAL. Brian Homewood RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-03-30 Botafogo won the first stage of the Rio de Janeiro championship on Sunday after a match in which the bizarre rules of the competition , rather_than rivals Vasco da Gama , appeared to be their real opponents. Goalkeeper Vagner commented : _ After eleven straight wins , we still had to play Vasco but I think God was watching us. _ Winning the first stage guarantees Botafogo a place in the final of the tournament , where they will join the winners of the next two stages. Curiously , the next two stages will be decided on points , with no final being played. Botafogo were among three clubs who boycotted the opening day of play because they did not like the rules at the time. Meanwhile , several games have been marred by brawls on the pitch which have needed police intervention. On Wednesday , Botafogo , already guaranteed their place in the fianl , caused a furore when they fielded a reserve team against Flamengo , who needed to beat them to overtake Vasco and finish second.
