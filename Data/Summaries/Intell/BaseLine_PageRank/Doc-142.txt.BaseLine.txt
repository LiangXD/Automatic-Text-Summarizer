Large numbers of People's Liberation Army troops have also been seen on the move in the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang, to the far west of China, they said. Public sentencing rallies have been going on in many counties around Kashgar, the official, who identified himself only as Yakefu, told AFP. He also said increasing troop movements had been seen at night around Kashgar, but was unsure where they were going or what their orders were. Diplomat Arthur Marquardt arrived in Kashgar on Saturday and left Wednesday for the provincial capital of Urumqi, said Dong Jianhua at the Kashgar foreign affairs bureau. They were talking about China's 'development of the West' program, China's policies on minority nationalities, our opinions on the September 11 attack and the Taliban forces, she said. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday China would take all necessary measures to ensure the stability of its border regions ahead of any US retaliatory strikes.
