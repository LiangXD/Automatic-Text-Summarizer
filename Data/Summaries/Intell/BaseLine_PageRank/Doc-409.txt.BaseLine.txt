November 15, 1994 Dear , Think of your greatest accomplishments. Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job. For several years he performed packaging and clerical work. His most recent job lasted only a year before cut-backs eliminated his position. For 18 long months Michael could not find a job. He resorted to public assistance dollars to survive. After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person for the job. They face some barrier to employment and they want to work. And then the pay-off begins for the entire community. Sincerely, James M. McClelland President P.S. Your gift will make a difference.
