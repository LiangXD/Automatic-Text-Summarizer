NEW YORK 1997-03-31 Coram Healthcare Corp stock fell Monday after the company said its merger partner Integrated Health Services Inc lowered the amount it will pay for Coram , traders said. In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade , Coram shares were off 3.12 percent , or 1/8 , to 3-7/8 in above-average trading volume , while Integrated shares gained 0.9 percent , or 1/4 , to 29-1/4. When the merger was first announced last October , it said Coram holders would get about $5.50 worth of Integrated stock for each Coram share under the previous , fixed ratio. Coram has been given more certainty of the merger closing by virtue of the $25 million breakup fee _ contained in the new terms that go into effect this Friday. Joel Ray , analyst at Wheat First Butcher Singer , said _ The stated reason ( for the change in the terms ) is the weakness in the sector in general. The same amount of debt is being assumed. _ _ We have been recommending Integrated Health , _ Ray said. _ The transaction makes a_lot_of sense for the intermediate $- and long-run.
