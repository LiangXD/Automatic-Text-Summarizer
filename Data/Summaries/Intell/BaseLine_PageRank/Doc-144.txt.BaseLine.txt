TAIPEI, Sept 26 (AFP) -- Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday reiterated Taipei's full support for the United States as Washington prepared to launch reprisals against Afghanistan. Chen's remarks came as the US was massing forces to launch reprisals against Afghanistan, where the prime suspect Usama bin Laden is believed to be in hiding. Since his inauguration last year, Bush has backpedalled from his predecessor Bill Clinton's policy of engagement with China.
