Sandra Harwitt KEY BISCAYNE , Florida 1997-03-31 She_ 's fresh-faced and formidable and now rules the world of women's tennis. At age 16 , Martina Hingis of Switzerland has swept aside her last 26 opponents on the fast track to becoming the youngest player ever to grab the top ranking in the world. The latest player to fall to the Hingis combination of speed and tennis smarts was Monica Seles in the final of the Lipton Championships. If she_ 's not able to , somebody_else is going to step there. _ Hingis takes time from the rigours of competition to blow off steam. An avid horsewoman , Hingis travels with _ my boots and pants _ in hopes of a joyous ride. For me , it_ 's important to do something_else. _ The trip to the top has been a wonderful ride.
