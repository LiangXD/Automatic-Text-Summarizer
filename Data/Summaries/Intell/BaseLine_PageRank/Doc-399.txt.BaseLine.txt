The fledgling MDC won 57 of 120 elected seats in June 2000 parliamentary elections as Mugabe's popularity plunged amid economic devastation and chaos. Security forces tortured opponents, ruling party militants abducted people, and police arrested opposition supporters who were themselves the victims of crimes. Freedom of the press and freedom of assembly were also severely restricted, the report said. Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand demanded the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth to protest state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses against the opposition. Tendai Biti, the MDC's foreign affairs spokesman, said Mugabe was trying to hide his policies of violence and intimidation behind his rift with Britain. African leaders closed ranks at the Commonwealth summit out of fear for their own power, he said. The problems of human rights and good governance are mirrored in their countries, Biti said. Foreign diplomats based in Harare said Monday police prevented them from finishing a meeting on Monday with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Tsvangirai called the meeting to discuss food shortages gripping Zimbabwe and measures his party was considering to combat them, diplomats said. State radio also reported Monday that three opposition lawmakers tried to bribe Zimbabwe's air force commander to help calm security forces if Mugabe were removed.
