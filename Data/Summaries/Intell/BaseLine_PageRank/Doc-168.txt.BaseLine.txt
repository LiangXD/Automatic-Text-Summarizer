Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is higher than any time in the past several hundred thousand years. He also warned that an abrupt climate change might take place when a critical value of temperature rise is exceeded. In certain regions, the temperature may rise suddenly and sharply. This disaster can only be averted if we all join in to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to stop global warming. In March, the new Bush Administration openly declared it would rescind its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. Its excuses include that it will harm the US economy and there is insufficient participation by developing nations. Dr. Ren was critical of this irresponsible decision by the US Government. He indicated that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is accumulated over the past 100-200 years. Furthermore, on a per capita basis, emissions by developing nations are also far less than that by industrialized nations. It mainly requires the joint effort of industrialized nations to resolve global warming. However, to protect their own interests, a few industrialized nations repeatedly made outrageous demands in past UNFCCC conferences. In the Bonn conference in July, Japan even made new demands regarding the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. During this conference, countries such as Japan, Russia, Australia, and Canada played the same tactic again to try to delay the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. In order to implement the treaty as soon as possible, developing nations and the EU agreed to a compromise. As a reminder, Dr. Ren pointed out: The Kyoto Protocol is merely a gesture for mankind to stop global warming. Dr. Ren suggested that developing nations should also join forces in emissions reduction in the future.
