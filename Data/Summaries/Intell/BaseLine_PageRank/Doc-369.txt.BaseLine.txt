Finance Minister of Argentina Resigns Post The uncertainty of Argentina's precarious financial situation deepened yesterday when Daniel Marx, the finance secretary, resigned. Mr. Marx stepped down as Argentina paid $700 million in short-term debt owed to local banks by forcing pension funds to buy government bonds. Argentina has been struggling to contain its public debt, now totaling about $132 billion, after four years of recession. Domestic creditors already agreed, under some duress, to swap roughly $40 billion in obligations for new loans. The International Monetary Fund decided last week to delay the release of $1.3 billion in aid, which is needed to cover a budget shortfall. During the last few months, political infighting has eroded the government's ability to adhere to the zero-deficit rule favored by the I.M.F. and promised by Mr. Cavallo. The strikers were protesting federal budget cuts and restrictions on withdrawals from bank accounts. A sudden, widespread drop in deposits threatened to choke economic activity and worsen the country's financial troubles. They were indicative of the very difficult situation that the country was in and continues to be in, he said. His technical knowledge and strong relations with Argentina's foreign creditors won him considerable respect at home and abroad. On Thursday, Argentina's president, Fernando de la Rua met with Carlos Sa?nem, a former president and leader of the Justicialists, to discuss economic strategy.
