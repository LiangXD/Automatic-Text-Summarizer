He said navy gunboats and helicopter gunships repulsed the initial attack and first reports indicated at least two rebel craft had been blown out of the water. Fighting continued two hours after the initial exchange of fire in high seas and the navy had called in more gun ships to beat back the guerrillas, Karunaratne said. The ship had been about 26 miles (42 kilometres) away from Point Pedro when the attack started, Karunaratne said. Hours before the ferry incident, a navy fast attack craft encountered an explosive-laden boat which blew up in an apparent Tamil Tiger suicide mission, Karunaratne said. All three people onboard that boat evaporated, indicating that it was packed with explosives to ram against the navy fast attack craft, Karunaratne said. An explosives-laden boat rammed into the bulk cargo carrier, MV Mercs Uhana, as it approached the Jaffna peninsula carrying food and other essentials to the embattled region. Twenty-one crewmen were rescued, but another seven went missing after the attack. Merchant vessels have been warned to operate several miles off the coast to prevent being detected by rebels along the northeastern seaboard.
