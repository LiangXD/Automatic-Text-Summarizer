Ritsuko Shimizu TOKYO 1997-03-31 Japan announced a range of measures on Monday to try to jump start its long-stalled real estate market , a move analysts called a good first step but hardly the final answer to the problem. Forming the backbone of the package was the easing of rules that would allow real estate held as collateral to be turned into securities to be sold to investors. Huge , unrealised losses in real estate are seen by many analysts as being at the core of Japan's financial traumas. The changes are aimed at helping banks , property holders and others accept those losses so they can begin growing again. The measures are seen as vital if Japan's banks are to one day rid themselves of their mountain of bad loans. Many of the bad loans were made in the 1980s _ bubble era _ of sky-high stock and land prices to the real estate sector , with property used as collateral.
