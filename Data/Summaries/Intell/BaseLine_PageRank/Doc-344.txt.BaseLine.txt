Speaking publicly for the first time since government election officials declared him the winner four days ago, Mugabe returned to the themes he struck during his campaign against Morgan Tsvangirai, a former trade union leader. Several African heads of states attended the ceremony, including President Sam Nujoma of Namibia and President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo. But the 57 lawmakers from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change boycotted it, as did representatives from the United States, European Union countries, New Zealand and Canada. Mugabe, 78, remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program, under which the country's most fertile land has been seized from white commercial farmers for redistribution to poor, landless blacks. "It is our people who decide, who must say so, not you, sirs and not the one person in 10 Downing St., Tony Blair," Mugabe said, referring to Britain's prime minister.
