The Nippon Foundation revealed that the number of pirates in Southeast Asia attacking ships for ransom is on rise. However, the foundation warned that the number of pirate attacks, in the new form of sea jacking ships for ransom, has been increasing. In addition, an Indonesian-registered ship was attacked and the crews from two ships, including a captain, were kidnapped and held for ransom. Yoshihiko Yamada, domestic division chief of Nippon Foundation's Department of Marine Affairs said, There were very few piracy attacks for ransom on commercial vessels.
