The United States dismisses such concerns: it's a prison, after all; remember the Black Hole of Mazar-iSharif. Their prayers are now led by a victorious enemy soldier - what could be worse? As for likenesses, the Buddha said on his deathbed: All composite things arise and decline. Besides, those statues had been defaced long before they were finally reduced to rubble. One of them had lost not just its face but its entire head. But the Taliban commander who aimed that RPG was certainly ascribing human characteristics to a lump of stone. Which was most disturbing of all, because such was the very sin that rocket was supposedly intended to expunge. So those poor bullet-scarred statues made everyone look sad and foolish, and their final immolation a year ago put them out of their misery, so to speak. The veil of compassion was hardly elastic enough to pull over those two great big holes in the earth.
