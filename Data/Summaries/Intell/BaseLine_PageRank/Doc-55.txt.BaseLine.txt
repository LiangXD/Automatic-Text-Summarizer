BRUSSELS, June 29 (AFP) -- Nearly 100 donor countries and international organizations opened their checkbooks here Friday to bail out struggling Yugoslavia after Slobodan Milosevic's lightning transfer to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The donors' conference, co-sponsored by the European Commission and the World Bank, was hoping to raise 1.25 billion dollars (1.47 billion euros) for Yugoslavia this year for urgent repairs to infrastructure and salaries to teachers and other civil servants. The European Commission anounced it had pledged a financial package of grants and loans totalling 530 million euros (450 million dollars). Labus said the United States, which had until the last minute been uncertain of attending the conference, contingent on Milosevic's extradition, pledged 181.6 million dollars during the morning session. Japanese Ambassador to the EU Takayuki Kimura said his country had pledged 50 million dollars, in addition to technical assistance and another 10 million dollars to the whole of southeast Europe, most of it to Yugoslavia. We are now fully back into the international community, politically, diplomatically and financially, and that's very important for us. Infrastructure, including power, water, rail and roads, he said, were suffering from many years of decay, mismanagement and the consequences of the NATO 1999 bombing campaign that ended Belgrade's repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. In Berlin, Bodo Hombach, coordinator of the Balkans Stability Pact, said several delegations to the Brussels conference told him it was now easier and more motivating to supply Belgrade with the aid it desperately needs.
