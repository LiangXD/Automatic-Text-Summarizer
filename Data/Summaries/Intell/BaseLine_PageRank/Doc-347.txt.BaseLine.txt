BEIJING: China on Thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the United States and Taiwan, demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to US weapons sales. Zhang further expressed alarm over Washington's announcement on Wednesday that defense department officials will soon visit Taiwan to discuss the sale of eight diesel electric submarines. China has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the United States and Taiwan, Zhang said. She refused to confirm an April 26 to May 3 visit by Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao to Washington, as reported in the Hong Kong press. The visit, if Beijing allows it, is widely expected to be centered on China's dissatisfaction over the Taiwan issue. Beijing has also long refused to establish diplomatic relations with any nation that maintains official contact with Taiwan, although it has encouraged economic exchanges between Taiwan and all nations. Wolfowitz expressed concern about China's continuing deployment of forces and tactical missiles to areas across the straits from Taiwan.
