He did not make any concessions, even after his meetings with the Chinese leaders in Beijing, said Cheng Tuan-yao, research fellow at the Institute of International Relations in National Chengchi University. While past trips to China by US presidents have produced agreements or statements that have damaged Taiwan's interests, Bush's visit only enhanced the nation's confidence in his administration, Cheng said. Notably, he didn't restate the so-called 'three nos' policy, said DPP legislator Parris Chang (Chang Hsu-ch'eng) of Bush's remarks on Taiwan during his two-day trip to Beijing that concluded yesterday afternoon. The three nos include no support for an independent Taiwan; no recognition of two Chinas" or one China and a separate Taiwan; and no support for Taiwan's entry into international organizations that require members to be states. Of course he would not use the term of 'peaceful reunification'... because the American position is that relations between Taiwan and China should be open-ended, Chang said. China's Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, in a speech in Washington earlier this month, urged the US to support peaceful unification. Although he did not mention Taiwan directly, the implication of this remark seemed to be that Taiwan was not to be excluded, Cheng said. The US' rising concerns over China's military expansion and its appreciation for Taipei's support for the US-led war against terrorism drove Bush to stand firm in his support for Taiwan, the DPP legislator said. These two reports seemed to indicate that the Bush administration took China's rising military threat more seriously than did the Clinton's administration.
