Chavez, 47, presented his resignation to the military after top commanders confronted him at the presidential palace. He quit just hours after at least 13 people were killed and a reported 110 wounded during a demonstration by an estimated 150,000 opposition supporters in downtown Caracas. Military officers said Chavez had ordered National Guard troops and civilian gunmen, including rooftop snipers, to stop the marchers from reaching the palace. His one-time 80 per cent popularity ratings plunged to below 30 per cent this year. He accused business leaders of conspiring with major labour groups, the news media and the Roman Catholic hierarchy to overthrow him. Many also resented Chavez's alleged ties with leftist Colombian guerrillas and with Fidel Castro's Cuba. Oil markets have been concerned over supply after Iraq's decision this week to suspend exports to Israeli allies. In London, Brent crude oil opened 44 cents down from Thursday at $24.60 US a barrel. In New York, May contracts of light sweet U.S. crude fell 46 cents a barrel to $24.53 US. In downtown Caracas, streets were littered with debris - and in some places, stained with blood. Shops and businesses remained closed, and most people simply stayed home, stunned and wondering what would come next. Thousands of coup supporters celebrated overnight, waving flags, blowing whistles and jamming a main highway in Caracas. Police warned that Chavez supporters reportedly were distributing weapons, especially in the hillside slums surrounding the capital. Domestic opponents claimed his government was secretly arming neighbourhood block committees known as Bolivarian Circles, named after South American liberator Simon Bolivar, to defend his revolution. The circles were created after Castro urged Chavez's supporters to organize during a 2000 visit. They closed another refinery, disrupted gasoline deliveries and all but stopped loading of oil tankers.
