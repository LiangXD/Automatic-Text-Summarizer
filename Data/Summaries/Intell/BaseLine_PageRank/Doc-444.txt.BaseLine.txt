I hope you'll consider continuing your support of Jameson's special campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx. I can tell you we need your help now as much as ever before. Many more camper referrals are coming from new organizations such as school social-workers and family counseling agencies. It seems summer options aren't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes, so we're doing all we can to make Jameson available. Sincerely, Julie Marsh Executive Director P.S. We know our follow-up weekends are going to be better attended than ever this fall and winter.
