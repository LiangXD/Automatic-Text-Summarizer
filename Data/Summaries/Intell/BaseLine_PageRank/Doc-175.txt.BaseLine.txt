MANILA, Nov 24 (AFP) - President Gloria Arroyo praised Malaysia on Saturday for the swift arrest of Muslim leader Nur Misuari, whose forces embarked on a fresh rebellion this week in the southern Philippines. Arroyo was very satisfied that the Malaysian government has been efficient enough to arrest him, her spokesman Rigoberto Tiglao told DZBB radio here. Tiglao separately told AFP that Manila would hold talks with Kuala Lumpur on the deportation of the former guerrilla leader turned politician. He suggested that Kuala Lumpur would have to take the initiative, saying that Misuari had apparently violated Malaysian law by entering the country without a passport. Misuari launched his revolt after Arroyo decided to back an MNLF rival in an election to be held Monday to choose the next ARMM governor. The government has deployed thousands of troops to Jolo to deter attempts by Misuari followers to disrupt the balloting. Lecaros, from the foreign ministry, said the arrest was a sign that the ASEAN, particularly Malaysia, is succeeding in the effort against terrorism. The Philippine government has information that Mr. Misuari has of late developed some links with the Abu Sayyaf about whom more need not be said, he said. Bernama quoted Malaysian police chief Norian Mai as saying police would try to hand Misuari and his men over to the Philippine government as soon as possible.
