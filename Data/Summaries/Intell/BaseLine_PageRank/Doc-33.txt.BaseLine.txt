Please believe ME , I '_ m ill ME sufferers are sick of doctors not taking them seriously and have made a cinema ad to win support for their case. WE ALL like to be taken seriously , especially when we are feeling ill. It is easy enough if you have chicken pox or some other common illness with well-defined physical symptoms. We have all heard stories about GPs alleged to have given patients short shrift with remarks like : & bquo ; Throw away your crutches. They cost money. & equo ; & bquo ; You are a menace to society ? a pest. It was not something you took to the doctor ? until Valium and Librium arrived on the market. Doctors are now increasingly reluctant to prescribe tranquillisers for fear of being sued by patients who become addicted to them. What this means is that good old_fashioned self-reliance could become a new health vogue of the Nineties. According_to one theory , held by some psychiatrists , patients may find doctors increasingly unsympathetic to their plight. Patients claiming to have Myalgic Encephalomyelitis ( ME ) may come into the latter category. Symptoms include fatigue , night sweats , weight loss and exhaustion. While some doctors recognise the condition , others question its existence , attributing problems to causes such as depression. Before and after ? new cinema commercial features a teenage sufferer whose life is totally disrupted by ME
