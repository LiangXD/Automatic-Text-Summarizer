George Bush has become an object for harsh criticism after his recent statement about the axis of evil. If Yasser Arafat is trying to do something to pacify the West, other Arab politicians and journalists are not afraid of saying something daring. The Egyptian governmental newspaper Al-Ahram wrote that Bush used the same language in his State of the Union speech that Osama bin Laden used in his video messages. The editor of the Al-Quds newspaper published in London Abd Al-Bari Atvan went further and compared George Bush with Hitler. The threats to Iran and Iraq were like Hitler's threats to Poland and Czech republic. Palestinian Alhayat Aljadeeda media outlets and the Voice of Palestine radio repeatedly called America the enemy of the Palestinian people after that axis of evil statement.
