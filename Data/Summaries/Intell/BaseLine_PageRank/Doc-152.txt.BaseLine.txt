That Angela Merkel, the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union, wanted the job had long been an open secret, although no one but she knew how far she was prepared to go. Mr. Stoiber seized it once the CDU made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman. That has always been the basic premise for a CSU chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party. It does not, of course, guarantee success at the polls -- or even solidarity in the campaign. Having marginalized their own leader, the CDU grandees cannot afford to leave the chancellor candidate in the lurch as well. The Union parties could not have wished for a better situation from which to launch their campaign.
