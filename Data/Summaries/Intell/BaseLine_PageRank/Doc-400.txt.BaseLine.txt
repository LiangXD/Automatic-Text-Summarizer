Amid widespread domestic criticism over curtailment of civil liberties, US officials laboured to convince a disbelieving press corps that the exercise was evenhanded. Excerpts from the briefing: Question: Just give us a couple examples what you're doing in Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Egypt. Assistant Secretary Craner: I'll throw out a few examples. Those are just two examples that are coming out of my office. Q: Lorne, I want to follow up on Saudi Arabia. Craner: Well, I would say two things. Number one, I disagree that it's the worst violator. Q: You didn't answer my question. Q: At what levels are we talking? I mean, there's nothing that's visible at all to us in the outside world. Q: But I heard this before. I'm asking specifically about one country. Craner: And I think I've outlined that. Can you point to any kind of tangible things? Q: Is that something we've talked to the Saudis about? We've been talking for years with the Saudis. Other administrations have talked about these issues. I hope you're gong to see more of an effect from this administration. You'll have to see how we do it differently. Q: Why can't you give us some indication? Craner: Because I don't yet know the effect in Saudi Arabia. Copyright @ 2001 Times Internet Limited.
