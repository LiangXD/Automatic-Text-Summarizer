John P. Hughes NEW YORK 1996-04-01 Nervous bond market participants on Tuesday morning await the release of the first of two critical reports on the U.S. economy for this week. The National Association of Purchasing Management's March survey was scheduled for release at 1000 EST/1500 GMT Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Reuters , on average , expected a reading of 53.6 , up from 53.1 in February. Such a reading would confirm that the manufacturing sector of the economy remained robust and heighten fears of continued strong U.S. economic growth. Market reaction to NAPM may be somewhat tempered by the more-watched nonfarm payrolls report looming on Friday. The Federal Reserve , when tightening last week , said it will respond in kind to strong economic growth going forward. That fueled speculation the Fed may be entering another tightening cycle and not just notching interest rates higher one time. With strong demand and low inventories it would be logical to expect a rebound in the manufacturing sector , Glassman said. Unless there_ 's some disaster about building inflation _ a strong NAPM could be shrugged off , he said.
