The new OpenScape UC Suite can now efficiently provide a single UC domain for organizations ranging from 100 to 500,000 users, enabling the highest level of productivity and collaboration for workers across the campus or around the world. Massively-scaled global UC deployments are now supported with up to 40,000 UC users per cluster and up to 500,000 UC users per system. As noted in a newly released Siemens Enterprise Communications sponsored State of Enterprise Communications 2012 global study, 80 percent of user end-points are now outside of corporate headquarters, further affirming the trend toward distributed and mobile workforces.
