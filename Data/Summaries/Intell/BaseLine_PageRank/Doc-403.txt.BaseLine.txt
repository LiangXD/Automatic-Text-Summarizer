Mugabe victory leaves West in tatters HARARE: Western countries were left frustrated and impotent after Robert Mugabe formally declared that he had overwhelmingly won Zimbabwe's presidential election. The extent to which Mugabe outmanoeuvred the west was made clear when southern African countries issued a surprise statement declaring the conduct of the election free and fair. At the weekend the European Union, prodded by Britain, is planning to extend the range of sanctions against Zimbabwe, targeting more members of the leadership. Earlier this year, the EU imposed a travel ban on Mugabe and 19 members of his regime and froze their overseas assets. But there were no illusions in Britain or elsewhere in Europe that the measures will have any real leverage in Harare. He said Mugabe had won 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,401 for challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). We find ourselves unable to endorse the purported election of President Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in this election. We need Tsvangirai to tell Mugabe he cannot steal this election, said Noel Gukuta, a youthful MDC voter. The soldiers have guns so we cannot fight him but we can make sure he cannot rule us. A senior state department official in Washington later said: We're considering further steps, given all the things that happened before and during the elections. Apart from the result, the main jolt yesterday was that election observers from South Africa, Nigeria and Namibia effectively endorsed the election.
