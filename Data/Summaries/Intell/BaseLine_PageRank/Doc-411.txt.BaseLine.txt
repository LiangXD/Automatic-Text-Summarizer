On his way home, he shares the story with four people at a street corner. Just like the respect we've earned from U.S. News & World Report. Just like the impact Goodwill's work has on our community. A real difference in people's lives -- in all of our lives. The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no time to waste.
