SAN FRANCISCO 1996-08-20 Levi Strauss & Co. said Tuesday it was launching a line of slacks meant to appeal to men who do_ n't like suits , in only the third major brand introduction in the company's 140-year history. The new slacks , to be called Slates , will be marketed as dressier than the company's famous jeans or its Dockers pants brand , but not as formal as suits. Those men want something different to wear as the workplace gets more casual , _ a new look for business and social occasions that falls between casual cotton pants and suits , _ Westfall said. The pants will come in flannel , wool gabardine and other fabrics with a suggested retail price of $50 to $90 a pair , said Lory Cogan , Levi vice president for marketing. A research study done last year for the company showed that 85 percent of American companies that had a traditional dress code were now allowing some form of more casual attire in the workplace.
