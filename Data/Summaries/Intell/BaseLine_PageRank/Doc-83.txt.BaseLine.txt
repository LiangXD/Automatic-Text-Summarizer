USA : US Treasuries end mixed as stocks slide sharply. Ellen Freilich NEW YORK 1997-03-31 U.S. Treasuries ended mixed on Monday as quarter-end portfolio adjustments and a steep slide in the stock market aided shorter-term securities , analysts said. Its yield finished at 7.10 percent , the highest since the 30-year bond yield ended at 7.11 percent on September 11 , 1996. In contrast , securities along the rest of the maturity curve edged higher , especially bills and shorter-term notes. Three-month bill rates fell four basis points to 5.19 percent. Six-month bill rates fell five basis points to 5.31 percent. Year bill rates fell two basis points to 5.67 pct. But the curve flattening trade could get undermined by the flight-to-quality dynamic created by the equity market , Dimick said.
