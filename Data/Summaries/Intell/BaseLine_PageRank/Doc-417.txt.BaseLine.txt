My name is Bonnie Rindner and I was born in San Antonio, TX, and the story I'm going to tell is about my mother. Her, let's see, her mother's family were wealthy people at one time. Uh, then the Depression came and apparently everyone lost all their money. And they were very poor by this point, and they had, I think, seven children. And how long have you lived in Charlotte?
