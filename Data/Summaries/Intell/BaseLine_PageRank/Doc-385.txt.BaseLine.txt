The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez Washington Times April 25, 2002 Pg. 18 The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez In Venezuela, the dust is finally settling after the dramatic turbulence of the past two weeks. But there are many grieving Venezuelans who aren't quite at peace. Their loved ones were gunned down, first by sympathizers of Mr. Chavez and subsequently by supporters of the short-lived interim government. Pedro Carmona, a powerful businessman, stepped into power on Friday but was forced to resign the next day. Following the coup, 40 persons, mostly Chavez supporters, were killed while protesting.

He has also alienated workers at his country's state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, by replacing long-serving professionals with his supporters.
