The prisoners, their hands and feet shackled and their heads covered by hoods, were loaded single file onto the plane at Kandahar Airport. Pentagon officials said some prisoners might also be sedated during the more-than-20-hour flight, but it was not clear whether that had happened. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that there was no evidence that the crash had been caused by hostile fire. Amnesty International issued a statement today saying that sedating prisoners or shackling them for an entire flight would violate international standards prohibiting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. About 20 minutes after the C-17 lifted off from the base at Kandahar Airport, marines came under small- arms fire near one of the runways. Military officials also said John Walker Lindh, the American who was captured with Taliban forces near Mazar-i-Sharif, was not among the prisoners transferred today. During the next few months, military work crews will build permanent facilities for as many as 2,000 prisoners. Mr. Rumsfeld declined to discuss details about the growing American involvement in the Philippines, where Abu Sayyaf guerrillas have been battling government troops in the southern island of Basilan. There's no question that we believe that if they could clear the Abu Sayyaf group out of Basilan Island, that would be a small blow against the extended Al Qaeda network, Mr. Wolfowitz said. In November, President Bush promised to give the Philippines a $100 million antiterrorism aid package that would include weapons, training and shared intelligence. Senior military officials have said they are increasingly concerned that there are other equally sophisticated and well-fortified underground complexes elsewhere in Afghanistan that could become guerrilla bases for remnants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. Today more than ever we also owe those in uniform the resources they need to maintain a very high state of readiness, Mr. Bush said.
