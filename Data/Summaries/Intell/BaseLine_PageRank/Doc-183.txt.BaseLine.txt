After coming to power, unilateralism and pragmatism have become Bush's main foreign policy line. Alternate use of and complementary nature of pragmatism and unilateralism constitute the characteristics of the Bush administration's diplomacy. Once coming to power, Bush insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System [NMD]. The international community and even US western allies, including US neighbor Canada, have consistently opposed the plan. He even claimed that to develop the NMD, the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM. The Sino-US plane collision event that occurred on 1 April can best illustrate the US alternate application of the two-isms in its diplomacy. The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that US crew members were detained by the Chinese side. Since coming to power, Bush, proceeding from the US immediate interests, has also adopted the pragmatism and unilateralism position with regard to international treaties. In July, the Bush administration decided to let the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty freeze in the Senate. The Bush administration either refuses to sign, ratify, or implement international treaties or asks for their revision. It does not want anything to do with the international treaties, mechanisms, and organizations that restrict or prevent US freedom. It does not want anything to do with countries and organizations that do not follow its orders or that always cause troubles to it. But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it.
