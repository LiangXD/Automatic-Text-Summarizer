December 1998 Your contribution to Goodwill will mean more than you may know. To help you see how much your contribution means, I'm sharing with you The words of people who have lived Goodwill's mission. We want you to Know why your support of Goodwill is so important. I was sad when I couldn't go to the snack bar to buy a soda. I can write my name on the deposit slip. I really like my job. -- Sherry Because people want to work. It didn't matter what the job was, I just wanted one. Their one common goal: they all want to work. Last year, Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their self-sufficiency. Right now, there are thousands of people who do not know what it feels like to support themselves. Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs. Use the enclosed card and give a generous gift to Goodwill today!
