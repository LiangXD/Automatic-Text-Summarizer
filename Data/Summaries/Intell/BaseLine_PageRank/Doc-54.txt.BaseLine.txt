Beijing has completed the afforestation of 4,000 hectares over the past six months, the municipal forestry bureau revealed yesterday. We planted trees mainly in the major five areas that are severely endangered by sandy wind, said Cai Baojun, an official with the bureau in charge of forest planting. By 2005, 50 per cent of Beijing's land, including both urban and rural areas, will have been covered with trees. Over the next 10 years, China will invest 6 billion yuan (US$720 million) to prevent sandstorms hitting Beijing, according to sources from the State Forestry Administration.
