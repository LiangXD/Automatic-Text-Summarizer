New Argentine president quits after a week; March vote nixed BUENOS AIRES - Argentina ended 2001 leaderless and penniless yesterday with its new interim president resigning a week into the job and the country fearing more bloodshed and the loss of savings frozen in the banks. Plunged into chaos by looting and deadly riots that forced Fernando de la Rua to resign as president a week ago, Argentina fell deeper into anarchy when interim leader Adolfo Rodriguez Saa quit on Sunday after losing his party's support. Argentina's biggest political force, the Peronists, who ruled from 1989-99, withdrew support from Rodriguez Saa, accusing him of being power-hungry, and convinced other parties to accept in his stead Peronist heavyweight Senator Eduardo Duhalde. Governor Carlos Ruckauf of the vast Buenos Aires province said all parties had to help the Peronists in a national salvation government... with consensus that the person in charge until 2003 should be Duhalde. Already, Latin America's third-largest economy has declared a moratorium on foreign debt payments - Rodriguez Saa's first act as leader - and commerce has halted since cash withdrawals were limited to $1,000 a month to stop a panic run on banks. 'Shameful' Ordinary Argentines have been pouring into the streets night after hot summer night, banging pots and pans demanding, and eventually receiving, the resignation of De la Rua, his unpopular economy minister and aides to Rodriguez Saa who were suspected of corruption. U.S. President George W. Bush said yesterday he was worried about Argentina, but was confident the country would stay together until it chooses a new leader while offering help once things stabilized.
