In search of the most valuable GEMs of all Malcolm Smith on the importance of genetically-engineered micro-organisms. GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital. Soil , for_example , can easily have millions of bacteria ? of very many different species ? in just a gram. A second problem is that many bacteria living & bquo ; in the wild & equo ; are not always easy to culture in the laboratory. Many have fickle requirements and others lie dormant until very precise conditions happen to come along. The researchers have devised a suite of methods based on detecting a marker gene engineered into the GEM. They '_ ve used one that codes for an enzyme called catechol 2,3-dioxygenase ( C230 for short ). It converts catechol ? a naturally occuring substance in ordinary metabolism ? to a vivid yellow compound. But the snag is that first you have to be able to recover the GEMs to culture them to do the catechol yellowing test. This GEM ? like most bacteria ? is n't the smooth cell shape that it looks. Tiny protein structures protrude ? like flagellae to help it move and pili to attach itself to surfaces. So mt-2 '_ s purified pili and flagellae were injected into animals so that they rapidly produced antibodies specific to them. The next step was to chemically link these highly specific antibodies to small magnetised polystyrene spheres. According_to the researchers , highly specific antibodies have ensured that the technique is a success. No confusion was found when they tested them against 200 different isolates of the same , but genetically unmodified , bacterium taken from lake water. There may be ways around this , at_least in part , as Jon Saunders points out. Doubling up on & bquo ; lethal genes & equo ; ? by making a GEM both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ? is a belt and braces approach.
