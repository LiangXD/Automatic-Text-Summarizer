Harsh detention for Afghan prisoners Taleban and al-Qaeda prisoners flown from Afghanistan to an American naval base in the Caribbean are being held in tough conditions of detention. A temporary detention centre called Camp X-Ray has been set up at the base in Guantanamo Bay, an isolated US outpost on the edge of Fidel Castro's Cuba. The prisoners are being housed in cells measuring 1.8 by 2.4 metres (six feet by eight feet) with open, chain-link walls, a concrete floor and wooden roof. They face intense interrogation by US officials anxious to track down Osama Bin Laden, the alleged mastermind behind the 11 September suicide attacks on New York and Washington. Washington wants military tribunals to try the prisoners, and the cases are expected to be heard outside the US. As the base is located outside sovereign territory, the prisoners have no legal rights under the US constitution, and no right of appeal to federal courts. Jeffrey Kofman, an American journalist who has visited the base, said the facility was very, very minimal. International concern The human rights group Amnesty International voiced concern about the cages used for accommodation, saying they would fall below minimum standards for humane treatment. They wore surgical masks as some prisoners had tested positive for tuberculosis and at least one prisoner was sedated. They will spend most of their time separated, although they will be allowed out of their cells in small groups for meals, showers and some recreation. The base - known by US servicemen as Gitmo - is surrounded by mangrove swamps, salt marshes and dense bush - and the sea is shark-infested. Cuban Frontier Battalion troops continue to watch their US counterparts along the 28-kilometre fence, but tension has diminished since the end of the Cold War. Hunt continues American officials have named al-Qaeda and Taleban leaders killed or captured as frustration grows that some senior Taleban figures are reportedly slipping through the net.
