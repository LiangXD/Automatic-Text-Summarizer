26 (CNA) -- It is unlikely that the Vatican will establish diplomatic ties with mainland China any time soon, judging from their differences on religious issues, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said Wednesday. Chang's remark came in response to a foreign wire report that mainland China and the Vatican are preparing to bridge their differences and may even pave the way for full diplomatic relations. Beijing authorities are expected to take advantage of a large religious meeting slated for October 14 in Beijing to develop the possibility of setting up formal relations with the Vatican, according to the report. In response, Chang said the Beijing leadership will have chances to boost exchanges with Holy See officials in the next few weeks, including in the religious meeting to be held Oct.
