The authorities were able to confirm via information provided by the U.S. military that the trawler exchanged messages with the North before it was intercepted by patrol boats off the Japanese island of Amami Oshima. An antisubmarine patrol aircraft was dispatched to the scene and located the vessel Saturday, three days after the authorities had received the information from the United States. Although the defense officials declined to give details of the messages exchanged between the vessel and the North Korean side, they said, The ship may have been involved with the smuggling of drugs used to treat drug addicts.
