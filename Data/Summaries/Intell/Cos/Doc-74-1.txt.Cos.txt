Rostislav Khotin KIEV 1997-03-31 Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on Monday described a planned union between Russia and Belarus as _ nonsense _ that could ruin the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) , the grouping of 12 former Soviet republics. Kuchma was referring to plans by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko to sign a bilateral Union Treaty in Moscow on Wednesday. Link: [Comments: s1 provides the referents for s2's Yeltsin and Lukashenko.] _ I am against unification at different levels inside the CIS $... as this is absolute nonsense. Kuchma was the first foreign leader to meet Lukashenko after a controversial constitutional referendum in Belarus last November which gave the Minsk leader sweeping powers. The Ukrainian leader , usually hesitant to criticise Lukashenko , said he did not support some of the Belarus leader's actions such as his recent crackdowns on the mass media. Kuchma , who met Yeltsin on Saturday after the CIS summit , confirmed the Kremlin leader would visit Kiev , a trip that has been postponed at_least six times. But he added that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would come to Kiev before Yeltsin to discuss economic issues. _ Relations between the two governments have been stopped and this was a tragedy for Ukraine , _ Kuchma said.
