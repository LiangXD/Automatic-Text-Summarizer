Tatiana Vacova BRATISLAVA 1996-08-20 Measures by the National Bank of Slovakia to ease the country's money supply may not be working , as a mounting liquidity surplus continues to drive prices down on the money market , analysts said on Tuesday. They said the market's burgeoning liquidity , which is seen driving rates down by some two percentage points to about 10 percent on all maturities , points to the ineffectiveness of the NBS's recent moves to take money out_of circulation. _ The central bank will have to take other measures to stem the money supply , as the effect of the tool it chose to do so is partly eliminated by short-term foreign capital inflows , _ Jozef Bozek of Tatra Banka told Reuters. Last month , the NBS drove interbank interest rates to over 14 percent when , in a move to curtail banks' short-term lending , hiked minimum reserves significantly as_of August 1. The NBS hard currency reserves rose to $3.71 billion as_of August 14 , from $3.43 billion on July 24 , pouring out onto the money market and catching analysts who were expecting a puacity of funds off guard.
