15 Stretching The Case For Inhumanity Terrorist thugs at Gitmo don't deserve their treatment By Vito Fossella Having had the opportunity to tour Camp X-Ray last week, I offer America's critics a simple piece of advice: Get a life. Far from being treated inhumanely, the al Qaeda and the Taliban terrorists are better fed, better clothed and better cared for than they would be if they were still roaming the cold caves of Afghanistan. Indeed, the evil-doers at Camp X-Ray are getting far better treatment than they deserve - hot showers, a warm Caribbean climate and access to the exact same medical care as the military personnel who live on the base. Indeed, since their arrival at Camp-X-Ray, some of the terrorists have openly threatened the Marines who guard them and talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing the American people. At Guantanamo Bay, federal officials are conducting extensive interviews with the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists, culling information on the terrorist network and the whereabouts and future plans of the tens of thousands of terrorists who were trained in the same camps and who are now living around the world. The type of work that is occurring at Camp X-Ray may prove critical to preventing a new attack. America's treatment of the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists at Camp X-Ray is appropriate and, in my opinion, too good for these murderous thugs. Instead of lecturing the United States, our critics may better spend their time reminding others that if terrorists don't want to be detained at Camp X-Ray, they should join the civilized world.
