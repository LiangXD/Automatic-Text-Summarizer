Nairobi, April 26 Kyodo -- A Kenyan national working for Japan's leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper was shot dead Thursday night in Nairobi in a botched car robbery, police sources said Friday. They shot at him as he tried to open the door to the car, and died on arrival to a nearby hospital, a senior policewoman, Chief Inspector Nancy Thuku, told Kyodo News in Nairobi. A senior police officer was shot dead two months ago by armed gangsters in the same crime-prone area where Ndegwa was killed.
