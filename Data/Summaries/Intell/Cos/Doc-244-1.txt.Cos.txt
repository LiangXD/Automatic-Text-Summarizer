's big defense and automotive electronics unit, GM Hughes Electronics, said net income fell 22% in the third quarter, reflecting declining military spending and slumping GM vehicle production. Meanwhile, net at GM's finance arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp., fell 3.1%. By contrast, Electronic Data Systems Corp., GM's data processing subsidiary, boosted net 16%. In addition, GM's North American vehicle production fell 8.4% from a year ago, which hurt Delco Electronic's earnings, a company spokesman said. In the nine months, GM Hughes net fell 6.6% to $486.6 million, or $1.48 a share, from $521 million, or $1.58 a share. GMAC said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35% in the U.S., largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales. At EDS, third-quarter profit jumped 16% to a record $110.9 million, or 93 cents a share, from $95.9 million, or 79 cents a share. Revenue from non-GM accounts was 45% of EDS's total business in the latest nine months, compared with 40% a year earlier.
