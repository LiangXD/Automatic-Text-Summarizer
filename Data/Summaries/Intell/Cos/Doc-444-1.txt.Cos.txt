I hope you'll consider continuing your support of Jameson's special campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx. Many more camper referrals are coming from new organizations such as school social-workers and family counseling agencies. It seems summer options aren't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes, so we're doing all we can to make Jameson available. Even after the summer sessions come to a close, Jameson campers will take part in year-round programs designed to keep that positive contact with peers and role models alive and important. We've scheduled more than 15 follow-up camper weekends beginning in September and going around till next summers camping season.
