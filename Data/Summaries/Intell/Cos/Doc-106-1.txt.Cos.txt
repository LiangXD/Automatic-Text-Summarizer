Google Proposes Android Revenue for Oracle: Filing Google is willing to pay Oracle a percentage of Android revenue on two patents if Oracle succeeds in proving patent infringement at an upcoming trial over the Java programming language, according to a court filing. Oracle said, however, that the proposed damages from Google are too low, according to the document, which the two companies filed jointly. Earlier this month, Oracle agreed to withdraw several claims after some of its patents were struck down by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
