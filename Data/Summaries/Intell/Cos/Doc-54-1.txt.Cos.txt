A 200-metre belt of trees has been planted on each side of the Yongding, Chaobai, Dasha and Wenyu rivers, which was previously the city's most desertificated land. By 2005, 50 per cent of Beijing's land, including both urban and rural areas, will have been covered with trees. Over the next 10 years, China will invest 6 billion yuan (US$720 million) to prevent sandstorms hitting Beijing, according to sources from the State Forestry Administration. It is believed that sand from northern areas, especially the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and floating dust from the city's uncovered construction sites are the main causes.
