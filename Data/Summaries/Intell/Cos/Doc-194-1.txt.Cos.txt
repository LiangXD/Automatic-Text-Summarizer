Bosnian authorities have handed over to US custody six Algerians detained in October on suspicion of involvement in terrorism but ordered released this week by a local court, the US embassy said on Friday. In Washington, a senior official told Reuters the US military planned to quickly move the six to the American Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees from the war in Afghanistan are being held. Washington insisted it would not have acted without credible evidence, but the transfer exposed it to more criticism from campaigners who have accused it of disregarding human rights in its declared war on terror. A Bosnian government official said legal procedures had been respected in the case, but a senior UN human rights officer in Bosnia said they had been trampled over. Not only had a court ordered their release on Thursday but the state's top human rights body had instructed authorities to prevent four being taken out of the country by force. It's very disappointing, Madeleine Rees, head of the Bosnia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said of the operation. International officials said US officials had not been willing to provide Bosnia's justice system with the intelligence information that prompted their detention. A Bosnian government official insisted the appeal had already been rejected and legal procedures had been followed. He said the government had not been aware of the ruling by Bosnia's Human Rights Chamber that measures should be taken to stop four of the suspects being taken out of the country.
