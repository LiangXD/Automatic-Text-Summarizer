But the EU is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce US emissions. The Climate Change Convention of 1992, to which the US is a Party, requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels. By 2005, the EU intends to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of all CO2 emissions in 2010. The EU welcomes the fact that the Bush administration has now completed its policy review and has put forward what the US intends to do in terms of domestic climate change policy. The proposals by President Bush may represent a first step in the right direction, where also economic operators in the US are asked to contribute to emission control. However, mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions at company level would be necessary to adequately assess whether the proposals by President Bush represent an effort comparable to the ones under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU will continue on its current path of emission reduction and is optimistic that other major players, notably Japan and Russia, will join us in these efforts.
