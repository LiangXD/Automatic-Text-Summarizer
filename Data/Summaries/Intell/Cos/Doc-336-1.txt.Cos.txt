Space station commander Frank Culbertson had eagerly awaited the arrival of Endeavour, his ride home. He watched as the shuttle, a ghostly white against the blackness of space, drew ever closer. As Endeavour slowly closed the final 40 feet, Culbertson rang the ship's bell aboard the space station and announced in the tradition of the high seas, "Endeavour arriving." Culbertson and his crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin, will move out of the space station today.
