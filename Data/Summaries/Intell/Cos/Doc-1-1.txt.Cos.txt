June exports eased a slight 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion while imports dropped 3.3 percent to $77.82 billion. The deficit with China climbed 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion in June , surpassing the $3.24 billion deficit with Japan that was up 3.6 percent from May. Commerce noted that exports of American-made goods to China declined for a fourth straight month in June , which is likely to fuel trade tensions between the two countries. Steady improvement in shrinking the deficit with Japan was the main reason that China became the leading deficit nation in June , Commerce officials said. The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits. In June , the merchandise deficit fell 13.9 percent to $14.46 billion from $16.79 billion in May. Lower imports of new cars and parts , especially from Japan and Germany , helped shrink the merchandise trade gap. The deficit with oil-producing OPEC countries dropped 26.9 percent in June to $1.40 billion from $1.91 billion in May.
