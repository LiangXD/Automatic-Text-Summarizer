3 (CNA) -- Premier Chang Chun-hsiung expressed alarm Thursday at reports that a legislator was kidnapped and held for three days in a Taipei hotel, saying that his government will do its utmost to stop gangsters from preying on lawmakers. Presiding over an inter-agency conference on social order, Chang asked the police to catch the gangsters who allegedly detained Legislator Huang Hsien-chou at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Taipei. Chang Fu-shun, 27, is said to be the younger brother of Chang Hui-hua, who allegedly invited Huang to meet her at the hotel and who Huang claimed was in the hotel room when he was detained. Huang claimed the previous day in Taichung that he had been trapped by the gangsters, who had pretended to be his political supporters.
