Please believe ME , I '_ m ill ME sufferers are sick of doctors not taking them seriously and have made a cinema ad to win support for their case. You may be written off as a malingerer or a neurotic or , perhaps even worse , as someone who must be gently humoured back to health. It '_ s your head that needs them , not your legs. & equo ; & bquo ; Women of your age imagine aches and pains ? are you sure you '_ re not attention seeking ? & equo ; & bquo ; We all have to die sometimes. & equo ; & bquo ; I '_ m not prepared to do any tests. I wish you '_ d take yourself away from me. & equo ; & bquo ; You middle class women have nothing_else to worry about. & equo ; & bquo ; It '_ s one of those things you silly young women get. & equo ; & bquo ; Stop feeling sorry for yourself. I have patients with real illnesses ? patients who are dying from cancer. & equo ; & bquo ; Go home and have more babies. & equo ; Surgery encounters like these have become increasingly common over the past 30 years with the erosion of the traditional divisions between sickness and health , which have led to , among other things , the medicalisation of & bquo ; anxiety. & equo ;. Until the launch of the so-called & bquo ; minor tranquillisers & equo ; in the early Sixties , anxiety was seen as an inevitable everyday experience , and , moreover , as a valuable psychological spur compelling us to take stock of things if they went wrong. Doctors are now increasingly reluctant to prescribe tranquillisers for fear of being sued by patients who become addicted to them. According_to one theory , held by some psychiatrists , patients may find doctors increasingly unsympathetic to their plight.

The alleged remarks by doctors to patients quoted above were taken from an Action Campaign survey highlighting & bquo ; bad & equo ; treatment. The Action Campaign is also seeking support from medical journalists , and I have been asked repeatedly if I was going to add to the & bquo ; adverse & equo ; ME publicity.
