He told Reuters in an interview the cash generated by such investment would go back into the companies instead_of into the state budget as with direct privatisations. _ At the moment Bulgaria is ideal for foreign investors in some ways because here you can buy low and sell high because_of the general depression we are in at the moment , _ Marinov said. Marinov said that of the 1,150 enterprises controlled by his ministry , 845 made a profit last financial year and the rest made a loss. Marinov said floating the companies would make the privatisation process more transparent as potential investors would have open access to financial data. _ It_ 's a half-way house to attracting foreign investment but also it_ 's an end in itself to create a stock-owner society. _ Bulgaria's mass privatisation programme has issued eight billion levs of stock but at present there is no clear procedure for trading it. The former Socialist government officially abolished direct subsidies to loss-makers but tried to keep the firms going through payouts from state-owned commercial banks , several of which are now in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings. _ This was a very complicated scheme of subsidising the loss-making enterprises , which did no good to the economy as a whole and to the enterprises as well , _ Marinov said. Rather_than the lists of companies for liquidation drawn up with the previous government , the interim cabinet agreed with the IMF and World Bank to eliminate a proportion of losses , a more flexible approach if individual cases are held up. If it is successful then Bulgaria will open up_to the West much faster than through other means , _ Marinov said.
