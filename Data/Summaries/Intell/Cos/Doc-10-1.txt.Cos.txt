Michael Georgy DUBAI 1996-08-20 Tehran is banking on Malaysia's Petronas acquisition of a 30 percent stake in a project to develop two oil and gas fields in Iran to deflect intense U.S. efforts to isolate the Islamic republic. _ This shows that unilateral moves can_ not isolate the Iranian oil industry. Iran is a risky market. _ French oil group Total SA on Monday said Malaysia's state-owned energy company Petronas had taken a 30 percent stake in the Sirri A and E fields through its Carigali subsidiary in a deal approved by the Iranian authorities. It will be seen by Washington as open defiance of Clinton's bill , _ said one analyst. _ At the same time , companies will be taking a risk if they invest in Iran. _ But a British diplomat underlined the rift between the United States and its European allies who were outraged at the U.S. sanctions. _ We will be perfectly content to trade with Iran. There are opportunites in Iran and European companies will follow their governments _' leads , _ the Gulf-based diplomat said. _ Other companies are likely to follow Petronas's lead. _ Total , which has always said its dealings with both Iran and Libya were within French and international law , said earlier this month that the U.S. sanctions would not apply to Sirri. DuPont Co unit Conoco Inc had to dissolve an earlier deal with Iran for the development of the two Sirri fields after pressure from the White House.
