Geneva, May 10 (XINHUA) -- The insurer Swiss Life has pulled the plug on its planned expansion in China, preferring to concentrate on its core European markets, according to a report by Swiss Radio International (SRI). A spokeswoman said the insurer did not have a license to sell life insurance in China. The report said that Chinese mainland was seen as a massive potential market for insurers, who should find it gradually easier to sell their products now that Beijing had joined the World Trade Organization.
