Many people have been arrested in the past weeks, including suspected separatists and criminals, said an official at the minority religious affairs bureau in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China's furthest west city. Public sentencing rallies have been going on in many counties around Kashgar, the official, who identified himself only as Yakefu, told AFP. Another official said Thursday the main expert on Xinjiang from the US embassy in Beijing had been dispatched to the region to discuss regional attitudes to the devastating terror attacks on the US two weeks ago and to Afganistan's ruling ultra-Islamic Taliban regime. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday China would take all necessary measures to ensure the stability of its border regions ahead of any US retaliatory strikes. She stressed the atmosphere in Kashgar, an ancient city along the historic Silk Road, was peaceful, although tourism and border trade in the region had been affected by the security situation. In neighboring Hetian city, a hotbed of Muslim separatists in the impoverished southern part of Xinjiang that also borders Pakistan, the situation was also peaceful , said an official at the city's foreign affairs office.
