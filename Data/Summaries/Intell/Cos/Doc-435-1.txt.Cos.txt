Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring, responsible adult volunteers with at-risk girls, ages 8-14. A Big Sister is a mentor, a friend and a role model, helping a young girl to develop the self-confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible, productive and successful adult. The results of an 18-month study completed by Public/Private Ventures showed that children participating in one-to-one Big Sister and Big Brother matches for just one year, reduced first time drug use by 46%; lowered school absenteeism by 52%; cut aggressive behavior by 33%; enhanced school performance; and improved relations with family and friends. As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of your match and be identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office, in the agency newsletter and annual report. Today Big Sisters serves over 1,000 girls in central Indiana. Imagine the difference the community could make if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match!
