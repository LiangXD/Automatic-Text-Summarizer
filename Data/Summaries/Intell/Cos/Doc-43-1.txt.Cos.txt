Fumiko Fujisaki TOKYO 1997-03-31 Japan's beleaguered banks got a break on Monday when the stock market ended the financial year above a key level , helping them avoid losses on their large share portfolios from pushing them into the red. Many banks had based their financial projections on a close of 18,000 to 18,500 , industry analysts say , meaning they will not have to take further unplanned write-offs on their stock holdings. While Japan's top 20 banks must take appraisal losses worth about 1.7 trillion yen ( $13.7 billion ) on shareholdings in 1996/97 , it is unlikely that many will fall into the red , industry analysts said. Japanese banks have traditionally held large chunks of shares in other companies , many of them customers. Analysts said the top 20 banks would stick to their plans to dispose of about 5.0 trillion yen ( $40.3 billion ) worth of problem loans for 1996/97 despite the appraisal losses. Thanks_to declines in market interest rates , operating profits at big banks are estimated to be about 10 percent larger than the 4.0 trillion yen ( $32.3 billion ) the banks had forecast for 1996/97. NCB is likely to post losses for the second straight year in 1996/97 to write off big problem loans to recover investors' confidence in the bank , analysts said. Second-most vulnerable is the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd , which is estimated to post shareholding losses when the Nikkei falls to 17,600 or below.
