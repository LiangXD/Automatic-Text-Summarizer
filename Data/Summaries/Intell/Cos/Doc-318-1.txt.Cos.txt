One orbit, or 1 hours later, South African President Thabo Mbeki called to congratulate the first African citizen in space. As for his liftoff two days earlier from Kazakhstan, "I had moments of terror, moments of sheer upliftment and exhilaration," Shuttleworth said. "I have truly never seen anything as beautiful as the Earth from space. The world's latest space tourist -- dubbed an Afronaut back home -- has generated huge excitement in South Africa. "The whole continent is proud that, at last, we have one of our own people from Africa up in space," said Mbeki, taking part in celebrations for Freedom Day, marking the 1994 elections that ended Apartheid. Shuttleworth's parents were relieved to see their adventure-seeking son, an entrepreneur who made his fortune off the Internet, safely aboard space station Alpha. They watched from Russian Mission Control outside Moscow as the Soyuz capsule smoothly docked with the space station 250 miles up. To avoid further conflict, NASA and the space agencies of Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan established criteria for future space station visitors. Shuttleworth met all the guidelines and went through eight months of cosmonaut training in Russia and one week of instruction at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Because of his U.S. training, Shuttleworth will have more leeway aboard the space station than Tito did. Shuttleworth, who is among the world's younger space travelers, joined his country's president on Saturday in calling for "a need for Africans to embrace the future and the importance of education, and especially science and mathematics."
