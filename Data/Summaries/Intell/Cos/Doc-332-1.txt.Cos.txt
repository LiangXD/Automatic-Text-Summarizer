Peronist to head Argentina at least till March elections BUENOS AIRES - Veteran Peronist Adolfo Rodriguez Saa was set to become the country's interim president yesterday, taking power after a devastating economic crisis toppled President Fernando de la Rua. De la Rua was brought down after violent protests against his economic steps left 27 people dead and more than 200 people injured. His appointment would restore Argentina's largest party, the Peronists, as the country's dominant political force after the most widespread social disturbances since the late 1980s, when a previous financial crisis rocked this South American country of 36 million. He has reportedly suggested Argentina will have to declare a moratorium on payments on its crushing debt load and has vowed to leave in place a key economic law pegging the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. Polls indicate that a majority of Argentines support keeping the peg in place, despite increased calls from many economists and several political leaders that only a devaluation can help the economy rebound. Argentines wary of surging unemployment, rising poverty, salary cuts and tax hikes are deeply skeptical of more calls for belt-tightening, the centerpiece of policies advocated by De la Rua and his economy minister Domingo Cavallo. Rodriguez Saa is reportedly considering easing banking restrictions imposed by De la Rua, limiting to $1,000 the amount of money Argentines can withdraw from their accounts.
