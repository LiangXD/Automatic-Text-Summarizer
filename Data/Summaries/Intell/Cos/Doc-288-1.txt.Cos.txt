Mugabe confident of victory in historic Zimbabwe vote HARARE-Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe predicted victory Saturday as he cast his ballots in presidential and local elections at a primary school in Harare's working-class suburb of Highfield. Tinkering has left voting procedures so confusing in Harare that even Mugabe and his top aides appeared unsure of where the president was to vote. Several of Mugabe's ministers and senior aides were also on hand to see their leader cast his ballot, as well as a throng of reporters and camera operators.
