TOKYO, Feb 15 (AFP) - Japan Friday welcomed President George W. Bush's alternative to the Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gases, but said it will press on with ratification of the pact the US rejected. Bush may raise the greenhouse gas matter when he visits Japan for a three-day stay starting Sunday, although Japan's weakened economy is expected to be the focus of talks.
