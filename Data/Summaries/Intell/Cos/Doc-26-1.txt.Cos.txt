Gary Hill INDIANAPOLIS , Indiana 1997-03-30 There were casualties in Saturday night's NCAA semifinal battles but the victors said Sunday that everybody would be ready for Monday's national championship game. But come game day , there would be no mercy. _ Because of all those cramps he got the option to rest , and he should come out really fired up tomorrow , because he rested yesterday , _ Pitino said with a smile. Arizona's useful backup guard Jason Terry played only 20 minutes , his lowest total of the season , and was taken to a hospital for tests and intravenous treatment after he fell during the Wildcats' upset of North Carolina. _ We were going to put him in late in the game , _ said Arizona coach Lute Olson. _ He had played a lot before that , of_course , but when we_ 're protecting a lead , we like getting four perimeter guys in_there and that gives us another ( ball ) handler , gives us another free throw shooter. _ And I called for him to come and Ed Orr , our trainer , said Coach , he ca_ n't go. Olson added : _ He did leave a deposit in the ambulance on the way to the hospital , so he was a sick puppy last night. But I think he_ 's fine today. _ Kentucky's quiet young point guard Wayne Turner said : _ Physically there was a_lot_of bumping and banging. If I left the game without bumps and feeling really tired , I would have cheated my team. _ Pitino predicted that Monday's championship game would be more of the same , in view of Kentucky's all-out pressure defence and Arizona's blazing speed : _ I think the team standing at the end is going to win this.
