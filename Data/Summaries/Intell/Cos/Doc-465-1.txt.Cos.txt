At the time when the abortive coup had just taken place, the United States did not show the slightest sympathy, still less the least regret, for the breaking-off of Venezuela's democratic system. Both the White House and the US State Department expressed satisfaction over the stepping-down of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's constitutional president, and no one wept over him. This special meeting was initiated by the United States, with only one single goal to fulfill, that is, instigating OPCW member states to vote out Bustani. After Chavez took office as Venezuelan president, he has pursued an independent foreign policy, and has been out of step with the United States in many areas. To the United States, what Bustani wanted to do was even more intolerable, as it would disrupt the US plan of launching a military strike against Iraq. Even some major media in the United States have thoroughly unmasked the attitude taken by the US Government towards the cope farce in Venezuela. According to New York Times, the United States is inclined to put friendly faces in the Presidential Palace of Latin American nations, no matter whether or not these faces are wearing army uniforms. In simpler terms, the interests of the United States are always above everything else, not only above the sovereignty of other nations, but also above the so-called values of democracy and human rights that the US always likes to dwell on.
