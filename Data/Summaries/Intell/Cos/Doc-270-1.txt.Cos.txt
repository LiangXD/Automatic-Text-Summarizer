Dow Jones said it extended the offer to allow shareholders time to review a supplement to the Dow Jones tender offer circular that it mailed last Friday. The supplement contains various information that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since Dow Jones launched the offer on Sept. Late last week, representatives of Dow Jones and Telerate began negotiations about the terms of the offer, but those talks didn't result in any changes in the offer. Dow Jones, which owns 67% of Telerate, publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases.
