The space shot might be rescheduled for this evening, but a decision won't be made until this morning, a NASA official said Thursday. Sensors and photos showed that debris about the width of a piece of string or wire is preventing a solid fit on the docking, said Jim Van Laak, NASA manager of operations and integration for the space station. Van Laak said Russian space officials believe the soft bump that happens when Endeavour docks at other port on the station would not jar the Russian supply ship loose. But NASA officials want further study because they are concerned it might damage the locking mechanism for the supply ship.
