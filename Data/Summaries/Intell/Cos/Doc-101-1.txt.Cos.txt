The Geraldton Western Australia, which is one of 10 68-foot vessels competing in the Clipper 11-12 Round the World Yacht Race, encountered rough weather in the Pacific Ocean, race organizers said. The injured were named by race organizers as Nik Brbora, 28, Jane Hitchins, 50, and Mark Burkes, 37, from Britain; and Max Wilson, 62, from Australia. We were racing along in 40-60 knot gusts, the boat's skipper Juan Coetzer said. A US Coast Guard cutter and helicopter were en route to the stricken vessel and were due to arrive there by 8:30am local time, race organizers said. Once in range, plans call for the helicopter to fly to the yacht and lower a rescue swimmer to assess the injured boaters, the Coast Guard said in a statement. At that time, the rescue crew will determine the further needs of the injured persons. Coast Guard Petty Officer Levi Read told NewsCore he was only aware of three injured on the vessel, but would know more once they reached the boat.
