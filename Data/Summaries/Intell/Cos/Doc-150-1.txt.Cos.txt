President Hugo Chavez has warned that certain sectors have once again taken up the idea of looking forceful way out in Venezuela, either through a coup or an attack that would end his life. The president charged that attacks targeting his person have gone on for over 10 years, and that he has been accused, among other things, of ties with the guerrillas, of buying arms and trying to set up a communist regime in Venezuela. Chavez said that more efforts would be made in 2002 to get the country moving ahead since he believes that it will be quite difficult politically, economically and socially. He noted that as the year draws to a close, the indicators are positive for Venezuela, then emphasized that the country has regained such internationally recognized posts as the presidency of the Group of the 15 and the Group of the 77. As for Argentina's decision not to pay its debt, the president said the measure would give the economy and people some breathing room. The chief of state also recalled that the previous governments viewed the Colombian guerrillas as enemies of Venezuela, which led to operations in Colombian territory to attack the rebel groups. We were meddling in an internal conflict of another country, which is a violation of international law and which in turn gave the guerrillas the right to attack our military units.
