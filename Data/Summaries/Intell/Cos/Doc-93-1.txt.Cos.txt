NEW YORK 1997-03-31 Coram Healthcare Corp stock fell Monday after the company said its merger partner Integrated Health Services Inc lowered the amount it will pay for Coram , traders said. Integrated Health said Monday that based on the closing price of its stock on the last business day before execution of the new terms , it would be paying $4.35 per Coram share. The deal then was worth $655 million , $280 million of that contained in the equity part of the transaction and the balance in the assumption of Coram debt and other financial obligations. A Coram spokesman said the new terms were negotiated in response to the _ overall pressure on the IV ( intravenous ) therapy industry. Coram has been given more certainty of the merger closing by virtue of the $25 million breakup fee _ contained in the new terms that go into effect this Friday. The same amount of debt is being assumed. _ _ We have been recommending Integrated Health , _ Ray said. _ The transaction makes a_lot_of sense for the intermediate $- and long-run.
