Yeom Yoon-jeong SEOUL 1997-03-31 South Korea's ailing won shot up 2.25 percent against the dollar on Monday after the government announced steps to open stock and bond markets wider to foreigners. After the stock market closed , the government announced it would raise the foreign stock holding ceiling to 23 percent of a listed firm from the current 20 percent , effective from May 1. The government would also allow domestic financial institutions to raise funds in Asia and Europe for investment in the local bond market this year. The won has fallen about 13 percent against the dollar since the beginning of last year , pushed lower by a ballooning current account deficit. In the past few weeks , speculators have been betting against the won , calculating the central bank is losing its ability to defend the currency due_to dwindling foreign exchange reserves. The government estimated the measures would attract an additional $8 billion this year , bringing foreign capital infow to $28 billion , instead_of an earlier estimated $20 billion. But economists and dealers said they did not believe Monday's announcements would have a fundamental impact on the won. _ The moves will not reverse the dollar's bullishness , _ said a Hana Bank dealer. _ Why should the won strengthen , when the dollar continues to rise in world markets ? _ The yield on three-year benchmark corporate bonds closed at 12.50 percent , down from 12.66 percent on Saturday.
