Bush Takes Great Leap Forward In Pledging U.S. Help In Defending Taiwan In a closed-door meeting in Florida last week, the Bush administration took a great leap forward in its declared policy that Taiwan remain separate from China so long as the people of Taiwan wish, even if that requires U.S. military force. The centerpiece was a visit by Taiwan's defense minister, Tang Yao-ming, the first since President Carter switched U.S. diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979. The senior U.S. official at the gathering was Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who has written: It would be a strategic as well as a moral mistake for the United States to ever let China use force to have its way with Taiwan. The TRA, adopted after Carter broke relations with Taiwan, commits the United States to provide defensive arms to Taiwan and to view a threat from China with grave concern. Bush has repeatedly referred to the TRA in a not-so-subtle message to China that the law is the bedrock of his posture on Taiwan. The most succinct statement of the Bush policy came from Secretary of State Colin Powell during his Senate confirmation hearing in January 2001: We expect and demand a peaceful settlement, one acceptable to people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Shortly after Bush took office, he approved the largest U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, allowing Taiwan to buy four destroyers, eight diesel-powered submarines, 12 anti-submarine aircraft and a flock of missiles and other weapons. At the same time, he said the United States would do whatever it takes to help defend Taiwan. Whatever decision Bush makes, a defense official said, the Pacific Command is ready to respond to any potential crisis, including the use of force against Taiwan by China.
