Roger Fillion WASHINGTON 1997-03-31 Regulators will host an auction Tuesday that supporters promise will usher in a new breed of nationwide radio service but critics charge may cost U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars in lost revenue. Up for grabs are two licenses to provide radio programming that will be beamed coast-to-coast via satellite. Digital radio will offer listeners CD-quality sound and specialized programming that can be tuned in anywhere in the nation. _ Americans will be able to travel anywhere in the country , including remote rural areas where radio reception is poor , and enjoy the same high-quality audio and wide selection of programs the entire trip , _ said William Caldwell , president of Seattle-based Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corp. , one of the bidders at the Federal Communications Commission sale. The FCC resolved a long-standing dispute among its four commissioners in early March by limiting the auction to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital radio. Hundt said that if other companies value the digital radio airwaves but are _ arbitrarily excluded from the auction , it is safe to predict that the auction winners will simply sell their licenses to those companies. _ Aside_from DBSC , the other three bidders are : CD Radio Inc. of Washington , D.C. ; American Mobile Radio Corp. , a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston , Va. ; and Primosphere LP of New York. Digital radio is unlikely to be on the air for at_least three years $-- if not longer $-- owing_to the time it takes to get satellites built and deployed into orbit.
