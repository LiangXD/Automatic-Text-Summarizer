By Richard Longworth DIESEL engines are the most fuel efficient vehicle power source available. Trucks , buses and most taxis use them , and 40 per_cent of vehicle fuel sold in the UK last year was diesel. Diesel engine manufacturers have long maintained that these are harmless , but recently they have been found to contain polyaromatich hydrocarbons ( PAH ) , which can cause cancer when breathed deeply. It is small wonder that the truck and bus manufacturers based in areas hit worst by acid rain , Volvo and Scania in Sweden and MAN in Bavaria , are working hardest to cut pollutants. The result will be a common level of NOx and particular emissions from vehicles ( measured in grammes per kilowat hour ) from vehicles sold in Europe after 1991. NOx be cut to 11.8g/Kw/hr , and particulates to 11.8 g/Kw/hr , That level will still be significantly higher than US levels , but much lower than vehicles currently being sold. While the first level of cuts can be reached using existing levels of technology , the second stage , likely in 1994 , will require a new generation of engines. Some manufacturers such as MAN and DAF have solved the problem by fitting filters which clean themselves with a small furnace as the vehicle is in operation. Unlike lead , which the fuel companies eventually proved only too pleased to take out_of petrol , sulphur does nothing for either the performance or longevity of diesel engines and it contributes to acid rain. Currently , diesel fuel sold in the EC contains 0.3 per_cent sulphur , except in West Germany where the level is 0.25 per_cent. London buses , for_example , are exempt from traffic lawsaffecting other vehicles , which in the competitive deregulated world of modern bus operation , include expensive pollution control.
