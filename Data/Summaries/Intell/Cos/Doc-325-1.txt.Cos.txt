U.S. accuses Mugabe of intimidation SubHead: President predicts victory as opposition alleges vote rigging Author: Nicholas Kotch and Cris Chinaka HARARE - On the eve of the presidential vote, Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's President, predicted he would once again storm to victory, as the opposition charged wholesale rigging of the vote and a minister said the army was on high alert. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, accused Mr. Mugabe of using militants from his ruling Zimbabwean African National Unity-Patriotic Front party to try to destroy the MDC over the past two years and undermining the integrity and independence of the police. The government has denied reports of a possible army coup to support Mr. Mugabe if he loses. He was referring to Mr. Blair's condemnation of Mr. Mugabe, who accuses him in turn of interfering in Britain's former colony to engineer an opposition victory. Mr. Mugabe, whose campaigning energy belies his 78 years, oozed confidence at his final rally at Bindura, northeast of Harare, and launched a stinging attack on Mr. Blair. Mr. Tsvangirai, who celebrates his 50th birthday tomorrow, accuses Mr. Mugabe of using violence, intimidation, special laws and dirty tricks to fix the two-day election, in which the President faces his toughest challenge since independence in 1980.
