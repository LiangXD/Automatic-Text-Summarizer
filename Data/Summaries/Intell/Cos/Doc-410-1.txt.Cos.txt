December 10, 1996 Dear Mailhouse donor reminder: You and I have done some important work together. We've helped people break free of the welfare cycle. We've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce. You have helped make Goodwill's work possible with your previous support. And there are a lot of people who face these challenges every day of their lives. Everyone benefits from the work we do together.
