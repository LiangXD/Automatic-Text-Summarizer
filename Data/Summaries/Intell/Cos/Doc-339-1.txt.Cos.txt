'Axis of evil' charge raises questions WASHINGTON -- President Bush's declaration that countries such as Iran, Iraq and North Korea represent an "axis of evil" that must be prevented from acquiring weapons of mass destruction touched off questions around the globe Wednesday. The president told Congress that Iran, Iraq and North Korea pose "a grave and growing danger" because they seek weapons of mass destruction and have links with terrorist groups. President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, whose attempt at reforms have gotten American support, accused the United States of "warmongering." Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, responding to Bush's "axis of evil" remark, said the U.S. government "is the source of evil" in the world. But Bush's pledge to do whatever is necessary to stop them and nations like them appeared to represent a significant hardening of the U.S. position. But U.S. officials have watched with chagrin in recent weeks as Iran has funneled weapons to its proxies in western Afghanistan and attempted to ship sophisticated arms to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. As with Iran, the Bush administration has tried talk and threats with North Korea. After assuming office, Bush initially declined to continue the Clinton administration's talks with Pyongyang on halting its development and export of ballistic missiles but eventually offered talks. The president also named Iraq as a nation that "continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror."
