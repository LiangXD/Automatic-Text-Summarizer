INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC Talks between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) about a free trade area went smoothly, senior officials said yesterday. But the official declined to disclose details about their two-day negotiations, saying these are just working level talks and more substantial progress will be made at the China and ASEAN economic ministers' meeting in September. The third China-ASEAN Economic Senior Official's meeting, held in Beijing on Tuesday, set up a trade negotiation committee to hold in-depth discussions on the framework of a free trade area in the region. A study by Chinese and ASEAN experts shows China's export to ASEAN will increase 55.1 per cent to US$10.6 billion and ASEAN's export to China will increase 48 per cent to US$13 billion after the establishment of the free trade area.
