Underpinning all these accomplishments is the camel '_ s efficient use of metabolic fuel ? a skill put to good use by Mohammed '_ s camel , which allegedly covered the distance between Mecca and Jerusalem in four bounds. K. Yousef of the University of Nevada gathered recently in Australia to investigate the camel '_ s fuel economy. Analysis of the gas in the balloon told the team how much oxygen the camels were using as they walked. This figure is directly related to the rate of consumption of metabolic fuel ? the camel '_ s equivalent of mpg. Over the same distance , people use two and a half times more energy ( per kilogram of their bulk ) than the average camel. Although large animals are generally more efficient at walking than small ones ? just as trains outperform cars ? the camel is in an altogether different league. Most animals increase their fuel consumption in proportion to the extra baggage they are carrying , but not the camel. The findings throw fresh light on the camel '_ s former popularity both as pack animal and military mount. Equally perceptively , Napoleon Bonaparte founded his own crack camel corps after studying the progress of a desert caravan. As the Christmas story demonstrates , more peace-loving potentates also appreciate the camel '_ s skills. Zoologists have yet to establish the precise mechanisms behind the camel '_ s fuel economy. One candidate is the leg musculature , which may turn out to be constructed from slower , more efficient fibres than those employed elsewhere. Camels operate each foreleg and its associated hindleg in unison , more_like a pantomime horse than a regular quadruped.
