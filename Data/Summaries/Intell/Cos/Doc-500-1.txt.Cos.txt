DURBAN March 19 Sapa SA OBSERVER: ZIM ELECTIONS NOT FREE AND FAIR Another member of the South African Observer Mission to Zimbabwe says the past weekend's presidential election in the southern African country was not free and fair. Methodist Bishop Purity Malinga on Tuesday echoed the sentiments of South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairwoman Brigalia Bam that Zimbabwe election did not conform to international standards. Bam on Sunday said she believed Zimbabwe's election was not free and fair, adding they were not in line with international standards as well as those of her organisation. Malinga, who represented South African churches on 50-member mission, told journalists during breakfast at the Diakonia Council of Churches in Durban, that she was uncomfortable with the manner in which the team had been treated -- even before they left South Africa. Malinga said according to the guidelines in the booklet, the election had been legitimate. SAOM on Monday stopped short of declaring the Zimbabwean presidential election free and fair, but the African National Congress majority on the committee declared the poll credible. The Inkatha Freedom Party, Democratic Alliance, New National Party, African Christian Democratic Party, the Pan Africanist Congress and the United Christian Democratic Party had disagreed with the ANC conclusion. Other delegates in SAOM aligned themselves with the findings of the Southern African Development Community parliamentary forum that said the vote had not met SADC's norms and standards. The United States, Britain, local Zimbabwean observers, and the Commonwealth observer team also described the poll as not free and fair.
