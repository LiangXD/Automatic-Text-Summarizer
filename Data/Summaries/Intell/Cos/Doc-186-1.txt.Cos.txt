The head of the Spanish Government, Jose Maria Aznar, told Argentine President Fernando de la Rua that Spain has absolute confidence in Argentina's economy, and that Madrid has placed a strategic bet on Argentina overcoming its economic crisis, said official sources in Spain. The Spanish leader also took advantage of the occasion to tell the Argentine head of state about his last telephone conversation--which took place on Monday [15 October]--with US President George W. Bush, regarding the progress of military operations in Afghanistan.
