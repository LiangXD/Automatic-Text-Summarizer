Avaulta Mesh: Patients Are Not the Women They Once Were Washington, DC: Avaulta mesh is but one player in a women's health issue that, to some in the legal profession, represent a particularly alarming portfolio that sees many patients no longer existing as the women they once were. Lawyers and industry watchers have found that lawsuits appear to be on the rise since the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings against vaginal mesh products in July of last year. While problems with the surgically implanted product—used to treat incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse (POP)—have been suspected and alleged for years, only recently did the FDA acknowledge that Bard mesh and its various cousins may not be the best treatment option related to the aforementioned issues. The agency, however, appears unwilling to formally revoke approval of the mesh products, including Bard Avaulta mesh, for that indication. For some patients, the mesh has affected intimacy with a spouse or partner. Ironically, with some patients for whom the Avaulta pelvic mesh was intended to resolve incontinence problems, symptoms of incontinence persisted.
