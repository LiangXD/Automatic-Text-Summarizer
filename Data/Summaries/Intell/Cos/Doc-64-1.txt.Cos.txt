Under the stabilisation plan the Finance Ministry would issue $50 million of 18-month T-notes , which will be bought out by Bulbank , Bulgaria's biggest and most stable state-owned bank. The operation would also involve a buy-back of $50 million worth of dollar-denominated domestic bad debt ( ZUNK ) bonds from the Biochim Bank's portfolio by the ministry. The Bank Consolidation Company , which manages state equity in local commercial banks , holds over 98 percent of Biochim Bank's share capital. Under a funding agreement with the International Monetary Fund sealed two weeks ago Bulgaria is to act immediately to stabilise Biochim Bank and other state banks before the IMF board meeting in the second week of April is expected to approve a $510 million stand-by facility. Stabilising state banks by boosting their capital prior_to introduction of a restrictive monetary mechanism is seen as an alternative to new bank closures by the caretaker cabinet.
