Shevardnadze had said last week that the peacekeepers would have to leave if Russia did not give Georgia , devastated by civil and ethnic conflict since it became independent in 1991 , more help in restoring control over Abkhazia. The speaker of the Abkhaz parliament , Sokrat Dzhindzholia , told Interfax news agency the move was _ adopted without taking into account Abkhazia's opinion , one-sided and repressive. _ Comments: i don't want to mark this sentence as important, but it is needed as it provides the referent for Dzhindzholia in other marked sentences. Dzhindzholia said Abkhazia would not allow the so-called _ security zone _ which is under the peacekeepers' control to be extended. Shevardnadze said his Defence Minister , Vardiko Nadibaidze , had stayed in Moscow to work out details of the new peacekeeping mandate with Russian officials. Local Armenians and other ethnic groups in Abkhazia generally supported the Abkhaz in the conflict , when minorities feared what they called a wave of nationalism in Georgia.
