Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 Lower imports shrank the U.S. trade deficit dramatically in June , the Commerce Department said Tuesday , bolstering the impression of gradual waning in the economy's vigour. The monthly gap between exports and imports plunged 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion from a revised $10.55 billion in May as fewer new foreign-made cars and computers poured into American markets. Consumer goods exports in June were a record $5.95 billion , up $41 million from May. The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that reduces the impact of chronic merchandise trade deficits. In June , the merchandise deficit fell 13.9 percent to $14.46 billion from $16.79 billion in May. Lower imports of new cars and parts , especially from Japan and Germany , as_well_as cheaper petroleum helped shrink the merchandise trade gap. Lawrence Chimerine , executive director of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington , said trade benefited in June as the U.S. economic expansion lost some steam and dampened consumers' ardor for imports. The deficit with oil-producing OPEC countries dropped 26.9 percent in June to $1.40 billion from $1.91 billion in May.
