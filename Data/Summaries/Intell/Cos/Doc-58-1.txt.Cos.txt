CHINA : U.S. , China make gains from Gore , Gingrich visits. William Kazer BEIJING 1997-03-31 The United States and China may not be on the verge of a breakthrough in often testy ties , but both sides can claim gains from visits by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich , analysts said on Monday. Gore reassured the Chinese that Washington remained committed to an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin , telling reporters that officials from both countries were working on specific dates. Jiang used his meeting with Gingrich on Friday to note how pleased he was that more congressmen were visiting China to see first hand the importance of the Taiwan issue to Beijing. Beijing believes it was misled by Washington over the landmark 1995 visit to the U.S. by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui. Both Washington and Beijing struggled to ensure that accusations of illegal Chinese funding for the Democratic Party did not overshadow the Gore visit. The visit also underscored Washington's hopes that no one issue be allowed to dominate the Sino-U.S. relationship. _ Trade issues as_well_as human rights will all remain on the table for discussion in the future , _ said another diplomat.
