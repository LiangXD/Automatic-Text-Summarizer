BC-HEALTH-LD-CONGO HEALTH-LD-CONGO KIMBERLEY June 18 Sapa POSSIBILITY OF CONGO FEVER RECEDES: DOCTOR The Kimberley Provincial Hospital said it would probably know by Tuesday whether one of its patients had Congo Fever. A set of tests specifically for Congo fever were still outstanding. He said it was his opinion that the patient -- a woman -- was suffering from tick bite fever. Early symptoms of the disease include severe headaches, red eyes, fevers and cold chills, body pain, and vomiting. The disease can be contracted if a person is bitten by a certain tick or if a person comes into contact with the blood of a Congo Fever sufferer.
