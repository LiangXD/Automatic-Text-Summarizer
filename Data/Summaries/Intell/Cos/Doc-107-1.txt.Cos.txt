Massively-scaled global UC deployments are now supported with up to 40,000 UC users per cluster and up to 500,000 UC users per system. As noted in a newly released Siemens Enterprise Communications sponsored State of Enterprise Communications 2012 global study, 80 percent of user end-points are now outside of corporate headquarters, further affirming the trend toward distributed and mobile workforces. These enhancements are built into OpenScape UC Suite at no additional charge, and enable organizations to create faster, more seamless, collaborative experiences between their employees and outside the walls of the enterprise, improving responsiveness, time to market, and customer service.
