Stephen Weeks VLORE , Albania 1996-04-01 Shops , bars and cafes have been looted on almost every street. Vlore , once Albania's bustling second port , is now a violent wasteland with the recently installed rebel Committee for Public Salvation struggling to keep the place afloat. Link: [Comments: s1 provides the referent for s2's Vlore.] An Italian-led multinational security force is due_to be deployed in Vlore in the coming weeks to protect humanitarian supplies destined for its port. Residents of the port , where Albania declared independence from Ottoman rule in 1912 , rioted against Berisha in February , stripping police and expelling them from the town. Windows , light sockets , tiles and marble stairs have been stolen. While Laluci talks a rowdy argument among several people can be heard in a classroom. The rest of the rebel council is debating a new mayor and regional prefect. _ For two months we have had no supplies of food , equipment or medicine by land or sea. No one here has been paid , no pensions given , no money , nothing , _ said Laluci. They blame him first for letting the unregulated _ pyramid _ investment schemes flourish and then for allegedly _ punishing _ Vlore after February's popular uprising. _ Berisha lost his February confrontation with Vlore so he is using other methods now , terrorising us with criminal gangs , blocking ships from the port , agreeing with Italy that refugees must be sent back , _ said Laluci. The popularity of the Italian-led security force suffered a setback after a crowded refugee boat from Vlore collided with an Italian navy ship last week and sank. Residents and the rebel council have declared the Italians virtually personae non gratae but Laluci said other security force members would be welcome. _ The force is in our interest. Few people in Vlore are so positive about the plan. _ It_ 's a plot by Berisha and Italy.
