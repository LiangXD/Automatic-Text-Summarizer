JAKARTA (JP): Protesting Muslim students in favor of Palestinian solidarity tried to force their way into the U.S. Embassy compound on Jl. [Road] Medan Merdeka Selatan in Central Jakarta on Wednesday, prompting clashes with the police officers who tried to block them away, reports said. No immediate report of casualties was available, but the police reportedly managed to herd the students away from the embassy gate.
