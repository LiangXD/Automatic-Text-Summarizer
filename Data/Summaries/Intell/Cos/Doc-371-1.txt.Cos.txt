Angry at Vote, Commonwealth Bars Zimbabwe LONDON, March 19 - Flanked by the presidents of South Africa and Nigeria, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia today announced a yearlong suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, a group of 54 nations, mostly former British colonies. The suspension was decided by the three men, who met as a committee charged with deciding the Commomwealth's response. The move avoids an open rift between its majority members in Africa and Asia, some of which have tended to side with Mr. Mugabe, and rich, white-ruled countries like Britain, Canada and Australia, which have criticized him. Yet it adds one more voice to those labeling Mr. Mugabe a pariah and increasing pressure on him to seek reconciliation, possibly through new elections. The opprobrium spread further today when Switzerland became the latest country to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe, in view of the manipulation of the presidential elections and ongoing human rights violations, the Swiss government said. The committee has decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate effect, Mr. Howard said, reading the statement alone, apparently as a face-saving gesture to Mr. Mbeki, whose own election observers in Zimbabwe found the vote legitimate. Yet many African politicians, including Morgan Tsvangirai, the Zimbabwe opposition leader defeated in the election, had expressed doubt that the Commonwealth would take any action at all. The Commonwealth also supported moves to resolve the country's violent crisis over the seizure of white farmers' land, backing Mr. Mugabe in his commitment to redistribute territory among landless black Zimbabweans. In the 60's, white-ruled South Africa quit the Commonwealth rather than be suspended over apartheid; Nigeria was suspended in the 1990's during military rule because of the execution of the human rights activist Ken Saro Wiwa.
