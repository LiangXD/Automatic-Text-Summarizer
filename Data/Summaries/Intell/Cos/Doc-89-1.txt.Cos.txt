Link: [Comments: the also means that s1 is needed to make complete sense of s2.] _ We announced in December that we were going to aggressively seek a joint venture partnership or other strategic alliance and we are actively persuing that , _ said Chuck Rice , a spokesman at the company's Ashland , Kentucky head office. A report published last Thursday by Oil Price Information Service , an oil industry publication , said that an _ imminent _ deal would give Marathon 52 percent of Ashland's three U.S. refineries and retail network. _ We_ 've been linked with several companies _ since the December announcement , Rice noted. Among those previously rumored are Amoco Corp and BP America , both companies which have a major presence in the middle of the U.S. where Ashland is concentrated. Ashland , after appointing CS First Boston advisor last December , said earlier this month that it is seeking an initial public offering ( IPO ) of 3.1 million shares in its exploration unit , Blazer Energy Inc. Ashland's chemical business , which had operating income of $169 million in 1996 and is the company's fastest growing sector , continued to make acquisitions in the first quarter. Despite the company's efforts , however , its shares have performed badly since early December , dropping by about 15 percent to $40_3/8 on Friday and trailing the Dow Jones Inustrial average by the same amount over the period. $-- ( ( New York Energy Desk , +1_212_859 1623 ) )
