It was the first time Hashimoto had formally confirmed he would submit a bill to parliament revising the land expropriation laws , an issue which has become the most pressing domestic headache for his government. The new legislation will , in effect , give the Japanese government a temporary extension of its leases on land occupied by the U.S. bases after the current contracts expire. Hashimoto faces a May 14 deadline on the leases on land owned by some 3,000 people on Japan's southern Okinawa island , who are refusing to renew the contracts. Without the proposed revisions to the land laws , the government would be _ illegally _ occupying the land. Local authorities on Okinawa , where about half of the 40,000 U.S. troops in Japan are stationed , want the bases closed by 2015 but Tokyo strongly opposes such a move. The row between the central and Okinawan governments over U.S. bases flared up in September 1995 when three U.S. servicemen were arrested for the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl.
