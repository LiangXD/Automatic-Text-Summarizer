MMM F_NAME L_NAME TITLE COMPANY ADDRESS CITY,ST ZIP March 4, 1999 Dear LTR_NAME: CCI has come a long way in the last five years. We've worked hard to structrue the organization so that we've ready to move boldly into the next century, and I believe that we have an exciting and successful future ahead of us. The community initiatives committee is working with our development office to put together a long-range fundraising plan that will ultimately bring more money into our centers. I also encourage you to seek additional support through your company, church, or service organization. Your financial support of the development process is just one step in making CCI a stronger, more efficient and ultimately more effective federation of service providers.
