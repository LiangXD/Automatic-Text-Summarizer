Assistant Commissioner David Veness, head of Scotland Yard's specialist operations, said: New information, combined with the relentless efforts of scientific experts, our detailed knowledge of the ship and its movements, and very careful examination of the vessel over the last three days leads us to be completely satisfied that the Nisha is not a suspicious vessel and does not pose a danger. The ship had sailed from Mauritius and was carrying a cargo of sugar to the Tate &amp;amp; Lyle refinery on the Thames at Silvertown in east London, according to the company. Thankfully, the ship has been proved not to pose a danger to the public. Mr Veness praised the crew and ship's owners for their co-operation and said: We remain vigilant and are totally committed to ensuring the safety of the public. The chairman of the British arm of the Great Eastern Shipping Company, Sudhir Mulji, confirmed that the vessel had stopped over at Djibouti before its current journey to drop off American grain as part of a food aid shipment. The ship then went on to Mauritius to pick up the sugar and left on November 20 to transport it to Britain. The Great Eastern Shipping Company, which has offices in India, London, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, is a leading Indian shipping and offshore service provider with a fleet of 38 cargo-carrying vessels.
