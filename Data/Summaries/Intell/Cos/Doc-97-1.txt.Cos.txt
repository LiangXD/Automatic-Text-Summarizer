David Lawder DETROIT 1997-03-31 Continuing at a steady but unspectacular pace , U.S. car and truck sales for March are expected to show gains for Japanese and German automakers at the expense of Detroit's Big Three , analysts said Monday. Analysts said Japanese automakers are expected to continue increasing sales and market share , based on a hot portfolio of new products coupled with a weak Japanese yen that allows them to price more aggressively. _ It still sounds pretty sloppy. As the year drags on , automakers will probably have to fork over increasingly higher incentives to maintain sales rates above 15 million , Casesa said. The Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase in interest rates last week is not expected to have an immediate effect on vehicle sales , analysts said. _ Another round or two of what we saw could lead to slightly less income growth , _ said independent auto analyst Scott Merlis. He added that increases in adjustable rate mortgage payments and credit card interest reduce consumers' ability to make new car payments. CS First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas said Chrysler's sluggish passenger car sales are _ troublesome , _ given the company's increased dealer incentive spending in the first quarter. _ They do not appear to have had much impact on March sales , _ he said in a research report. But GM's improved sales are not expected to be enough to offset the market share gains by Toyota Motor Corp. , Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and other Japanese automakers , particular in the intermediate passenger car market.
