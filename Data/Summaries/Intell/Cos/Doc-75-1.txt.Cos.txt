NEW YORK 1997-03-31 WHX Corp said Monday it began a cash tender offer for $40 a common share of Dynamics Corp of America. When added to its current holding of 109,600 shares , a 2.9 percent stake , the shares would equal 19.9 percent of Dynamic's outstanding common stock , it said. WHX said that if Dynamics amends its _ poison pill _ anti-takeover defense trigger to below 20 percent , then the percentage to be bought in its offer would be automatically reduced by a commensurate amount. WHX , a holding company whose principal unit is Wheeling , Pittsburgh Steel Corp , said that late last week it sent a letter to Dynamics proposing a cash merger at $40 a share , giving the merger deal a value of about $160 million. In its proposal , WHX said it was prepared to raise its offer if additional information that Dynamics may provide proves that a higher price was warranted. Greenwich , Conn. , $- based Dynamics is a maker of electronic components , mobile vans and transportable shelters for specialized electronic and medical diagnostic equipment.
