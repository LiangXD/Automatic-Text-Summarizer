Since the United States switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, ROC Representative to the United States Chen Chien-jen said substantive Taiwan-U.S. relations have never been as close as they are at the present time. Chen made the remarks at a luncheon given by himself in honor of directors and supervisors of the World Federation of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce (WFTCC), who were meeting in Las Vegas. Noting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chen said Taiwan and mainland China will be able to engage in constructive interactions under the WTO framework. Chen said he admires all Taiwan businesspeople's patriotism and contribution to Taiwan's and their resident countries' economic development over the years.
