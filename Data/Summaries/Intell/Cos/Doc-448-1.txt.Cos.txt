November 27, 1995 Dear Friend: What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run Children's Homes? Young adults, like Mary T., a jobless mother of three, trying desperately to keep her kids out of trouble in a crime-ridden neighborhood. Kids like Tommie J., made a ward of the court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father; Alice, sent to a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders; and John H., a recovering alcoholic, rebuilding a relationships with his family so they can live together again. Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil War. Today, we serve children and families with a multitude of problems: emotional, physical, psychological and sexual abuse. In 1995 we will serve over 850 children and 340 families. For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families, we need your support. Your gift will give children and families hope for improved tomorrows.
