May 23 (Interfax) - The Russian Aerospace Agency is continuing its active search for a space tourist candidate who would fly to the International Space Station (ISS) in autumn, agency director Yuri Koptev told Interfax on Thursday. At a joint news conference in Moscow this month, Interfax was told that both Americans are expected to announce intentions to fly to space. However, the Russian Aerospace Agency told Interfax that it has not received any official applications from either the Americans or the Russian pop group. At the moment, the probability of the third space tourist making a space flight this year is 70-80%, informed sources told Interfax on Thursday.
