SAN FRANCISCO 1996-08-20 Levi Strauss & Co. said Tuesday it was launching a line of slacks meant to appeal to men who do_ n't like suits , in only the third major brand introduction in the company's 140-year history. The new slacks , to be called Slates , will be marketed as dressier than the company's famous jeans or its Dockers pants brand , but not as formal as suits. The pants will come in flannel , wool gabardine and other fabrics with a suggested retail price of $50 to $90 a pair , said Lory Cogan , Levi vice president for marketing. Cogan said research revealed that men hate to shop for dress pants and believe _ it_ 's more enjoyable to go to the dentist _ because they ca_ n't find what they need or like. He said that Levi Strauss is trying to expand its business by going after the $1.9 billion-a-year market , but he does_ n't see it as a _ great growth engine _ for the company.
