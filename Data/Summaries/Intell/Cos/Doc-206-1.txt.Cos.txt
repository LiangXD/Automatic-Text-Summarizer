The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has been strongly criticized and condemned by many countries. Recently, the Information Office of the Chinese People's Congress released a report on human rights in the United States in 2001, criticizing violations of human rights there. The report quoting data from the Christian Science Monitor, points out that the murder rate in the United States is 5.5 per 100,000 people. In light of the United States' malicious goals, its Annual Human Rights Report for 2001 is facing strong protest and criticism from the world. Many Americans have given evidence to prove the wrong judgment of their administration against human rights in other countries, especially in Vietnam. The Washington Times last weekend carried an article by Andrew Welsdan, a representative of the US Fund for Reconciliation and Development, rejecting the report's allegation of human rights in Vietnam. The Annual Human Rights Report released by the US State Department is not convincing as it is inaccurate and fabricated.
