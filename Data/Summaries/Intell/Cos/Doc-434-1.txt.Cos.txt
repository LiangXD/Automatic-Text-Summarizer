August 10, 1999 Mr. Caring Philanthropy 01234 Giving Way Contribution, USA 56789 Dear Mr. Philanthropy, The urgency you feel to make changes is just the extent that change will be made. Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full of hope and with a positive outlook. Thanks to our Big Sisters volunteers, these young people are self-confident, believe in themselves and are beginning to realize their full potential. A recent study bypositive Public/Private Ventures (PPV) showed that girls who had a Big Sister for just one year: reduced first-time drug use by 46% lowered school absenteeism by 52% cut violent behavior by 33% enhanced school performance showed improved peer and family relationships Former Little Sister Amy, now 18-years old, is a testament to the Big Sisters program. Since then, she and I have grown very close and I have been able to experience lots of new things. Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister, but I learned a lot from her too. In 1998, Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many programs. Will you make a financial gift to Big Sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the guidance they need, that more young people stay in school, stay off drugs and make good choices? If you would like to find out more about the Big Sisters program, please call us, (317) 634-6102 and ask for Ellen Robinson. Sincerely, Andrew T. Burns Patron Relations Chairperson P.S.
