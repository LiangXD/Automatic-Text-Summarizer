Dr Eric Edwards of the Shellfish Association says : & bquo ; Customer reaction is that they are stylish and upmarket. & equo ; Demand in Europe and North America continues to rise by 4 per_cent a year $- despite the fact that natural sources are already overfished. But while rising demand , high prices and fast growth provide the stimulus , the prawn '_ s life-cycle presents many problems for the would-be farmer. A team of scientists from the distinctly untropical environment of the University College of North Wales in Bangor has solved some of these problems by designing food fit for a prawn to eat. Ideally , farmers would like to grow the larvae from eggs , and so a new industry ? prawn hatcheries ? has grown up_to meet the demand. In the past , hatcheries have had to rely on live feed , which is as unreliable and expensive to harvest from nature as it is to grow artificially. A team led by Dr David Jones , of Bangor '_ s renowned School of Ocean Sciences , designed a revolutionary new feed , using a process called microencapsulation which puts a thin , digestible membrane around each tiny food particle. & bquo ; It '_ s exactly the same , essentially , as making nylon , & equo ; he says. & bquo ; To do that , you take a_lot_of identical molecules called amines and join them together to form a chain. But it soon became obvious that the proteins of the nutrient contained the correct chemical groups , and that the food molecules themselves were polymerizing and creating the capsule membrane. & bquo ; Haemoglobin , chicken egg and many other natural proteins are rich in the important chemical groups , and these cross-link without any problem at all. The first membranes they made were far too thin and would not survive transfer into air , let_alone freeze-drying. & bquo ; Once we had solved the thickness problem , it became a commercial possibility , & equo ; says Dr Jones , & bquo ; and Mars ? the people who make the chocolate bars ? became interested. Developing the diet has had great scientific spin-offs. & bquo ; It '_ s amazing that a multi-million pound industry was built on an animal nobody knew anything about , & equo ; Dr Jones says. & bquo ; We have 50 years of data on the chicken or the pig. None of this had been done for the prawn. & bquo ; Through refining our feed , by leaving things out and seeing what happens , we have been able to define the dietary requirements of the prawn throughout its development. We '_ ve learnt about its physiology and how it changes to keep pace with the larva '_ s changing eating habits. & bquo ; We know how fast food moves through its gut , how much energy it takes to make one post-larval prawn from the day it hatches , and_so_on. We '_ ve learnt an enormous amount because the microcapsule is such an ideal tool for simplifying and controlling food intake. & equo ; Dr Jones and his team are now extending their work to other species , and to the post-larval stage , which leads to the ultimate product ? the prawn on the end of your fork. And expertise gained has enabled the university to launch a new MSc course in shellfish biology , fisheries and culture ? due_to take its first students in the coming academic year. & bquo ; The commercial aspects are very good , of_course ? though I still find the teaching and research spin-offs the most exciting part of it all , & equo ; says Dr Jones. But Dr Jones '_ s involvement with industry has led him into difficulties ? which lend a critical edge to the parable. & bquo ; Frippak support our work generously , & equo ; he says. & bquo ; But they are understandably reluctant to pay for research students , because they will probably go off and join the competition. The project '_ s got alpha ratings , but the council saw the industrial involvement and said & bquo ; Go to industry ? we '_ re short_of money & equo ;. & bquo ; It '_ s a real Catch 22 situation.
