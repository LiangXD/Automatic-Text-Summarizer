A short time later, the Community Youth Mapping Project sent 55 young people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow up well: caring adults, safe places to go, and positive things to do. As a provider of youth services, MCCOY, Inc. is here to support your valuable efforts to develop young people. Recently, through a lot of hard work and alliances with organizations like yours, some steps have been taken in our community that will help young people continue to be involved in positive activities. Two, funding was made available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct positive youth programming on Saturday evenings. Annually, we ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis.
