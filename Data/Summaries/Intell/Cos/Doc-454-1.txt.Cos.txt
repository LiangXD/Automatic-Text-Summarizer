Shanghai, May 9 (XINHUA)-- The spreading AIDS epidemic is threatening Asia's economic growth, warned officials from the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization and bank delegates at Investing in Asia's Health , an Asian Development Bank (ADB) seminar held here Thursday. AIDS is casting shadow on Asia's economic miracle, and is turning into a global crisis, as the region accounts for 60 percent of world's population, says Michel Sidibe, Director of the Country and Regional Support Department of UNAIDS. Jeffrey Sachs, director for the Center for International Development at Harvard University and chairman of the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, believes developing countries should fully recognize the importance of investing in health in their overall development strategy. In his report, Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development , released by the WHO last December, Sachs estimated that total annual health outlays in world's least- developed countries would rise by 17 billion U.S. dollars by 2007 and 29 billion U.S. dollars by 2015 and AIDS prevention and care would account for half the increase.
