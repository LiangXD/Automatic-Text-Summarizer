His remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar after Northern Alliance troops finally entered Kunduz. British troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was better than anybody could have hoped for , according to Mr Cook. The city's top Taliban commander was among thousands of Afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting. The surrender took days to hammer out, primarily because hard core Taliban and foreign troops from Usama Bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida terror network did not want to give up. The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold following the rapid collapse of their regime across the majority of the country. Ruud Lubbers, the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, said Afghanistan was not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in and not enough food had been taken into the country. So although our international staff went back to Kabul and hope to go back to the other places... one cannot say it is safe in the country and secure enough. The campaign so far showed Alliance military success was the best way of getting food in, he said. He again stressed that Britain would need to see evidence before it became involved in military action in other countries.
