Marshall Schwarz was named chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Trust Corp., a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $17 billion. Mr. Schwarz, 52 years old, will succeed Daniel P. Davison Feb. Mr. Schwarz, who is president of U.S. Trust will be succeeded in that post by Jeffrey S. Maurer, 42, who is executive vice president in charge of the company's asset-management group. We have always taken smaller accounts, but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow, Mr. Schwarz says. The new services allow U.S. Trust to cater to the new wealth, Mr. Schwarz says. We will have a reasonably flat year this year, Mr. Schwarz says. Mr. Schwarz also said costs associated with U.S. Trust's planned move to midtown Manhattan from Wall Street will continue to be a drag on earnings through 1990. Mr. Schwarz's great-grandfather founded the New York toy store F.A.O. Schwarz but his family no longer has ties to the company. Mr. Schwarz's father was a U.S. Trust trustee until 1974. Donald M. Roberts, 54, treasurer, and Frederick S. Wonham, 58, who takes responsibility for the funds-service group, were named vice chairmen and will serve in the office of the chairman. Frederick B. Taylor, 48, also was named a vice chairman and chief investment officer, a new post.
