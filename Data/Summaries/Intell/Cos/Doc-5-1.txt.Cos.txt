Helen Smith LONDON 1996-08-20 In a theatre open to London's often rainy skies , a troupe of actors begins a risky experiment on Wednesday to discover what William Shakespeare's plays were like when first peformed 400 years ago. The Globe Theatre is a replica of the 20-sided wood-and-thatch arena which Shakespeare part-owned and where his finest works , including _ Macbeth , _ _ Hamlet _ and _ King Lear _ , were staged during his lifetime. Wanamaker had waged a 40-year battle against bureacracy and commercial greed to get the new Globe built just yards ( metres ) from the site of the original on the south bank of the Thames , opposite St Paul's Cathedral. His vision is still central to the 30 million pound ( $46 million ) Globe , which begins a _ prologue season _ on Wednesday with a production of _ Two Gentlemen of Verona. _ _ Anyone who worked with Sam was very much influenced by what he wanted to put together , _ said Lennie James , who plays one of the _ Two Gentlemen. _ Interviewed under grey skies in the Globe's auditorium on Tuesday , James said the place feels permeated with a sense of history. _ When ( artistic director Mark Rylance ) first welcomed us onto the stage saying we were the first actors in 400 years to stand here , I got a real buzz , _ he said. The actors had little time to learn their roles and would not have seen the full script , which was kept carefully guarded for fear that it would be stolen by another theatre. The cast of _ Two Gentlemen of Verona _ will include women and black actors , both unheard of in Shakespeare's day , and the play is set in modern Italy.
