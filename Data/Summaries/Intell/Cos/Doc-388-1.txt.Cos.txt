Jordan to sign Kyoto Protocol AMMAN - Jordan said it will sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact on impeding global greenhouse gas emissions, following a recent Cabinet decision, according to Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP). Soon, the government will delegate Jordan's representative to the United Nations, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, to sign the protocol, Juneidi told The Jordan Times on Tuesday, adding that an exact date for signing of the environmental agreement had not been set. In 1997, at a UN conference in Kyoto, Japan, the Kyoto Protocol legally obliged developed countries to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent (below 1990 levels) between 2008 and 2012.
