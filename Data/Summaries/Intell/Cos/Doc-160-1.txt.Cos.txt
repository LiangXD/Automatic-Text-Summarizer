It will discuss the bills on euthanasia and palliative care that the Senate approved in the autumn of 2001. The Chamber will treat the bill differently than the Senate, which worked with a joint justice and public health committee. Moreover, the Chamber's justice committee seems to want to go it alone regarding the euthanasia debate. This committee is scheduled to start the debate on the Senate's euthanasia bill today. VLD Floor Leader Hugo Coveliers and party member Maggie De Block also have a bill on euthanasia.
