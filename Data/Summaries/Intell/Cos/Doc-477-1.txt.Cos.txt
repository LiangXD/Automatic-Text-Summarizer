Buenos Aires, 22 April (Telam) -- Justicialist Deputy Jose Manuel Diaz Bancalari said today that the IMF is seeking to create an uncontrollable social situation with the demands it has made of the government and, on the other hand, he confirmed the PJ [Justicialist Party] bloc's willingness to support approval of the draft law on bonds submitted by the executive branch. It seems as if they are seeking to create an uncontrollable social situation, the legislator stated this morning, referring to the demands presented by the IMF to the country for reaching a new agreement that would bring in foreign financing for the government's accounts. All the governments are saying that Argentina has to make arrangements first with the IMF before receiving any kind of aid, and they know perfectly well that they are asking us to put 450,000 fellow citizens out of work, and that is only possible with a military government, he asserted. The deputy stressed the value of the bonds the government will issue for the depositors, asking who would want certificates of deposit in bankrupt banks and saying that instead, however we move forward into the future, there will always be the state's legal continuity backing the obligation.
