STRASBOURG, Nov 29 (AFP) -- Three leading international organisations warned jointly Thursday [29 November] that the international fight against terrorism should not be a pretext for the violation of human rights. While we recognize that the threat of terrorism requires specific measures, we call on all governments to refrain from any excessive steps which would violate fundamental freedoms and undermine legitimate dissent, a joint statement issued in Strasbourg, Geneva and Warsaw said. The statement listed what it said were essential rights that could not be hollowed out because of the fight against terrorism.
