Pat LaCrosse asked me to send this information inviting you to join the Georgia O'Keeffe Circle of the Indianapolis Museum of Art's Second Century Society (SCS). These are particularly exciting times at the Indianapolis Museum of Art: Progress continues on the J.K. Lilly estate-Oldfields, our Ravine Garden has been restored to its original splendor, and there is national attention showered on our current exhibition of Japanese Painting. In joining SCS, you join the ranks of those who believe that bringing art and art education to the city makes life better, richer, and more rewarding for the entire community. Sincerely, ARLETTA B.NEWTON Donor Relations Coordinator Enclosures/ P.S. Both our Barefoot in the Grass family picnic (July 23,2000) and the annual SCS Founders Day celebration (October 11,2000) are free for Georgia O'Keeffe members.
