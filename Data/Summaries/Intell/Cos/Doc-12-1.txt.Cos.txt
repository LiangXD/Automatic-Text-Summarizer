Mark Wallace NEW YORK 1996-08-20 Consumer Reports magazine slapped a _ Not Acceptable _ label on two sport/utility vehicles Tuesday , saying the light trucks _ have too great a tendency to roll over in certain situations. _ The magazine said the 1995 and 1996 models of the Isuzu Trooper , made by Isuzu Motors Ltd. , and the 1996 Acura SLX , also made by Isuzu but sold by Honda Motor Co. Ltd. , were a danger to consumers because they _ tipped up high on two wheels _ in road tests. But Smith Barney analyst David Garrity said the report by the influential magazine could prove damaging. _ If Consumer Reports comes out and says , '_ Do_ n't buy this product , _' the sales will go down , _ Garrity said. _ You saw what happened to the Suzuki Samurai in the '80s._ The tiny Suzuki Samurai , introduced in the mid-1980s , was also the target of a Consumer Reports article alleging that the sport/utility vehicle was prone to rollovers. Consumer Reports also asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate the Trooper and SLX and called for more stringent government oversight of vehicles with narrow wheelbases. Neither McCue nor Acura spokesman Mike Spencer knew of any reports from customers of their vehicles tipping or rolling over , and neither knew of any ongoing NHTSA investigation. _ We have not had an opportunity to thoroughly review the testing methodology used.
