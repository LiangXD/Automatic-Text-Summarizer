During the workshop, organised by the Union of Arab Banks (UAB), participants will also review legislation Arab countries have introduced to combat this phenomenon as well as the ways and means by which money is laundered. Our institutions are far away from this money laundering phenomenon and Arab governments have amended banking laws to combat money laundering, Shakir said. Jordan was among the Arab countries which introduced measures to fight this problem including tightening banking rules and imposing strict controls on money transfers. Money launderers target countries with low risk of detection, soft tax systems and lenient banking regulations, Shakir said. He said, according to international agencies which combat this phenomenon, statistically the United States ranks first in term of destination, origin and flows of laundered money.
