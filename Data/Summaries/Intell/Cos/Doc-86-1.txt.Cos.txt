Jim Loney MIAMI 1997-03-31 Linda Finch , the Texas businesswoman and aviator who is retracing the flight of the legendary Amelia Earhart 60 years ago , took off on Monday on the first over-water leg of her round-the-world journey. Link: [Comments: s1 provides the referent for Finch , Earhart ] Link: [Comments: s1 provides the referent for Finch , Earhart ] A highly polished , 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E , the same model used by Earhart in 1937 , carried Finch and navigator Bob Fodge into a cloudy Miami sky enroute to Puerto Rico. The plane , one of only two remaining , was painstakingly restored for _ World Flight 1997 , _ a $4.5-million project to visit five continents and 20 countries on a 30,000-mile ( 48,000 km ) route similar to that taken by Earhart. _ We_ 're finally ready to leave. Trailed by a blue Grumman amphibious plane that will act as her safety net , Finch left Miami after a week of meetings with schoolchildren , preparations on the Electra and a_bit_of fishing , as Earhart is said to have done six decades ago. Finch , who early on Monday helped stow luggage aboard the plane and joined a horde of helpers to push it from a hangar , said she had been consumed with final flight details. _ I think Amelia was probably the same way. You really get focused on the details of making the flight and the plane and what it needs as you_ 're flying , _ Finch said. _ I think Amelia's journey was much harder without fax machines and telephones to arrange for fuel and oil and landing permits , _ she said. _ It must have been difficult. _ Finch's aides say the pilot is reluctant to compare her flight to Earhart's , believing the message of the pioneering aviator's cause was lost in the mystery of her disappearance. Jane Logman of the Netherlands , the wife of a pilot , said Finch was a role model to her 15-year-old daughter , who had just begun pilot training. _ I would like my daughter to do the same ( as Finch ) , _ Logman said. _ She_ 's an inspiration and especially because she_ 's a woman. _ World Flight is sponsored by Pratt & Whitney , a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp , which distributed a free educational program to schools throughout the United States.
