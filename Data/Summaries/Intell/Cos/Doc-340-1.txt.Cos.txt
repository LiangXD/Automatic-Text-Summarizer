Russia disagrees with 'axis' remark MUNICH, Germany -- Russia's defense minister said Sunday that his country disagrees with the U.S. view of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil." President Bush described Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil" during his State of the Union address on Jan. China's official Xinhua news agency also weighed in Sunday on Bush's choice of words, accusing the president of orchestrating public opinion in advance of possible strikes against the three countries in an expansion of the war against terrorism. Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino, meanwhile, said Sunday that his country would not support an attack on Iraq without "proven proof" that Baghdad is supporting al Qaeda, and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein dispatched a delegation to meet with European Union leaders in Spain. Ivanov said the West uses a double standard in its definition of terrorism, asking why members of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network are terrorists, but not Chechen separatists fighting Russia. His remarks came on the last day of the Munich Conference on Security, an invitation-only gathering of 400 international leaders who this year debated the war on terrorism. Sunday's final session also underscored the vast differences between the United States and Russia.
