1996-08-20 Kansas and Arizona filed lawsuits against some of the biggest tobacco firms Tuesday , joining a growing list of states seeking to recover hundreds of millions of dollars for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. Meanwhile , aides to Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley said he would file a suit against tobacco companies on Wednesday while legal sources said Oklahoma would file suit Thursday. In Indianapolis , meanwhile , another liability challenge to the tobacco industry headed toward a decision. Also on Tuesday , New York City's public advocate urged Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to sue the tobacco industry to recover what the city paid out for health care costs of smokers. Public Advocate Mark Green said the city should join the group of states and the city of San Francisco in their efforts to obtain Medicaid refunds from cigarette companies. In that case the jury said the Lucky Strikes he smoked were a defective product and that cigarette maker Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , a unit of Britain's B.A.T. Industries Plc , was negligent by failing to inform the public about the health risks of smoking. Stovall said the Kansas lawsuit suit was the broadest to date because it sought to force tobacco firms to pay for programs aimed at educating children about the hazards of smoking.
