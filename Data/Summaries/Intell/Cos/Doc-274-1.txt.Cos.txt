Orkem S.A., a French state-controlled chemical manufacturer, is making a friendly bid of 470 pence ($7.43) a share for the 59.2% of U.K. specialty chemical group Coates Brothers PLC which it doesn't already own, the two sides said. Orkem and Coates said last Wednesday that the two were considering a merger, through Orkem's British subsidiary, Orkem Coatings U.K. Ltd.
