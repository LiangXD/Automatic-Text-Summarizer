Ground controllers took over manual control and, a few hours later, were able to latch the railcar to the track. Space station astronaut Carl Walz sent another computer command from inside to get the railcar moving again. The railcar smoothly rolled 26 feet to a second work station, where the same thing happened. Later Monday, Walz commanded the railcar to move for the third and final time, back down the same 26 feet of track. There is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track because of rings on both ends of the 44-foot girder, Sellari said. The railcar is needed to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm from one end of the outpost to the other as more girders are installed.
