Britain's Prescott Pushes for Kyoto Pact Backing VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- The Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be ratified even without U.S. support, British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told an international conference on business and the environment on Friday. Prescott, Britain's front man in pushing the accord, said the United States until recently was critical of the science that led to the Kyoto pact but has now accepted it, and he remains optimistic that the goals of the United States and of other signatory nations would converge. The Kyoto Protocol calls on countries to reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are blamed by many scientists for global warming, to pre-1990 levels by 2012. The issue has pitted business groups, who claim the accord will hurt the global economy, against environmentalists, who warn of the dire effects from global warming such as higher ocean levels and destruction of various plants and animal species. Canada's Environmental Minister, David Anderson, is under pressure from the country's energy producers to follow the U.S. position. Prescott came to Anderson's support on Friday, agreeing that financial figures quoted by Kyoto opponents in Canada about the potential damage to the Canadian economy were pure fiction.
