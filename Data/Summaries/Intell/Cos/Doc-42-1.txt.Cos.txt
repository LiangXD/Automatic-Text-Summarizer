Risa Maeda TOKYO 1997-03-31 The Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) may continue to let Japanese short-term money rates to fluctuate widely after April 1 to remind the market of the risk of relying too much on overnight money , analysts said on Monday. That is partly because the central bank seems more likely to keep the upward bias in the key overnight rate than before , given BOJ governor Yasuo Matsushita's remarks last week. The BOJ also needs to encourage the financial institutions to reduce their reliance on overnight money prior_to its introduction of the _ real-time gross settlement _ ( RTGS ) system , they said. For_example , analysts said , a sudden rise to 0.58 percent in the key overnight call rate on March 24 , when many banks suffered from paying more than they expected , was seen as planned. The BOJ has said the financial firms' efforts to reduce reliance on overnight call money and do more longer-term transactions is necessary for an introduction of the RTGS. But once any defaults , all transactions would need to be halted , paralysing the entire system. _ Once banks do have concerns about liquidity risk , they should raise more longer-term funds.
