SHUTTLEWORTH-MBEKI by Mariette le Roux BLOEMFONTEIN April 27 Sapa MBEKI SPEAKS TO 'AFRONAUT' IN OUTER SPACE Contact was made on Saturday between outer space and the Free State city of Bloemfontein when President Thabo Mbeki spoke to Africa's first astronaut Mark Shuttleworth, aboard the International Space Station. I have never seen anything as beautiful as earth from space. I am sure the American food will be just as good, Shuttleworth told the president. Mbeki expressed South Africa's pride at Shuttleworth's efforts, saying they would go a long way towards inspiring young people to take up subjects like engineering, mathematics and science. Shuttleworth also expressed his condolences to the family and friends of Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete, who died on Friday night, a message Mbeki undertook to convey. The president then toasted Shuttleworth with a glass of champagne, saying: I am sure this will go down in our history as one of those moments where we made quite a leap forward. The world's second space tourist, Shuttleworth was paying 20 million dollars for his 10-day journey into space, where he would carry out experiments into the HI virus which causes AIDS.
