During arrests and detentions, security force members reportedly tortured and beat citizens who were suspected of complicity with Unita, the report says. According to the rights report, most of the abuses were perpetrated by Special Field Force (SFF) members. The report charged that many people were arrested on the basis of suspicious links with Angolan rebel movement, Unita, and the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA). Shivute said Namibia attached little value to the latest US rights report as it carried a lot of factual inaccuracies and was a mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports. Shivute also said the report carried a total confusion of historical data by claiming that the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW) was no longer affiliated to the Swapo Party.
