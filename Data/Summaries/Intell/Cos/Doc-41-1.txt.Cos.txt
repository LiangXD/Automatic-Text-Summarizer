Yoo Choon-sik SEOUL 1997-03-31 South Korea on Monday raised the ceiling for foreign share-ownership by three percentage points , but analysts said they saw little short-term impact on the local stock market because_of poor fundamentals. Analysts said the country's growing current account deficit and the resulting depreciation of the won are the main factors discouraging foreign investment in local stocks. Namuh Rhee , head of research at Dongbang Peregrine Securities , also played down the likely impact of the expanded ownership ceiling. _ Most of the rebound we saw in the past couple of days reflected the expected increase in the foreign investment limit. The expansion of the ceiling was in line with South Korea's earlier plan that called for a three-percentage-point increase by the end of this year. Analysts said Samsung Electronics Co , SK Telecom Co , Pohang Iron and Steel Co , Kookmin Bank and Shinhan Bank would benefit most from the increased ceiling. _ Foreigners are paying premiums over the counter for these shares , _ said Rhee. The aggregate foreign ownership ceiling on _ strategically important _ Pohang Iron and Korea Electric Power Corp will be raised to 18 percent from the current 15 percent. At the end of February , foreigners held 989.12 million shares , or 11.43 percent of total listed local shares , according_to the Securities Supervisory Board.
