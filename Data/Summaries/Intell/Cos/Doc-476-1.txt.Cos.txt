Bangkok, 09 April Kyodo -- Thailand expects China's official response to its proposal for a free-trade agreement Friday when Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra meets Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on the sidelines of a regional economic conference, local dailies said Tuesday. Thaksin will leave Thailand on Thursday to visit Hainan Island in southern China to attend the first meeting of the two-day Boao Forum for Asia, which starts Friday. Boontipa, head of the ministry's Department of Business Economics, said the time frame of the bilateral free-trade area would be shorter than the 10-year time frame envisaged for a free-trade area between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Thailand is a member.
