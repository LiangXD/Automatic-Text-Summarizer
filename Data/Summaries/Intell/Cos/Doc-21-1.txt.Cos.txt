SAO PAULO 1997-03-31 Double world champion Michael Schumacher learned on Sunday that his season was again going to be a struggle $-- thanks_to the Formula One tyre war. Schumacher had hoped to lead his Italian team on a championship challenge this year and he made it clear he felt his bid had been undermined by his car's Goodyear tyres , while rivals like Frenchman Olivier Panis and reigning champion Damon Hill were making the most of the new Bridgestone rubber. Panis , fifth in the first race of the season in Australia , finished third to score the Prost team and Bridgestone's first podium finish , while Hill , after running as high as fourth in a car which was abysmal in Melbourne , eventually retired with a blown Yamaha engine. _ The tyres were fantastic , _ Panis said. _ It will not be long_before we can win a race with them. _ Hill's team also praised the Bridgestone tyres. Team manager John Walton said : _ I think we could have gone the distance with these tyres and scored a good finish if it had not been for other problems. _ Villeneuve's victory , however , proved that the Canadian had the ability to produce strong racing even when things were tough and he was not running on the best tyres. It was his first victory of the season and the fifth of his career and put him level top of the drivers' championship after two of this year's 17 races.
