COLOMBO, Sept 16 (AFP) - Tamil Tiger rebels launched a flotilla of boats to attack a ferry carrying 1,200 troops in northern Sri Lanka Sunday, hours after an explosive-laden boat tried to ram a navy gunboat in a suicide mission, the defence ministry said. A cluster of at least 20 boats of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) mounted the pre-dawn attack on the MV Pride of South off the island's Point Pedro coast, ministry spokesman Sanath Karunaratne said. He said navy gunboats and helicopter gunships repulsed the initial attack and first reports indicated at least two rebel craft had been blown out of the water. Hours before the ferry incident, a navy fast attack craft encountered an explosive-laden boat which blew up in an apparent Tamil Tiger suicide mission, Karunaratne said. All three people onboard that boat evaporated, indicating that it was packed with explosives to ram against the navy fast attack craft, Karunaratne said. The navy vessel escaped serious damage or casualties. Tiger guerrillas, leading a campaign for an independent homeland in the island's northeast, have carried out several attacks against navy and merchant ships, including using boats carrying suicide bombers on more than a dozen naval craft. In September 1999, the Sri Lankan navy fought Tiger rebel boats off the island's northeastern coast to prevent the guerrillas from seizing a Chinese merchant vessel.
