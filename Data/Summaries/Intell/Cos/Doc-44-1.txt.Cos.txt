JAKARTA 1997-03-31 Net profits posted by Indocement , a major Indonesian cement manufacturer , in 1996 are above market estimates and installation of additional production capacity in 1997 and 1998 should keep the company in good stead , analysts said. Aside_from changes in the accounting method , he also said the stable growth of the company's food division at about 15 percent per year had contributed to earnings growth. Partono said he expected Indocement's cement division to improve its performance in 1997 and 1998 due_to additional capacity from two new plants in West Java and Kalimantan. However , Partono said he expected Indocement to perform only in line with the broader market and not exceed it. _ If we break up the value of Indocement into two divisions , cement and food , the cement business is undervalued , _ he said. He added that currently it trades at a price earnings of 9.1 times its 1997 earnings compared with Semen Gresik which trades at 12 times 1997 earnings. _ So , its cement business appears to be undervalued relative to other cement companies. Partono said it was hard to make a fair valuation for Indocement because it could not be considered a pure cement stock or a pure food stock.
