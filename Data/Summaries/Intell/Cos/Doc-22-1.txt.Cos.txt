Brian Homewood RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-03-30 Botafogo won the first stage of the Rio de Janeiro championship on Sunday after a match in which the bizarre rules of the competition , rather_than rivals Vasco da Gama , appeared to be their real opponents. Botafogo won all eleven of their games in the first stage of the tournament but were then forced to decide the title in a Sunday's one-off match against Vasco , who finished the stage eight points below them in second place. The rules stated that in the first stage , the top two teams would meet in a final , no_matter_how far apart they were. Botafogo , however , overcame their sense of injustice by beating Vasco 1-0 with late headed goal by central defender Goncalves. _ In any other country in the world , Botafogo would have won without having to play this game , _ Goncalves said afterwards. Goalkeeper Vagner commented : _ After eleven straight wins , we still had to play Vasco but I think God was watching us. _ Winning the first stage guarantees Botafogo a place in the final of the tournament , where they will join the winners of the next two stages. Botafogo were among three clubs who boycotted the opening day of play because they did not like the rules at the time. On Wednesday , Botafogo , already guaranteed their place in the fianl , caused a furore when they fielded a reserve team against Flamengo , who needed to beat them to overtake Vasco and finish second.
