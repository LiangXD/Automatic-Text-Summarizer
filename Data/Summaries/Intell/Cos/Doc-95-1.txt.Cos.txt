USA : Wall St stocks slide for second straight session. Richard Melville NEW YORK 1997-03-31 Heightened concern about the outlook for interest rates sent Wall Street stocks skidding for a second straight session on Monday and dragged the Dow industrials to one of their sharpest losses ever. The slide , unofficially the sixth largest in history in point terms , came on the heels of a 140-point skid on Thursday. _ There_ 's clearly nervousness out_there right_now , _ said Philip Orlando , chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. _ We_ 've got industries like technology that have just gotten hammered , with many companies losing half their value in just the last two months , _ he added. The declines by technology issues , coupled with weak showing by health-care stocks , pulled Nasdaq down 28 points to 1222. Analysts said some of the activity bore the earmarks of portfolio window-dressing by managers leery of showing large stock holdings in the uncertain climate. _ Today was the last day of the quarter , and it looked like we got some reverse window-dressing , _ said Peter Canelo , chief investment strategist at Dean Witter. _ All of a sudden nobody wants to show they own any stocks , _ he said. But foremost among the market's problems remained mounting concern the Federal Reserve is likely to prescribe more of the interest rate medicine it started dispensing last week in an effort to quash inflation pressures in the economy. Yields on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury edged up_to 7.10 percent ahead_of the NAPM report , extending an upward creep that has become a burden for stocks and has some questioning whether rates will level off anytime soon. _ If ( the bond yield ) was a stock , we would buy it , _ said Gary Kaltbaum , technical analyst at J.W. Charles Securities. _ We_ 're getting to levels on the yield that are_ n't even on the one-year chart. _ Financial stocks were pummelled amid the broad decline , including Dow components J.P. Morgan & Co Inc , off 4-1/2 to 98-1/4 , and Travelers Group Inc , down 2-7/8 to 48. Among individual issues , Ascend Communications Inc staggered lower after announcing it would acquire Cascade Communications Corp in a $3.7 billion stock swap.
