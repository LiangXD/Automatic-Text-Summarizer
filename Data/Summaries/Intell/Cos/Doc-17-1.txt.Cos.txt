Sandra Harwitt KEY BISCAYNE , Florida 1997-03-31 She_ 's fresh-faced and formidable and now rules the world of women's tennis. At age 16 , Martina Hingis of Switzerland has swept aside her last 26 opponents on the fast track to becoming the youngest player ever to grab the top ranking in the world. The latest player to fall to the Hingis combination of speed and tennis smarts was Monica Seles in the final of the Lipton Championships.

Rollerblades also fit into the suitcase and residents on Key Biscayne have stopped and stared as the Swiss miss skates by. _ I ca_ n't be all_the_time here at the courts , _ Hingis said. _ It would just get crazy if you would spend all_the_time on the site. Nor does she anticipate feeling fearful of weighty expectations. _ What should I be afraid of ? _ said Hingis , tossing a questioning look. _ Why should I be worried ?
