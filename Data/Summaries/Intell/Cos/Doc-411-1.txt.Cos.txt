November 15, 1996 Dear Personal Donor: In the short while since Goodwill helped him find his job, Robert has learned to thoroughly clean a motel room in about 40 minutes. In their December, 1995 review of the nation's best charities, U.S. News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five Standout Good Guys. While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us. At Goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day: A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients: You can earn the money to support yourself and your family, she says. Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center, a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs. On his way home, he shares the story with four people at a street corner. In order to develop job skills, a man with some serious disabilities begins working in Goodwill's industrial division. These people and their successes are real. Just like the impact Goodwill's work has on our community. The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no time to waste. Your support helps provide real solutions. Please use the enclosed response card and envelope to give generously to Goodwill today.
