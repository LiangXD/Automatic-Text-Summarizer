1996-08-20 Ronald Sandler , chief executive of Lloyd's of London , on Tuesday underwent a second day of court interrogation about the 300-year-old insurance market's multibillion-dollar recovery plan , which he defended as critical to Lloyd's solvency. Sandler was questioned for four hours in a federal courtroom by lawyers for American investors in Lloyd's and by U.S. District Judge Robert Payne about Lloyd's complex restructuring plan to settle large losses. Tens of thousands of investors in Lloyd's worldwide $-- quaintly known as Names $-- were anxiously awaiting the outcome of the case , in which 100 U.S. investors have applied for an injunction to block the recovery plan. Payne told Sandler firmly that the company needed to have a plan for the disposition of leftover assets and that he would need to be told who the benefactors would be. Payne also asked whether Lloyd's was able to pay the total premium if U.S. investors did not back the recovery plan. Separately Tuesday morning , Lloyd's received a boost from another court case in New York , which dismissed action brought against the market by four Names. They had claimed that Lloyd's knew long_ago the extent of liabilities faced by Names. _ We are pleased by this decision.
