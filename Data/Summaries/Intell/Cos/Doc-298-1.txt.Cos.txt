Khatami congratulates Venezuelan nation for Chavez' return Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- President Mohammad Khatami on Friday evening congratulated the Venezuelan government and nation for the victory and restoration of the legitimate government of President Hugo Chavez after a failed military coup in that country. Referring to the difficult period the venezuelan nation went through in the past week, President Chavez said the anti-democractic attempts to topple his government failed with the help of the Almighty God and the people. As to the re-establishment of legal order in his country, Chavez briefed the Iranian president on the latest developments in his country. Chavez was brought back to the Venezuelan presidential palace early Sunday by helicopter from a Caribbean island where he was detained after the coup and thereafter resumed his functions as president. Chavez, whose mandate was due to end in 2006, was forced out of office by the country's armed forces who blamed him for the deaths of 15 people during demonstrations in the streets of central Caracas against an opposition protest which later became violent.
