WASHINGTON 1997-03-31 Selling off federal hydropower plants and power marketing agencies would be very complex and would likely affect electricity prices in some areas , according_to a Congressional report released Monday. The General Accounting Office report surveyed all the interests that the government would need to address if it chose to sell the Southeastern , Southwestern and Western Area Power Marketing Administrations. The report did not specify what the effect would be on rates , saying : _ The potential effects of a divestiture on wholesale and retail electric rates , which in turn would affect regional economies , are other important issues. _ Citing advocates for selling the power marketing agencies , the GAO said the private sector would be able to operate and maintain the assets more efficiently than the government. The Clinton administration itself proposed privatizing the agencies two years ago to earn some quick revenue , but dropped the idea when lawmakers balked at losing the cheap electricity in their districts. If the government decided to privatize the federal assets , it would have to find a way to balance the competing uses of water from federal projects for irrigation , power generation , and protection of fish and wildlife , the GAO said.
