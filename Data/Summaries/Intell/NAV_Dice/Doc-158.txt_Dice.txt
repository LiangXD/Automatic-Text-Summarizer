Argentine pension funds have enjoyed interest rates as high as 35 percent over recent months: No less than 45 percent of the national debt estimated at between $130 and $150 billion is held by the Argentines themselves.But neither dollarization nor the currency board provides a guarantee of low interest rates, as there will always be an "Argentine risk."It is not enough to proclaim, even in the Constitution, that one peso is worth one dollar, for that to be really the case.More than ever in fact, as the financial crisis that is shaking Buenos Aires has a useful message for us: The choice of a currency can never be reduced to a simple act of political will.That leaves the most economically realistic solution, the one backed by the technical experts: Floating the currency, but it is also the most risky.But it would also be a very painful way of restoring credibility, "like when one loses one's virginity and the only solution is to enter a convent," as one monetary expert put it.Unless the peso is devalued before it disappears, that is technically possible but more delicate when it comes to credibility.The Europeans are enthusiastically holding in their hands "the euro, our currency" that for so long had been no more than a much-wielded slogan.First paradox: The Argentine economy is not very open, not even to its neighbors in Latin America.Also on the part of the International Monetary Fund whose principal role is to be watchdog before bailing out those who come unstuck.The linking to the dollar, as a guarantee of stability, was meant to rid them of the hyperinflation running at 2000 percent a year they had experienced during the 1970s and 80s.
