A simple autonomous agent, say, a bacterium, is a Darwinian creature.I know that the moon is they tell me not made of green cheese.We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents.And the stunning fact directly before us, every day, is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf.What in the world is "know-how" ?Now, five chapters later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter, energy, and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf.The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent say, an early bacterium is somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world.I cannot buy Shannon' s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent.Strange and interesting, is it not, that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise?And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present?Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological.Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view.But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics.While fully aware of Hume' s injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent' s perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent.There is no autonomous agent, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations.The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents.In this restricted sense, signs are causally correlated with that which is signified.Where is the place of value in a world of fact?It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, "only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful," is itself not empirically verifiable.But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how.The incoming molecule is "yuck" or "yum."On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like F = MA and Darwin' s "natural selection" and "fitness," that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world.In short, once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere.Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creature namely, at least humans.I know that the earth circles the sun, that the earth is roughly spherical, that chairs are used to sit on.I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent.The know-how is the propagating organization.I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words.But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings, Dan' s happy phrasing, is relevant for E. coli, tigers, us, trees, and autonomous agents in general.Stones and chairs are not, by my definition, autonomous agents.But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all?Unlike "know that," "know-how" does not involve propositions about the world.But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom "intentionality" and "purpose" are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties.At the next level (Dennett, perhaps properly, reserves this for us vertebrates) is the Popperian creature.For the moment, no behavioral learning is to be considered.The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.By contrast, the relation between the word "chair" and that which it signifies, and on which I am now sitting, is arbitrary.Indeed, as I have emphasized before, a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents, ways of making a living, and the search procedures, mutation, recombination, as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents.For this to be true, it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose, say, the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient, be conscious.Hume told us long ago about the "naturalistic fallacy" : One cannot deduce "ought" from "is."Like it or not, the glucose gradient is a sign, a predictor, of "more glucose that way."Yet, clearly, the know-how is distributed.
