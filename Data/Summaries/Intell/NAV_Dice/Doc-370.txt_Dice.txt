Cabinet officials on Wednesday publicly accused the Buenos Aires governor, Carlos Ruckauf, a former vice president and one of the most powerful leaders of the opposition, of instigating the looting to overthrow the government.Mr. de la R?decline began in October 2000 with the resignation of his vice president, Carlos Alvarez, over the government's handling of charges that bribes were paid to opposition senators to pass a new labor law.They are also suggesting that business and consumer loans that are now valued in dollars be revalued into new peso amounts that would reduce the overall debt.The resignation letter, which was delivered to Congress late in the day, followed violent food riots and protests here and in several cities.But Congress can change that, and how it will play its hand will be largely left to opposition leaders, including a former president, Carlos Sa?nem, and Senator Eduardo Duhalde, who lost to Mr. de la R? the 1999 elections.Under the law, a new president should be installed within three months.At least five demonstrators were killed today, bringing the death toll to 21 since the protests began early Wednesday.Ram?uerta, the president of the Senate, is to become Argentina's provisional president for at least 48 hours while the Congress decides how to prepare for new elections, which are likely sometime next year.The president had made a last- ditch effort to form a unity government today with the leading opposition party, but when that was rejected, he announced he would leave.Thousands of demonstrators massed and set bonfires in front of the Congress and presidential palace throughout the day, until riot police, including some on horseback, stormed through the crowds this afternoon clubbing people while reinforcements fired water cannon and rubber bullets.Mr. de la R?resignation will put the country's immediate future in the hands of the moderate opposition party that controls Congress and had recently begun blocking many of the former president's policies.This scheme is designed to help middle-class people with home mortgages and car loans that are currently valued in dollars.Other losers could well be Argentine businesses that owe dollar debts abroad but collect revenue in pesos at home."I believe the economy can be stabilized and grow during a transition government," said Governor Adolfo Rodr?ez Saa of San Luis Province, an influential member of the opposition.Mr. de la R?eclared a state of siege for 30 days on Wednesday, giving him the right to suspend such Constitutional rights as freedom of assembly and speech, and giving him free rein to arrest at will.
