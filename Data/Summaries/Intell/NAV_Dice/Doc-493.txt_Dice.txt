Pedro Malan's attitude in relation to Argentina is very different from that of Jaime Caruana, governor of the Bank of Spain, the Spanish central bank.The Minister believes that tension between Brazil and Argentina, resulting from the floating of the real in 1999, will tend to disappear because the neighboring country is opting for a floating exchange rate system.According to Malan, the dollarization process is irreversible.This was an important step that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso called a little Maastricht, that is, the search for convergence parameters that serve as a reference point for talks between experts from the six countries, the Minister says.Malan defends a different posture: "to set aside the notion of cynicism, skepticism, that things will not work out," and believe, like the Europeans, that there is a future to be built by the Mercosur countries and Chile and Bolivia, the associate members."Today we have comparable statistics; there is a macroeconomic monitoring group in the Finance Ministry and experts from the six countries' central banks who meet regularly."We want to keep alight the flame of a single currency in the region in future, even if a distant one," but until then, "there is the job of consolidating the institutions in the political and institutional sphere, of productive restructuring and of modernizing the State" in six countries - Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.According to Malan, another approach is necessary in this period of transition of the Argentine crisis."The priority now is to unshackle the credit system, for there is no modern economy that can function without credit.According to the Minister, Mercosur managed, after an "enormous technical effort,' something that did not exist in the region two years ago - the harmonization of the statistics of the member countries, Bolivia and Chile, which were not comparable before.
