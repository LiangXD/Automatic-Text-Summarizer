It cannot solve the Israeli people's security problems, because the root of the terrorism is the Israeli occupation and the Israeli settlements on occupied territory.As a first step Israeli forces were sent into the main Palestinian town, Ramallah, where Arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous Palestinian areas are administered.The settlers, who number around 220,000 people, have taken the Israeli Government and consequently both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples hostage.The resolution that was put forward by Saudi Arabia was a plea addressed to the Israeli people over the heads of Ariel Sharon's government.On Thursday the summit adopted a resolution that proposed the recognition of the Jewish state, normal relations, and an end to the conflict in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that Israel has occupied for almost 35 years.No Arab leader was in any doubt that from Sharon's standpoint the resolution was not welcome.Sharon is a master of escalation.According to these sources, Sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while Arafat hesitated.For the time being at least the United States has thus given Sharon a free hand.The summit's declaration was the best piece of news the Middle East has produced since the Oslo Accords between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat were signed on the lawn in front of the White House in Washington in 1993.On Thursday evening a Palestinian suicide bomber attacked a hotel in Natanya where a couple of hundred people had gathered for the traditional Passover meal.Prior to the Natanya massacre Washington had imposed a number of limitations on Sharon.Now he declared that Arafat was an "enemy."His name figured on a list that Israel had shortly before handed over to the Palestinian security service.
