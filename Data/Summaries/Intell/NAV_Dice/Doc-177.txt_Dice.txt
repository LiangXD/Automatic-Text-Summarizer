He said that Northern Alliance commanders were irritated by images of armed US soldiers on Afghan soil, and so media access to the base had to be temporarily suspended.Although Northern Alliance control the main entrance to the base, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of Kabul, just inside the perimeter there is a checkpoint manned by heavily-armed US soldiers."When it gets to the point that Northern Alliance troops start firing in the air just next to a car with reporters, you have to do something about it," said Cordell.However Northern Alliance defence minister General Mohammad Qasim Fahim said the same day that he had rebuffed a British offer to send troops to Kabul in the coming days and insisted he wants a strictly limited UN force."By no means are we trying to set up a permanent presence here, we just want to help," said US military spokesman Sergeant-Major Ray Cordell.It is good, you can see they (the Americans) are here," he said smiling.The US military will not say how many troops they have brought to the base but their presence has already provoked an armed incident.But the ill-disciplined alliance troops showed little-disguised irritation at the Americans' dominant role at Bagram, refusing to allow journalists through to speak to the US soldiers."We have the same caps as the Soviet soldiers, that brings back bad memories for the Afghans," said Cordell.
