& bquo ; To a farmer it '_ s an anathema not to produce on his land and therefore it '_ s not that he is not being responsible in meeting the challenges . & equo ; Many farmers , it turns out , would n't in the least object to making the countryside ?There is a Ministry proposal called & bquo ; extensification . & equo ; It means that the whole farm has to produce 20 per_cent less .Conservationists , farmers and government agencies all agree that there is an opportunity right_now for debate and then decision .It is called & bquo ; set aside . & equo ; A proportion of the farm ?It depends on what is defined as attractive .There is a big fear in the hills that in_order_to maintain businesses in the lowlands , people will diversify into sheep , and the profitability of sheep in the lowlands will be greater . & equo ; In fact , the Countryside Commission has just announced an imaginative scheme for 12 & bquo ; community forests & equo ; on marginal urban fringe farmland .She goes on : & bquo ; The problem with taking a management decision out_of a farmer '_ s hands as an economic decision and putting it into conservationists hands is that the conservationists do n't always agree .There are various calculations about how much land is potentially redundant : it could be as many as three million acres .Or be allowed to go on growing ?& bquo ; In the future , it seems , we are going to be taking arbitrary decisions about what we want from the countryside : the large blue here , a certain bird there , and we are going to manage for those species , which will mean that everything_else will go . & equo ; The countryside may be changing .She says one fear is that land in the hills will become redundant . & bquo ; These are areas where you could say farming was marginal .Britain is over-producing : there will have to be some way of reducing output .Both the farmers and the conservationists agree that there ought_to be a debate .Either way , the countryside changes .There are also emotional objections . & bquo ; We wish to see as many farmers as possible occupying the countryside , & equo ; said Melinda Appleby . & bquo ; We want to see a working countryside and we do n't want to see it fossilised so it '_ s almost like a theme park . & equo ; Farmers have higher hopes of the & bquo ; extensification & equo ; programme in the wings .But there is no debate , and any decisions are likely to be taken , piecemeal and by default .Another problem is that the wildlife lobby is divided even over simple things like the future of old farm woodlands .There is a nettle for a somebody ?One scheme is already in place .THE British farmer is about to wander into fresh woods and pastures new .Unfortunately , even this wo n't be enough : the output figures from well-run organic farms are only between 6 and 12 per_cent below those from intensive estates .there is a case for that too ?They also agree that a debate does n't seem to be taking place .As profitablilty declines , they would go out_of farming .To a farmer it '_ s anathema not to produce on land .Some farmers are likely to achieve this by converting to organic farming .The point is , that for the first time in decades , the environmentalists have a powerful voice ?plus the Commission '_ s other plan for 100,000 acres of new forest in the Midlands , which will also soak up redundant land ?Miss Melinda Appleby is environmental policy adviser to the National Farmers _' Union .He could take up agroforestry ; he could convert to timber ; he could take up government agency schemes and grow winter grass mixtures for wild geese to graze upon , or engineer his fields to be a home for the stone curlew .it might as well be the new Environment Secretary ?One of them is the geography of decline .
