Japan is determined to become a major power in aerospace.In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket.Japan also has a huge space power plant plan.It is supposed to be the next generation rocket that is both inexpensive and highly reliable.Presently, Japan is implementing these plans in different stages.Between 1970 and the end of 1999, Japan launched a total of 66 satellites.In November 1999, a "multi-purpose" satellite was launched by H2 rocket No.In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies.Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development.This satellite doubled the capacity of the test satellite previously launched by Japan.In the field of satellite communications, Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) spent $310 million to develop the ETS-8 (Engineering Test Satellite 8) satellite.The carrier rocket is the foundation of space exploration and utilization.
