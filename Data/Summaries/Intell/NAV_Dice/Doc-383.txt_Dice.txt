Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, easily beaten by the veteran president according to official results, said Mugabe had stolen the vote through violence and intimidation and by preventing hundreds of thousands of people from voting.The US said the election, extending Mugabe's 22-year rule for another six years, was "fundamentally flawed"."The election results ... do not reflect the true will of the people of Zimbabwe and are consequently illegitimate," he said.But observers from South Africa, Namibia and Nigeria all said Mugabe's re-election was legitimate.Norwegian and local observers said thousands of people, mostly in opposition strongholds, had been prevented from voting.The former colonial power Britain said that Mugabe had held on to power through a "systematic campaign of violence and intimidation".He said the former guerilla won his fifth term as leader after taking 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,401 for Tsvangirai.
