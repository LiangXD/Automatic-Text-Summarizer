One of the guards puts a hand behind the head of the detainee, forcing him to look down.While calm has returned to Fleet Hospital 20, officials elsewhere on the base are bracing for what they say may be inevitable: the death of one of the detainees.This is done to "provide positive control," says U.S. Army Col. Terry Carrico, in effect the prison warden.While she sees the detainees as patients, she allows that they're not "regular patients.""The role of chaplain is unique," Saiful-Islam says.Base officials say there are Christian prisoners as well as Muslims.After prayer, the detainees' day goes like this: breakfast, a shower (every other day), sick call, noon prayer, lunch, recreation (15 minutes a couple of times a week), mail call, sunset prayer, dinner, evening prayer and bedtime around 9 p.m.11. When the detainees arrive at Camp X-Ray, they are told they're in Cuba and then undergo a 45-minute intake process, which, like the airstrip landing, is monitored by the Red Cross.Each meal the detainees get is considered halal, or religiously appropriate for Muslims.The hospital is several miles from Camp X-Ray, off Recreation Road."If you do your job right," says Campion, 32, of Kansas City, Mo., "nothing is scheduled to happen."Gen. Michael R. Lehnert, the commander of the prison project, says, "We continue to work to improve living conditions for both the detainees and our security forces.""They didn't know if we were going to take care of them, hurt them or kill them.""Watching wildlife can be a lot of fun," says the sign.The doctors explain this is a common reaction as patients awake from anesthesia.Some guards don't want to talk about their views of the prisoners.This is for prisoners needing medical attention, as a fair number do.Jerome says the hospital feels no different than a hospital in the states, save for the high security and the various languages the detainees speak, including French, Russian, Urdu and Arabic.Just the other day, however, a surgeon took out the eye of a patient who had suffered a sports injury when he was younger."We don't hate the sinner," he says, "but we hate the sin."Fleet Hospital 20 has nine patients today.Along the way, if allowed, the detainees would get to see a bit of Americana, a portrait built over the past century."In the beginning, they were very unsure," says Carrico.After a 25-hour flight of mostly sitting, the prisoners hobble along as the Marines, who look twice as big, walk them out and frisk them.It is day two at X-Ray for the 34 newly arrived from Kandahar.They wear black baseball leg guards and bulletproof vests and carry M-16 rifles.Except for an occasional spitting incident or threat, officials say, the prisoners are docile.Concertina wire and nine guard towers surround Camp X-Ray.But with 300 already in custody, and scores in poor health to begin with, they say something is bound to happen.Abuhena Mohammad Saiful-Islam, 39, speaks more with the detainees than almost anybody at the camp.Unlike other parts of the base, the camp does not have a pretty setting.The prisoners are here because the military considers them "hard-core" terrorists - willing to escape, to kill themselves and others.The 20-bed hospital is a high-tech, air-conditioned white tent which looks like a futuristic movie set, with low ceilings, fluorescent lighting, and padded white walls, floors and ceilings.Within a couple months, he says, the operation will move to another part of Guantanamo called Radio Range, where utilities are more readily available and cells will have cots, air conditioning and toilets.The staff gives reporters a quick tour of the hospital, allowing photographs of some sections but not of the patients."They haven't said that God has abandoned them, because they know," he says."We don't go with a preconceived idea that the person is so and so."That's the hope that they have, that God is their only hope."The security here I would consider tighter than death row in a prison in the United States."Not at the hands of the guards.The American flag is everywhere - painted on the guard towers, flying high in front of the facility.They board buses that will take them to a ferry that will take them across Guantanamo Bay to a detention facility known as Camp X-Ray."You're doing good."The guards mostly communicate with the prisoners via simple English commands and hand signals.On a hot and windy afternoon, the deep blue waters of the Caribbean serve as the postcard backdrop.The detainees also get fingerprinted and photographed.Walk!" the guards shout.
