The DNA section -- the "input" -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer's "hardware".Let's say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a "B" DNA type appears in a DNA section is odd or even.The "computers" are biological molecules, using DNA for software and enzymes for hardware, and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second.If the tip of the input is "B", the input will be labeled as having an odd number of "B" sequences.Some scientists believe DNA-based computers could have an advantage over existing computers based on silicon chips.Prof. Shapiro says the molecular computer is the first of its kind.The computer can also do other calculations, such as checking whether the "B" sequence appears at least once, or at most once, by inserting different types of software DNAs.However, for the uses for which the computers are designated, this level of accuracy is adequate.
