Indeed, big majorities of drivers surveyed support bans on hand-held cellphone use and texting while driving -- 71 percent and 94 percent, respectively.More than half of drivers said making a cellphone call made no difference to their driving performance, and a quarter said texting or emailing made no difference.But 90 percent said that when they are passengers they feel very unsafe if the driver is texting or emailing.But safety advocates are pushing for a national ban on texting while driving.In 2010 there were an estimated 3,092 deaths in crashes affected by a wide range of driver distractions, from eating meals to thumbing email, the safety administration said.The increase in texting while driving came even though many states have banned the practice, and that's alarming, said Jonathan Adkins, a spokesman for the Governors Highway Safety Association.There were very few situations in which drivers said they would never talk on the phone or send texts.So far, there is no evidence that crashes are reduced when cellphone and texting restrictions are implemented," Rader said.At any given moment last year on America's streets and highways, nearly one in every 100 car drivers was texting, emailing, surfing the Web or otherwise using a hand-held electronic device, the safety administration said.About twice as many drivers reported answering incoming calls as making calls while driving, 71 percent to 41 percent.And more drivers reported reading than sending texts or emails."Everyone thinks he or she is an above average driver -- it's all the nuts out there who need educating," said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.In Hartford, there was a 57 percent drop in hand-held phone use, and texting behind the wheel dropped by nearly three-quarters.
