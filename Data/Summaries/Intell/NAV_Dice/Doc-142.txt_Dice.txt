"Many people have been arrested in the past weeks, including suspected separatists and criminals," said an official at the minority religious affairs bureau in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China's furthest west city."Many tour groups have been cancelled, so the region's tourism has been affected," she said.Large numbers of People's Liberation Army troops have also been seen on the move in the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang, to the far west of China, they said.In neighboring Hetian city, a hotbed of Muslim separatists in the impoverished southern part of Xinjiang that also borders Pakistan, the situation was also "peaceful", said an official at the city's foreign affairs office.He also said increasing troop movements had been seen at night around Kashgar, but was unsure where they were going or what their orders were.Another official said Thursday the main expert on Xinjiang from the US embassy in Beijing had been dispatched to the region to discuss regional attitudes to the devastating terror attacks on the US two weeks ago and to Afganistan's ruling ultra-Islamic Taliban regime.However Dong of the Kashgar foreign affairs bureau said the security clampdown was usual, and linked to next week's national day holiday.
