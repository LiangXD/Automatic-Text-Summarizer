In sharp contrast to other African observer teams, the forum said the conduct of the elections fell short of regional expectations.That position chimed closely with views expressed by the main Zimbabwean monitoring group, the Zimbabwe Election Support Network which had 400 observers monitoring the poll and have been heavily critical."If the people of Zimbabwe have a sense that they have been cheated through the election process, it is possible that some could resort to violence," said the foreign minister, Alexander Downer.Mugabe's main challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change, has rejected the outcome of the presidential poll.African observers generally approved of his victory, while Western governments denounced it.The SADC parliamentarians' view was also echoed by the Norwegian observer delegation which said, on Tuesday, that the election failed to meet international standards.The government has rejected all criticism, describing the election as "exemplary, free, fair and peaceful."He said the result was "illegitimate" and a clear case of "highway robbery" by Mugabe, his government and his party, Zanu-PF.Copyright @ 2002 allAfrica.com.Australia, which with South Africa and Nigeria has been mandated to report on the Zimbabwe presidential poll to the Commonwealth, was equally critical.Norway Prime Minister Jan Petersen said in a statement that "The presidential election in Zimbabwe has not satisfied the fundamental requirements for a democratic election."Jack Straw, the foreign secretary of the former colonial power, Britain, which is locked in a verbal war with Mugabe, said the Zimbabwean head of state was bent on achieving "one goal, power at all costs."The climate of insecurity obtaining in Zimbabwe since the 2000 parliamentary elections was such that the electoral process could not be said to adequately comply with the norms and standards for elections in the SADC region," the forum said in a statement.
