ICRC visits, says another soldier, are the highlight of a prisoner's day, since they've been spotted "giving the unshackled prisoners cookies and milk, cigarettes, shaking their hands.""Soldiers and Marines that are guarding the detainees at Camp X-Ray have worse conditions than the detainees," he says."They're getting warm showers, clean laundry, hot chow," Costello says of the prisoners.Though it's Saturday, and we're supposed to be in Cuba until Monday, the military has changed plans and is going to make us leave Guantanamo Sunday morning.And unlike say, Afghan prisons, where starving detainees are reportedly begging to be sent to Gitmo, there's plenty of food to play with.(Human rights hawks say the matter should be decided by a "competent tribunal," whatever that is.)WHILE public affairs officers these days are going to great lengths to talk about how docile the prisoners are, detainees have been reported biting a guard, spitting, and threatening to kill Americans."My editors are going to crush my nuts," says one reporter, probably female."We don't shake their hands," says one camp guard.Much has been made over their being kept in outdoor cells, invariably called "cages," which are topped with corrugated tin-covered wooden roofs that keep what little rain Gitmo gets (six inches a year) off the prisoners."The other day," says Westbrook, "one of the guys tried to do a naked cartwheel."Still, the overseers of the prison are concerned that detainees aren't getting enough pita bread with their meals, and they're planning to make the food spicier, just the way the prisoners like it back home.Running the public affairs show is Army Lt.It is there that 158 al Qaeda/Taliban prisoners are being detained because, depending on who you ask, it is an ideal, sunny clime, it's not subject to the get-out-of-jail escape hatches of U.S. federal law, or because, as one senior Pentagon official says, "The lawyers didn't want to go on 14-hour flights to some guano rock in the Pacific."About the only foreign leader who has supported the American detainee camp, ironically, is Fidel Castro, who is either angling to end the embargo or inching ever closer to dementia.The good news is Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld will be visiting the detainees' Camp X-Ray the next morning."Though there are some Air Force personnel over there, so who knows what's going on?"Col. Costello, who has decided to patch things up with the reporter he snapped at, and who, after getting the sign-off from Southern Command, has cleared us to stay through Rumsfeld's visit."One thing's for sure," says a wire reporter, "you won't have to sort through all your notes to decide what to lead with."What we're trying to do isn't exactly clear at this point.While he remains as firm as ever that the detainees are "illegal combatants," not "prisoners of war," which would afford them more rights under the Geneva Convention, he nicely avoids plucking the only hair worth splitting--whether the captives' status is his call.Those who think the prisoners are getting coddled (Rep.After leaving the snipers, I collar other grunts who say they believe the prisoners are more apt to act out whenever they see one of the regular visitors from the International Committee of the Red Cross enter the camp."They're actually going to paint arrows on the floors of the cells so they'll know to face north," he says.A sign on the wall says "Air Terminal of the Year 2000.""You're not allowed to stay," says Costello.John Mica, a Florida Republican, visited the camp and said it's "too good for the bastards") will be happy to know that the shampoo is not jojoba-enriched.Costello, like many Gitmo types, is baffled at the uproar over the prisoners' treatment.The latest report has Army guards directing detainees on which way to pray to Mecca."They're looking to be disciplined," says one, so that any aggressive guard behavior will make it look as if they're being brutalized by the American military in front of international witnesses.With all the global bellyaching about the detainees' right to humane treatment, it's hard to imagine them getting better treatment than they're already receiving.The prisoners, by contrast, get to read their Korans, while novels and more "religious books" are on the way."I'd hate to see who got second place," whispers one reporter.Sitting on a bus on the tarmac, waiting for the secretary to emerge from his plane, we pass the time as journalists do, discussing the AP-style spelling of "bin Laden," speculating whether the prisoners will get an Internet cafe (one of them has asked for video games), and making fun of the fresh-meat Pentagon press corps, who are overdressed in heavy wools instead of our much cooler island linens.We are certainly interrogating the prisoners, though base sources won't divulge any information that's been gleaned."They're getting 2,600 calories a day.There's an obvious culture clash (military personnel don't get paid to ask why; journalists don't get paid otherwise)."I'm up to my ears in Vieques," says Navy Lt."North, east, whatever," he replies, "I'm Lutheran--I don't know where the hell it is."Still, says another soldier, "They're a pain in the ass.It's understandable if public affairs types are a little testy.
