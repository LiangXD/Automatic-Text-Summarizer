Hence one can see that it is not to be surprised that the United States chimed in with the Venezuela's coup organizers.This is far out of tune with the attitude the United States used to take when a coup occurred in other countries.According to US news media, that coup in Venezuela had something to do with the United States.Why didn't the United States inform Venezuela's constitutional government of the coup attempt by Rincon and the others?On this matter, "supporting democracy" is but a signboard used by the United States.Probably this is the major reason why the United States is happy to see a change of government in Venezuela.After taking the Office of Presidency, Chavez has implemented an independent foreign policy and seemed to be not in step with the United States in many respects.
