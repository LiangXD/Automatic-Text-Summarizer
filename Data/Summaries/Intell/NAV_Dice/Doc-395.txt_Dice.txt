"Our officers are more concerned with doing Pentagon damage control concerning the detainees than looking after the troops."They're not pleased that the brass, the lawmakers and the press are more interested in the well-being of the detainees than the soldiers guarding them, and that they might as well be invisible."We are responsible enough to secure the prisoners, but not enough to have a beer.""The Marine general here says we can have a beer when off duty, but our Army leadership is running so scared that it set a no-drinking policy," says another troop.Maybe someday, do-gooders, editors, lawmakers and senior Army leaders will remember our soldiers are human beings with human rights, too, and get their side of the story.This time around, they've already bitten one of the soldiers guarding them and threatened to kill anybody else who gets too close.Had anyone checked, they would have discovered that our U.S. Army Military Police guarding the terrorists think the prisoners are being treated a lot better than they are.They get four hot meals a day, fresh fruit, regular issues of snacks such as sunflower seeds, regular clean clothes laundered by the Marine supply system," says another soldier.The Marines are right, the Army's wrong, and we're stuck in the middle."
