Although the islands saw little action, as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power.By the time of the Crusades, many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated.The Persian Wars As Athens rose in influence and power in the West, it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire.An important early material, obsidian, was discovered on the island of Milos.While Byzantine land was being divided, there was no one in control of the seas, so pirates raided towns on many of the islands.After the war, in 1949, the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation.Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors, who were led by Philip II of Macedon.Homer wrote his epic works on Chios; and lyrical poetry was much admired, particularly the work of the poets Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos.The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state.Finally, Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor, which became part of the new Turkish state.Cycladic Culture At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the Cyclades islands.The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified cities, but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders.The struggle bypassed most of the islands, although there was fierce fighting on Samos.The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean Islands, which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade.Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands, the next major power change brought influence from the West.Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories.The Aegean Islands, which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes, became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse.The Persians were defeated, and Athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it.In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval, the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans (at around 1300 b.c. ), who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland.Later, in 454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age.Santorini (Thira), the next major island north, was heavily influenced by Crete, and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time.The Turks lost a short war with Italy, and were forced to relinquish the Dodecanese islands to the Italians.The Ottoman Empire was weakening, however, and in 1821, the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time.The Ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled, forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean.Greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of Asia Minor, which for over 2,000 years had had a substantial Greek population.Several islands and Greek city-states agreed to work together, and created a treasury to fund their plans, which was held on the island of Delos.
