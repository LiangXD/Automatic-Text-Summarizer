He said the government had not been aware of the ruling by Bosnia's Human Rights Chamber that measures should be taken to stop four of the suspects being taken out of the country.A Bosnian government official said legal procedures had been respected in the case, but a senior UN human rights officer in Bosnia said they had been "trampled over."Bosnian authorities have handed over to US custody six Algerians detained in October on suspicion of involvement in terrorism but ordered released this week by a local court, the US embassy said on Friday.Earlier, the US embassy in Sarajevo said in a statement: "The six Algerian nationals who have been detained by BiH (Bosnia and Herzegovina) authorities since mid-October have been transferred to US custody.International officials said US officials had not been willing to provide Bosnia's justice system with the intelligence information that prompted their detention.The US embassy said the suspects would be treated humanely and in accordance with international law.All were Algerians, although one also had a Yemeni passport possibly obtained fraudulently, international officials said.Not only had a court ordered their release on Thursday but the state's top human rights body had instructed authorities to prevent four being taken out of the country by force."It's very disappointing," Madeleine Rees, head of the Bosnia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said of the operation.Washington is already under fire from human rights groups for its treatment of prisoners captured in Afghanistan and held at Guantanamo Bay.
