Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions.Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%.A company spokesman said it was "possible, but highly unlikely," that the plant might never be built.The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project.Mr. Maxwell said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills' share increased to 30% or more.Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg.Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume.Although he called current market conditions "highly competitive," Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year.And now Kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $1 billion cereal plant.Kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market.Last Friday's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic.
