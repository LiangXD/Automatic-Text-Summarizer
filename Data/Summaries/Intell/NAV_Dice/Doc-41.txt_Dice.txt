Yoo Choon-sik SEOUL 1997-03-31 South Korea on Monday raised the ceiling for foreign share-ownership by three percentage points , but analysts said they saw little short-term impact on the local stock market because_of poor fundamentals .But the Finance Ministry said it was considering further expanding the ceiling within this year .The Finance Ministry said it would raise the aggregate foreign ownership ceiling to 23 percent of a listed company from the current 20 percent , effective from May 1 .The ministry said it expected the increased ceiling to bring a further $3 billion into the market , but securities analysts estimated the fresh inflow of funds at between $500 million and $600 million .Analysts said the country's growing current account deficit and the resulting depreciation of the won are the main factors discouraging foreign investment in local stocks ."_ Foreigners are paying premiums over the counter for these shares , _" said Rhee .Therefore , I think the actual announcement will have a limited impact , _" Rhee said .The government had earlier said a further three percentage point rise in the limit would take place in 1998 and 1999 , and the ceiling would be removed altogether in 2000 .The aggregate foreign ownership ceiling on "_ strategically important _" Pohang Iron and Korea Electric Power Corp will be raised to 18 percent from the current 15 percent .
