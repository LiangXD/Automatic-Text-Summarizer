For_once , the UK is in the good books of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) for our support of the European Remote Sensing ( ERS ) programme , which will use the most complex satellites it has ever attempted to build . & bquo ; It '_ s one of the most important projects we have for the 1990s , & equo ; says Philip Goldsmith , head of Earth observation at the European Space Agency .Whilst other space agencies have equally ambitious plans , they remain as blueprints , or , as one European scientist puts it , & bquo ; pie-in-the-sky-eyes-in-the-sky . & equo ; ERS-1 has five instruments which will scan the Earth at microwave wavelengths to monitor ocean , ice and land resources .But the emphasis for ERS-1 is science , as the ERS programme is ESA '_ s contribution to Woce , the World Ocean Circulation Experiment , an important part of global climate research in the 1990s .& bquo ; The key to the ERS programme is continuity , & equo ; says Guy Duchossois of ESA headquarters .Though ESA admits there have been electronic problems with one of the system '_ s processors , it '_ s hardly surprising . & bquo ; It '_ s the most complex instrument we '_ ve ever built , & equo ; says Joe McCaughey , Marconi '_ s project manager . & bquo ; ERS as a whole is a quantum leap for Europe . & equo ; The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire has provided the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer , an infrared instrument which will measure sea surface temperatures down to 0.3C . & bquo ; There are Americans who '_ d give their eye teeth for this sort of data , & equo ; says one ERS project scientist at the laboratory .Perhaps more importantly , governmental space sources relate that Margaret Thatcher is behind ERS-2 . & bquo ; She knows about ERS-2 and is enthusiastic about it , & equo ; says one .ERS-1 is expected to return the first quantitive data on these processes at the poles .The Active Microwave Instrument radar system , built by Marconi Space Systems , is significant because it can be used over land or ocean : it will return vital information about how the wind interacts with waves .Ice coverage limits the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and ocean , effectively & bquo ; insulating & equo ; polar regions from sunlight during summertime . & bquo ; You '_ d be amazed how little we know about the polar regions , & equo ; says Dr Preben Goodmandsen of the Technical University of Denmark . & bquo ; During the wintertime , there '_ s no sunlight .Nearly 10 per_cent of the Earth '_ s surface is covered by ice , which remains as terra incognita to climatologists as it was to 17th-century explorers .It '_ s an area in which Europe has forged ahead and which , against all the odds , is actively supported by our very own government .ERS-1 is currently under test in Toulouse , scheduled for launch next October , at_least two years before any other satellites as part of an international monitoring programme for the 1990s .How the wind affects the ocean and modifies the heat exchanged with the atmosphere is not well understood , but is of paramount importance to weather forecasters who can not wait for ERS-1 to begin operations .Climate modelling and assessing environmental change will need more than three years _' data if it is to be enhanced .
