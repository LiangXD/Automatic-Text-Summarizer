Fourteen search teams that were scouring the area Friday were supplemented with additional volunteer teams from across the state Saturday morning, McDonald said.The 58-year-old True, whose extreme-distance running prowess is detailed in the book "Born to Run," set out on what -- for him -- would have been a routine 12-mile run Tuesday from The Wilderness Lodge and Hot Springs, where he was staying."He's such an integral part of the fabric of the ultra community," Sandrock said.He said True gave no indication of a specific route, which made the search more difficult.Body of missing ultra marathoner found in New Mexico wilderness Searchers on Saturday found the body of renowned long-distance runner Micah True, who vanished four days earlier after heading out from a lodge for a morning run in the rugged wilderness near New Mexico's Gila National Forest.Lodge co-owner Dean Bruemmer, who helped with the search Saturday, said he last saw his friend at breakfast.True, who had been friends with Bruemmer and his wife, Jane, for 10 years, would often visit their lodge while traveling between Mexico and his Boulder, Colo., home."There are a lot of trailheads up the road," said Bruemmer, whose lodge is about four miles from the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument.
