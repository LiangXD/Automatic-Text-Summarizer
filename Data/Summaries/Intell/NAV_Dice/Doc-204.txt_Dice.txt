All the world's countries and peoples are affected by climate changes but it is the poor countries that are being hit the hardest.For later periods, sharper reductions are necessary and there is also the need to get more countries to take on climate obligations.A quota is a right to emit a certain quantity of climate gases during a certain period and this right can be sold on a market.According to the United Nations' climate panel, in the next 10 to 20 years changes in the climate will be almost unaffected by what we do in the way of initiatives in the next few years to reduce emissions of climate gases.Norway should be in the forefront of combating climate problems."The government wants to point to a significant reduction of climate gate emissions before 2005 after Norway has ratified the Kyoto Protocol in the course of the year," Environmental Protection Minister Borge Brende has written.There is consensus that a broad quota system with international quota exchange should be used to achieve our emission responsibilities during the first obligatory period, 2008-2012.The climate changes will be different from region to region.Regardless of what Norway and other countries manage to do in this respect, we must prepare ourselves for climate changes.In the government's work to put the quota system into shape in Norway, we are now discussing a number of problems.I am pleased that there now seems to be broad political consensus that in Norway as well we should get under way with an early quota system.The elements in a more offensive climate policy are:Initiatives between now and 2008: The government wants to show demonstrable progress in the reduction of climate emissions by 2005.In addition to being effective, an early quota system would also give business and industry useful experience before the international quota system following the Kyoto Protocol comes into effect in 2008.Many countries, among them Denmark, Great Britain, and Sweden, are already under way developing early quota systems.A proposal for an early quota system will be at the center of this report.Businesses that are obligated by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quotas they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions.The government's policy statement states, among other things, that the establishment of a national quota system should be speeded up.
