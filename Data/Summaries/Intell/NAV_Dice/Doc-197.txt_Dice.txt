The important point is that Argentina has enjoyed the IMF's advice in the execution of these policies.Another important point is Argentina's connections with the global economy.Anyway, now in addition to the IMF, the US government, as the biggest investor in Argentina's economy, is ignoring its commitments in the current situation.What is clear is that Argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today.Some $76 billion of the $132 billion debt is accounted for by foreign loans, which were lavished on Argentina.
