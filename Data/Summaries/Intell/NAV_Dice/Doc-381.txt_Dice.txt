Unfortunately, some leading African countries like South Africa and Nigeria have compounded the problem by accepting Mugabe's victory despite earlier assertions that they would not recognize the results of a rigged election.These steps would be far more effective if they were joined by major African states.International observers called the process deeply flawed, and the Bush administration has refused to recognize the declared results.It is blessed with fertile agricultural land, and during the first dozen years of Mugabe's rule it was relatively prosperous and free.
