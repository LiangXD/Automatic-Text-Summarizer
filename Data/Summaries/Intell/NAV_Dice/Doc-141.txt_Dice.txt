The situation in which Putin has agreed to open former Soviet military airfields to American armed forces in three (former Soviet) Central Asian countries could be regarded as dramatic.Putin has exceeded the "positive neutrality policy" his country (the Soviet Union at the time) has pursued during the Gulf War, and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable.But main stream Russian military policy has been to keep a distance from America, the country that has been historically responsible for "educating" the Taliban that had caused the demise of Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan.Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of "international terror."Putin has written the name of Moscow on the registration page of the American side.If we view this warning against the background that Putin's government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin's hands behind "Chechen terrorism," we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow's views.And Putin has established the prospect of taking further steps in this regard.
