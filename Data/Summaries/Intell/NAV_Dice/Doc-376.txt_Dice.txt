But he said that he disagreed with the decision by the fund and the Bush administration to continue the aid program in August, when he said the situation in Argentina had likely deteriorated beyond repair.Moreover, it is difficult to place blame for Argentina's economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy was designed by Argentina itself, sometimes over the objections of the fund's economists.When Argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, Bush administration officials did not take a firm position, allowing the I.M.F. to make the call on withholding additional loans, people involved in the fund's deliberations said."If Argentina got its core economic policies right, it would have avoided this problem," said Charles Calomiris, a finance and economics professor at Columbia University who has been sounding the alarm about Argentina for months.21 - The deadly riots in Argentina, the collapse of its government and another multibillion dollar bailout gone awry have raised fresh questions about the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund and the financial policies of the United States, the fund's leading shareholder.Some say the monetary fund showed callousness by failing to give new aid to Argentina early this month, as the country's economic program, designed with I.M.F. approval, was forcing painful austerity measures on its citizens.Fund officials say privately that they cannot avoid financial bailouts altogether.The French, who like the United States are significant fund shareholders, have called on the lending agency to step up its involvement to help Argentina recover.But many say the monetary fund should have called government officials to account sooner.Argentina's Chaos Raises New Doubts on Monetary Fund WASHINGTON, Dec.At an August meeting at I.M.F. headquarters, fund officials told Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, that the country would be better off delaying debt payments.These criticisms, even if contradictory, increase pressure on the I.M.F. and the Bush administration to articulate a clear policy toward financial rescue efforts, which often come under fire even when they are judged successful.Latin American and European government leaders today joined protesters in Buenos Aires, Wall Street traders and financial experts in putting at least part of the blame for Argentina's problems on the lending agency and the Clinton and Bush administrations.The fund decided to suspend aid for a program that appeared to have little chance of success.Michael Mussa, the I.M.F.'s chief economist until last spring, said the fund was justified in providing aid to Argentina late last year.Even the harshest critics of the I.M.F. put most of the blame for Argentina's current plight on a succession of governments in Buenos Aires.
