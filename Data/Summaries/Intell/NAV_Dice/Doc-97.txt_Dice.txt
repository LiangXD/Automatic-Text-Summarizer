David Lawder DETROIT 1997-03-31 Continuing at a steady but unspectacular pace , U.S. car and truck sales for March are expected to show gains for Japanese and German automakers at the expense of Detroit's Big Three , analysts said Monday .The Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase in interest rates last week is not expected to have an immediate effect on vehicle sales , analysts said .Ford's truck sales are expected to be up 2 percent to 3 percent , while Chrysler's truck sales are expected to be flat to down 1 percent .But GM's improved sales are not expected to be enough to offset the market share gains by Toyota Motor Corp. , Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and other Japanese automakers , particular in the intermediate passenger car market .Analysts said Japanese automakers are expected to continue increasing sales and market share , based on a hot portfolio of new products coupled with a weak Japanese yen that allows them to price more aggressively .CS First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas said Chrysler's sluggish passenger car sales are "_ troublesome , _" given the company's increased dealer incentive spending in the first quarter .Analysts estimate that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for March light vehicle sales will be about 15 million to 15.4 million units , compared with 15.5 million a year ago .This year's market is very competitive , _" said Schroder Wertheim analyst John Casesa .Last week at the New York Auto Show , both Chrysler and Ford signaled that their sales may be down slightly ."_ The March numbers are going to show that the market is not as robust as the annual rate suggests . _"
