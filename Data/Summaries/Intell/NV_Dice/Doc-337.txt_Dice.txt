"I think it was a serious offer," he said of the overture, which some in Miami scorned as a publicity stunt.But Buehn said the Cubans have not raised any formal objections to the base's latest mission."It is in our museum, we still have it," he said.Nor is there any worry over the infrastructure, which was stretched to the limit in 1994 and 1995 when the base became an encampment 55,000-plus Haitian and Cuban boat people -- and the commander sent civilians stateside to make room for the 8,000 U.S. personnel who came to tend to the migrant project.He arrived here in 2000, and is now presiding over a transformation of this suburban-style base that, until its latest assignment, was a backwater of 2,400 people -- 700 of them Navy and Marine members, the rest Jamaican and Filipino contract workers plus family members.So much so, he said, that not a single family member or contractor has so far requested to leave here, the oldest U.S. base overseas, and the only one left in a communist country.Geographically the base is split by the bay, and united by a ferry service.Now he's still head honcho of the base itself.But Buehn said the new mission has given residents -- both civilians and service members -- a sense of unity and purpose after the uncertainty of Sept.Were Washington to decide to maintain Guantanamo as an offshore terrorist detention center, Buehn said, he would propose building a maximum security facility on leeward side.With a heavy layer of Marine and Army security, their safety is not a concern, he said.And I can't speak for everybody on the base but I think most people are glad to be part of it, excited by it."
