"The committee has decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate effect," Mr. Howard said, reading the statement alone, apparently as a face-saving gesture to Mr. Mbeki, whose own election observers in Zimbabwe found the vote "legitimate."Mr. Mbeki and Mr. Obasanjo - both of whose countries have under past undemocratic regimes been excluded from the Commonwealth - are torn between solidarity with a fellow African leader who was a crusader against colonialism, and their commitment to democratic standards as part of African economic regeneration.In the 60's, white-ruled South Africa quit the Commonwealth rather than be suspended over apartheid; Nigeria was suspended in the 1990's during military rule because of the execution of the human rights activist Ken Saro Wiwa.The unusual step was meant to punish President Robert Mugabe for his stewardship of elections this month that were widely criticized outside Africa as rigged.The response to Mr. Mugabe's behavior was seen by many outsiders as a token of South Africa's and Nigeria's own commitment to democracy as a way of fostering economic renewal.The Commonwealth also supported moves to resolve the country's violent crisis over the seizure of white farmers' land, backing Mr. Mugabe in his commitment to redistribute territory among landless black Zimbabweans.According to the statement, the leaders of South Africa and Nigeria will continue to talk to Mr. Mugabe about ways to lift the suspension.Fiji has been suspended twice, once for 10 years.
