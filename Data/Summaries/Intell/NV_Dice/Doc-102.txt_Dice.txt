Police said they have interviewed registered sex offenders in the area near where LaMar was last seen.Smith was among 581 volunteers who turned out Saturday to search for 15-year-old Sierra LaMar, of Morgan Hill, Calif., who was last seen March 16, the Contra Costa Times reported.Her pants and shirt were found neatly folded inside the Juicy brand bag, though it's not known whether those are the clothes she was last seen wearing, police said.She last was seen March 16 leaving her home at around 7:15 a.m. to walk to a school bus stop.Police said the last text LaMar sent out was shortly before 7 a.m. the day she disappeared, and it was not a distress text.The girl's bag also was discovered a couple of miles from her home.LaMar's phone was recovered shortly after her disappearance about three-quarters of a mile from her home after police tracked its electronic ping.Investigators said last week that they think LaMar, a sophomore at Sobrato High School, likely was the victim of an acquaintance abduction.He also said there was no forensic evidence on the phone.
