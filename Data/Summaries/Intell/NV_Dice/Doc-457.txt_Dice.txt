"The situation we see now is what I call the Last Supper -- it is ZANU-PF's final feast," Mr. Tsvangirai said.He said the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest."I feel very strongly for these people," Mr. Tsvangirai said."Food is now a major issue," said Shari Eppel of Amani Trust, a human-rights organization.We have come across cases of people having to have a ZANU-PF card before they are allowed to buy from the Grain Marketing Board," which is the body that controls imports and sales.But he focused on the violence and hunger that have plagued many Zimbabweans since the controversial presidential election, at least in part a state-orchestrated operation aimed at crushing the opposition, he said."According to reports we have received, they are taken to the police to denounce the MDC, then to the war veterans, where they go through a public confession," Mrs. Eppel said.Mr. Tsvangirai, the 50-year-old leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, alleged in an interview that a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution the ruling ZANU-PF has waged against him and his supporters.HARARE -- Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from some areas of the drought-ravaged country as punishment for not voting the correct way in March's election.Mr. Tsvangirai also touched on his own legal battle with the government: On May 31, he is to stand trial on a charge of treason, accused of plotting to have Mr. Mugabe assassinated.Ground corn, known locally as "mealie meal," is the staple diet of millions of Zimbabweans who can afford little else.In the southwestern region of Matabeleland, for example, cases have been reported where people had to go through a "cleansing" routine to purge them of their MDC sympathies before being allowed to buy corn.
