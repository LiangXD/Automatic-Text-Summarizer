He said that Venezuela was led away from that path because the same thing would have happened here.The president charged that attacks targeting his person have gone on for over 10 years, and that he has been accused, among other things, of ties with the guerrillas, of buying arms and trying to set up a communist regime in Venezuela.He noted that as the year draws to a close, the indicators are positive for Venezuela, then emphasized that the country has regained such internationally recognized posts as the presidency of the Group of the 15 and the Group of the 77.President Hugo Chavez has warned that certain sectors have once again taken up the idea of looking forceful way out in Venezuela, either through a coup or an attack that would end his life.Chavez added that "they are going around looking for a Pinochet, analyzing man by man to see who could be the Pinochet that they could pit against Chavez, and I am sure that there is no Pinochet in the FAN."We were meddling in an internal conflict of another country, which is a violation of international law and which in turn gave the guerrillas the right to attack our military units."
