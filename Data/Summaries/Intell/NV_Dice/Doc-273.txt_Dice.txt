Courtaulds PLC announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value.Some analysts have said Courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined.The establishment of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as early as next year's first quarter.Though Mr. Packer has since sold his stake, Courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy.
