ISLAMABAD, Nov 24 (AFP) - Japanese Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka held "warm" talks here on Saturday with a senior UN official on the refugee crisis in Afghanistan and the hazards facing those wanting to return, a Japanese official said.The talks focused on the need to rehabilitate Afghanistan to pave the way for the safe return of the estimated four million Afghan refugees living in neighbouring countries, foreign ministry spokesman Daisuke Matsunaga said.Even before September 11, Pakistan was playing host to an estimated 2.5 million refugees who had fled Afghanistan through 22 years of war and ethnic bloodshed.He told a news conference that Filippo Grandi, regional emergency coordinator for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), had thanked Japan for its contribution to international efforts to aid the refugees.In the meantime, however, the UNHCR, through its Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (OCHA), was trying to provide tents, clothing and heaters to returning refugees as well as to displaced people within the country wanting to return to their towns and villages.
