Eugene Moosa TOKYO 1997-03-31 Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto , moving to tackle his biggest political problem , vowed on Monday to push through legislation to extend land leases for U.S. military bases beyond a May deadline .Private land for U.S. bases is expropriated by the Japanese government , not the U.S. military itself .The new legislation will , in effect , give the Japanese government a temporary extension of its leases on land occupied by the U.S. bases after the current contracts expire .Without the proposed revisions to the land laws , the government would be "_ illegally _" occupying the land .Hashimoto faces a May 14 deadline on the leases on land owned by some 3,000 people on Japan's southern Okinawa island , who are refusing to renew the contracts .Local authorities on Okinawa , where about half of the 40,000 U.S. troops in Japan are stationed , want the bases closed by 2015 but Tokyo strongly opposes such a move .The case is now before an Okinawan land expropriation committee , whose decision to renew leases was not expected before the May deadline because_of a lengthy hearing process .Japan PM vows to push new law for U.S. bases .
