& equo ; The end result is that Dr Jones takes on overseas researchers . & bquo ; That '_ s fine as far as I am concerned & equo ; he says . & bquo ; They do n't cost British industry or taxpayers a thing , but of_course they take all their expertise abroad .& bquo ; Whatever the Government '_ s idea is , I do n't think that '_ s it , somehow . & equo ;which is lucky because amines are actually very toxic . & equo ; After their initial breakthrough , the team still had much to do before the process became commercially viable .& bquo ; It '_ s exactly the same , essentially , as making nylon , & equo ; he says . & bquo ; To do that , you take a_lot_of identical molecules called amines and join them together to form a chain .Developing the diet has had great scientific spin-offs . & bquo ; It '_ s amazing that a multi-million pound industry was built on an animal nobody knew anything about , & equo ; Dr Jones says . & bquo ; We have 50 years of data on the chicken or the pig .& bquo ; Once we had solved the thickness problem , it became a commercial possibility , & equo ; says Dr Jones , & bquo ; and Mars ?& bquo ; Frippak support our work generously , & equo ; he says . & bquo ; But they are understandably reluctant to pay for research students , because they will probably go off and join the competition .A team led by Dr David Jones , of Bangor '_ s renowned School of Ocean Sciences , designed a revolutionary new feed , using a process called microencapsulation which puts a thin , digestible membrane around each tiny food particle .Dr Eric Edwards of the Shellfish Association says : & bquo ; Customer reaction is that they are stylish and upmarket . & equo ; Demand in Europe and North America continues to rise by 4 per_cent a year $- despite the fact that natural sources are already overfished .But it soon became obvious that the proteins of the nutrient contained the correct chemical groups , and that the food molecules themselves were polymerizing and creating the capsule membrane .Traditionally , prawn farmers have trapped these young adults ( or & bquo ; post-larvae & equo ; as they are called ) and put them into ponds .But Dr Jones '_ s involvement with industry has led him into difficulties ?& bquo ; We know how fast food moves through its gut , how much energy it takes to make one post-larval prawn from the day it hatches , and_so_on .From a modest 1,000 tonnes a year in the early 1970s , the world '_ s prawn farms are expected to produce 440,000 tonnes by 1990 .A team of scientists from the distinctly untropical environment of the University College of North Wales in Bangor has solved some of these problems by designing food fit for a prawn to eat .& bquo ; It '_ s a real Catch 22 situation .We '_ ve learnt an enormous amount because the microcapsule is such an ideal tool for simplifying and controlling food intake . & equo ; Dr Jones and his team are now extending their work to other species , and to the post-larval stage , which leads to the ultimate product ?& bquo ; Haemoglobin , chicken egg and many other natural proteins are rich in the important chemical groups , and these cross-link without any problem at all .& bquo ; Now if , instead_of having a single interface between the two liquids , you emulsify the two ( like oil and vinegar in French dressing ) the reaction occurs over the surface of each suspended droplet , creating a capsule . & equo ; Originally , the team mixed prawn nutrients with amines , thinking that they would be needed to form the capsule .So the problem was to create a feed which came in particles of the right size ( five millionths of a metre across ) , could be freeze-dried , would not foul the water , dissolve or feed the bugs .& bquo ; The commercial aspects are very good , of_course ?But while rising demand , high prices and fast growth provide the stimulus , the prawn '_ s life-cycle presents many problems for the would-be farmer .In the past , hatcheries have had to rely on live feed , which is as unreliable and expensive to harvest from nature as it is to grow artificially .There are more than 1,500 hatcheries in Taiwan alone .& bquo ; Through refining our feed , by leaving things out and seeing what happens , we have been able to define the dietary requirements of the prawn throughout its development .The project '_ s got alpha ratings , but the council saw the industrial involvement and said & bquo ; Go to industry ?The larvae undergo a complex cycle of 12 stages in almost as many days , making their way back inshore as they reach their adult form .Ted Nield reports By TED NIELD PRAWNS are not small fry .
