Much has been made over their being kept in outdoor cells, invariably called "cages," which are topped with corrugated tin-covered wooden roofs that keep what little rain Gitmo gets (six inches a year) off the prisoners."They're getting warm showers, clean laundry, hot chow," Costello says of the prisoners.ICRC visits, says another soldier, are the highlight of a prisoner's day, since they've been spotted "giving the unshackled prisoners cookies and milk, cigarettes, shaking their hands.""Soldiers and Marines that are guarding the detainees at Camp X-Ray have worse conditions than the detainees," he says.(Human rights hawks say the matter should be decided by a "competent tribunal," whatever that is.)And unlike say, Afghan prisons, where starving detainees are reportedly begging to be sent to Gitmo, there's plenty of food to play with."My editors are going to crush my nuts," says one reporter, probably female.WHILE public affairs officers these days are going to great lengths to talk about how docile the prisoners are, detainees have been reported biting a guard, spitting, and threatening to kill Americans.Though it's Saturday, and we're supposed to be in Cuba until Monday, the military has changed plans and is going to make us leave Guantanamo Sunday morning."The other day," says Westbrook, "one of the guys tried to do a naked cartwheel.""We don't shake their hands," says one camp guard.It is there that 158 al Qaeda/Taliban prisoners are being detained because, depending on who you ask, it is an ideal, sunny clime, it's not subject to the get-out-of-jail escape hatches of U.S. federal law, or because, as one senior Pentagon official says, "The lawyers didn't want to go on 14-hour flights to some guano rock in the Pacific."Still, the overseers of the prison are concerned that detainees aren't getting enough pita bread with their meals, and they're planning to make the food spicier, just the way the prisoners like it back home.About the only foreign leader who has supported the American detainee camp, ironically, is Fidel Castro, who is either angling to end the embargo or inching ever closer to dementia.While he remains as firm as ever that the detainees are "illegal combatants," not "prisoners of war," which would afford them more rights under the Geneva Convention, he nicely avoids plucking the only hair worth splitting--whether the captives' status is his call.Running the public affairs show is Army Lt.What we're trying to do isn't exactly clear at this point.The latest report has Army guards directing detainees on which way to pray to Mecca."Though there are some Air Force personnel over there, so who knows what's going on?"The good news is Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld will be visiting the detainees' Camp X-Ray the next morning.Col. Costello, who has decided to patch things up with the reporter he snapped at, and who, after getting the sign-off from Southern Command, has cleared us to stay through Rumsfeld's visit.With all the global bellyaching about the detainees' right to humane treatment, it's hard to imagine them getting better treatment than they're already receiving."One thing's for sure," says a wire reporter, "you won't have to sort through all your notes to decide what to lead with."After leaving the snipers, I collar other grunts who say they believe the prisoners are more apt to act out whenever they see one of the regular visitors from the International Committee of the Red Cross enter the camp.Those who think the prisoners are getting coddled (Rep."They're actually going to paint arrows on the floors of the cells so they'll know to face north," he says.Sitting on a bus on the tarmac, waiting for the secretary to emerge from his plane, we pass the time as journalists do, discussing the AP-style spelling of "bin Laden," speculating whether the prisoners will get an Internet cafe (one of them has asked for video games), and making fun of the fresh-meat Pentagon press corps, who are overdressed in heavy wools instead of our much cooler island linens."You're not allowed to stay," says Costello.But that didn't stop the Mirror's Stephen Moyes from method reporting by donning an al Qaeda rig.The prisoners, by contrast, get to read their Korans, while novels and more "religious books" are on the way.John Mica, a Florida Republican, visited the camp and said it's "too good for the bastards") will be happy to know that the shampoo is not jojoba-enriched."They're looking to be disciplined," says one, so that any aggressive guard behavior will make it look as if they're being brutalized by the American military in front of international witnesses."I'm up to my ears in Vieques," says Navy Lt.Costello, like many Gitmo types, is baffled at the uproar over the prisoners' treatment.It's understandable if public affairs types are a little testy."They're getting 2,600 calories a day.The bad news is that the unfounded rumor is founded--the Pentagon press corps is coming with him, and we'll be forced to leave a day early.Costello says their eight-by-eight cells contain about twice as much space as soldiers have in their crowded, unventilated tents a few hundred yards away.There's an obvious culture clash (military personnel don't get paid to ask why; journalists don't get paid otherwise).We are certainly interrogating the prisoners, though base sources won't divulge any information that's been gleaned.On my last day at Gitmo, all I have time to eat is a stale Ding Dong and a greasy plate of onion rings.
