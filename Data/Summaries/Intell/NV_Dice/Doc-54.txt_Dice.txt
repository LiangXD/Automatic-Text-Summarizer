By 2005, 50 per cent of Beijing's land, including both urban and rural areas, will have been covered with trees.A 200-metre belt of trees has been planted on each side of the Yongding, Chaobai, Dasha and Wenyu rivers, which was previously the city's most desertificated land.Private organizations are also being encouraged to help fight sandstorms, according to the administration's vice-director Li Yucai.The repeated breaching of the embankments of the Yongding and Chaobai rivers also resulted in the desertification of the land with heavy sand being deposited by floods.
