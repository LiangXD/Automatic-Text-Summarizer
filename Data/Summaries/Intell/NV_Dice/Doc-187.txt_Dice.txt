A number of bases have been established for the war veterans throughout Zimbabwe, particularly in those areas which did not have army camps.Authoritative military sources said the army will be training and arming war veterans to ensure that Mugabe is re-elected in the ballot which must be held by the end of March.These arms can in turn be re-sold by those other countries," said Sautier, adding that there was also the possibility of illegal arms trafficking outside the authority of the French government.The sources said the war veterans will operate from these bases, their main objective being to make it impossible for the MDC to campaign in rural areas.We have, for instance, sold arms to many French-speaking countries.The two said they had no knowledge of the arrival of French arms in the country but said France sold arms to several African countries which could in turn re-sell them to other countries.Most of the guns have been arriving secretly at Suri Suri airbase in Chegutu before they are distributed to other military bases and some will be sent to farms where self-styled war veterans have established bases to intimidate voters."Although we can still buy a number of arms from countries like Russia and China, a greater part of our fairly priced weapons, ammunition and spares have been sourced from mainly European countries like Britain, Sweden, France and others over the years.We can no longer buy arms from Europe at the moment because of the problems here," said a top Ministry of Defence source.Virtually all European Union member states have severed ties with Zimbabwe and imposed an arms embargo on the country.
