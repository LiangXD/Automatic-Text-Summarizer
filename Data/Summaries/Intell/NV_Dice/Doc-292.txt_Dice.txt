While Israel rejects the EU plan for political and economic reasons, the EU affirms its position of not recognizing the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as a legitimate part of Israel.Although High Contracting Parties to the Convention have affirmed the Convention's de jure applicability to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, Israel maintains its refusal to respect its obligations as an Occupying Power, which would include the dismantling of its illegal settlements in that Territory in addition to not exporting any products from them.In November of last year, the EU had issued a warning to European importers, specifying that Israeli exports originating in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as well as the Golan Heights were not included in the free trade agreement with Israel.
