He said the government had not been aware of the ruling by Bosnia's Human Rights Chamber that measures should be taken to stop four of the suspects being taken out of the country.A Bosnian government official said legal procedures had been respected in the case, but a senior UN human rights officer in Bosnia said they had been "trampled over."Earlier, the US embassy in Sarajevo said in a statement: "The six Algerian nationals who have been detained by BiH (Bosnia and Herzegovina) authorities since mid-October have been transferred to US custody.Bosnian authorities have handed over to US custody six Algerians detained in October on suspicion of involvement in terrorism but ordered released this week by a local court, the US embassy said on Friday.International officials said US officials had not been willing to provide Bosnia's justice system with the intelligence information that prompted their detention.All were Algerians, although one also had a Yemeni passport possibly obtained fraudulently, international officials said.Washington is already under fire from human rights groups for its treatment of prisoners captured in Afghanistan and held at Guantanamo Bay.The men had appealed against that decision, however, and Rees said they should not have been deported until that process was complete."It's very disappointing," Madeleine Rees, head of the Bosnia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said of the operation."The legal procedure in this case has been fully respected so far," said Jusif Halilagic, a deputy minister who represents the government in the chamber.
