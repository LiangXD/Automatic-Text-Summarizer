"Our officers are more concerned with doing Pentagon damage control concerning the detainees than looking after the troops."They're not pleased that the brass, the lawmakers and the press are more interested in the well-being of the detainees than the soldiers guarding them, and that they might as well be invisible."The Marine general here says we can have a beer when off duty, but our Army leadership is running so scared that it set a no-drinking policy," says another troop.Then, with a twinkle in his eyes, he adds: "Are they getting enough sleep, the right diet, enough prayer time?Maybe someday, do-gooders, editors, lawmakers and senior Army leaders will remember our soldiers are human beings with human rights, too, and get their side of the story."We are responsible enough to secure the prisoners, but not enough to have a beer."They get four hot meals a day, fresh fruit, regular issues of snacks such as sunflower seeds, regular clean clothes laundered by the Marine supply system," says another soldier.This time around, they've already bitten one of the soldiers guarding them and threatened to kill anybody else who gets too close.The Marines are right, the Army's wrong, and we're stuck in the middle."
