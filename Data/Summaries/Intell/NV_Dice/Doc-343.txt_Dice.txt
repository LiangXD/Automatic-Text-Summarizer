1999 PLANS At the Southern Command in Miami, the Pentagon's base for military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, spokesman Steve Lucas said planners had pulled out blueprints from April 1999 -- when the Clinton administration had briefly considered housing up to 20,000 refugees from the Kosovo conflict at the base.Cuban leader Fidel Castro has long argued that the U.S. military occupation of the base is illegal, while U.S. officials say the base exists under a lease agreement that was part of a 1934 treaty with Cuba.In this instance, military sources said, the number of prisoners would be much smaller -- perhaps in the dozens -- and the logistics would focus more on security at the 45-square-mile base and less on the comfort of prisoners who are considered either members of a terrorist network or supporters of terrorists.Guantanamo to hold terror prisoners The U.S. naval base at Guantamano Bay, Cuba, once a detention center for thousands of Cubans and Haitians seeking freedom in America, may soon become a prison for men with a radically different view of the country.The biggest challenge may be getting prisoners from South Asia to the Caribbean.The prisoners from Afghanistan are not expected to arrive for weeks, and Rumsfeld said there are no plans to stage military tribunals or trials at the base, which is home to about 1,100 members of the Navy and Marine Corps."All of this is pretty well-planned out because we have used it to house illegal migrant detainees in the past, Cubans and Haitians," Lucas said.The base is extremely isolated."It gives new life to Gitmo," as the base is often called.Because the base is not on U.S. soil, people detained there are not entitled to American residency and eventual citizenship privileges.Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami, said she supported the idea, in part, because it would underscore the naval base's strategic importance at a time when some members of Congress have urged returning the territory to Cuba.
