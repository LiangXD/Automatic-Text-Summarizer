Although the islands saw little action, as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power.The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified cities, but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders.Cycladic Culture At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the Cyclades islands.The Persian Wars As Athens rose in influence and power in the West, it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire.The struggle bypassed most of the islands, although there was fierce fighting on Samos.By the time of the Crusades, many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated.While Byzantine land was being divided, there was no one in control of the seas, so pirates raided towns on many of the islands.After the war, in 1949, the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation.An important early material, obsidian, was discovered on the island of Milos.Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands, the next major power change brought influence from the West.Santorini (Thira), the next major island north, was heavily influenced by Crete, and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time.In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval, the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans (at around 1300 b.c. ), who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland.Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors, who were led by Philip II of Macedon.The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state.The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean Islands, which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade.Finally, Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor, which became part of the new Turkish state.The Turks lost a short war with Italy, and were forced to relinquish the Dodecanese islands to the Italians.The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen, many of whom were Genoese or Venetian, such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos.The Persians were defeated, and Athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it.The island communities were undecided about which side to back for a time.The Ottoman Empire was weakening, however, and in 1821, the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time.Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories.However, Greece was not yet a country; each city-state was self-governing and autonomous.Later, in 454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age.The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism, and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp, cool summers.Greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of Asia Minor, which for over 2,000 years had had a substantial Greek population.
