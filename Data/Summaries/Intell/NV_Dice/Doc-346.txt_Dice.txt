U.S. and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport and energy companies are expected collectively to lose billions of dollars if lawmakers approve President Eduardo Duhalde's controversial economic package.MOST DEBT IN DOLLARS More than 80 percent of personal debt in Argentina is in dollars, and most of that debt is held by the middle class.Foreign firms furiously lobby in Argentina BUENOS AIRES -- Foreign multinational companies trying to avoid billions in losses furiously lobbied Argentine lawmakers and the new government ahead of today's final vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the U.S. dollar.Foreign companies that took over former state transportation, phone and energy companies want -- but appear unlikely to get -- some form of indexing so they can raise their prices to compensate for what is expected to be a widening gap between the peso and dollar.U.S. companies had investments totaling more than $16 billion in Argentina through 1999, according to the State Department.Argentina is now broke.It attracted much foreign investment in the 1990s because companies were promised that their profits in pesos would always be worth the same in dollars.The companies are worried by Duhalde's proposal to devalue the peso and scrap a policy known as convertibility that kept the peso's worth the same as a U.S. dollar."If it is successful in Argentina, it could become a reference," said Eduardo Curia, an independent economist in Buenos Aires.Foreign companies are also trying to reverse a portion of the emergency package that proposes to end a decade of billing in dollars at the gas pump, or for fixed and cellular phone services, water and power bills and the like.The economic package nonetheless was passed by Argentina's lower house late Saturday night and is expected to gain easy passage through the Senate today.
