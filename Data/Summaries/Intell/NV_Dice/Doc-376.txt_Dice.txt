But he said that he disagreed with the decision by the fund and the Bush administration to continue the aid program in August, when he said the situation in Argentina had likely deteriorated beyond repair.Moreover, it is difficult to place blame for Argentina's economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy was designed by Argentina itself, sometimes over the objections of the fund's economists.When Argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, Bush administration officials did not take a firm position, allowing the I.M.F. to make the call on withholding additional loans, people involved in the fund's deliberations said."If Argentina got its core economic policies right, it would have avoided this problem," said Charles Calomiris, a finance and economics professor at Columbia University who has been sounding the alarm about Argentina for months.21 - The deadly riots in Argentina, the collapse of its government and another multibillion dollar bailout gone awry have raised fresh questions about the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund and the financial policies of the United States, the fund's leading shareholder.Even the harshest critics of the I.M.F. put most of the blame for Argentina's current plight on a succession of governments in Buenos Aires.But many say the monetary fund should have called government officials to account sooner.The French, who like the United States are significant fund shareholders, have called on the lending agency to step up its involvement to help Argentina recover.At an August meeting at I.M.F. headquarters, fund officials told Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, that the country would be better off delaying debt payments.The fund decided to suspend aid for a program that appeared to have little chance of success.These criticisms, even if contradictory, increase pressure on the I.M.F. and the Bush administration to articulate a clear policy toward financial rescue efforts, which often come under fire even when they are judged successful.Michael Mussa, the I.M.F.'s chief economist until last spring, said the fund was justified in providing aid to Argentina late last year.Backed by both the Clinton and Bush administrations, the I.M.F. twice came to the rescue, beginning late last year.But he argued that by delaying, the fund helped Argentina dig itself into a deeper hole."The fund is partly to blame for this because the fund did not sound the alarm in time and then took a very hard line when things were incredibly difficult," he told Peruvian radio.Peru's finance minister, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, complained today that the fund bungled its dealings with Argentina by adopting inconsistent policies that were at turns passive and inflexible.
