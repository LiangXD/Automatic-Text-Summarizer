SubHead: Backbenchers protest: Eggleton tells MPs to remember the real issue: Sept.11 Author: Sheldon Alberts OTTAWA - Canadian troops will hand over any enemy fighters they capture to the Americans, Art Eggleton said yesterday, dismissing concerns from Liberal backbenchers about the treatment of Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners by the U.S. military.Mr. Godfrey said it is unacceptable for Canada to allow any ambiguity in policy toward the U.S. treatment of prisoners.One possible policy, he said, would be for Canadian troops operating with members of the U.S.JTF-2 members have not yet taken any prisoners in Afghanistan but they have been on missions in which prisoners were taken, Mr. Eggleton said.Mr. Godfrey said, "When I see those hooded prisoners being put on planes to Cuba, I say to myself, 'Would we allow that, if Canadian troops were taken?'"We do not have detention facilities and our intent would be to turn them over," Mr. Eggleton said.Still, Mr. Eggleton said Canada wants further clarification on how the tribunals that judge the prisoners will comply with international law.101st Airborne Regiment to simply defer to the Americans when prisoners are being taken.Mr. Eggleton said there is no evidence U.S. authorities have failed to provide humane care, and he said U.S. commanders have assured Canada they will follow international law.The U.S. commanders consider the prisoners to be "unlawful combatants" as opposed to prisoners of war, a distinction that allows the U.S. to provide different treatment under international law.Ms. Jennings, a Montreal MP, demanded assurances that Canadian soldiers will not turn over any prisoners unless the U.S. guarantees they will not face the death penalty.Human rights groups have criticized the U.S. military's treatment of prisoners captured during its current cleanup operation in southern Afghanistan.
