Yeom Yoon-jeong SEOUL 1997-03-31 South Korea's ailing won shot up 2.25 percent against the dollar on Monday after the government announced steps to open stock and bond markets wider to foreigners .The won has fallen about 13 percent against the dollar since the beginning of last year , pushed lower by a ballooning current account deficit .After the stock market closed , the government announced it would raise the foreign stock holding ceiling to 23 percent of a listed firm from the current 20 percent , effective from May 1 ."_ I doubt if foreign funds will really flow in as much as the government estimates , _" said an economist at the Korea Institute of Finance , who declined to be identified .The government would also allow domestic financial institutions to raise funds in Asia and Europe for investment in the local bond market this year .But economists and dealers said they did not believe Monday's announcements would have a fundamental impact on the won ."_ Why should the won strengthen , when the dollar continues to rise in world markets ? _"In a further move to bring in more overseas capital and shore up the won , the ministry said it would expand overseas borrowings by state banks .The yield on three-year benchmark corporate bonds closed at 12.50 percent , down from 12.66 percent on Saturday ."_ It_ 's important to confirm the government's firm intention not to stand idly by the won's sharp depreciation , _" said Lee Chang-seon , economist at LG Economic Research Institute .
