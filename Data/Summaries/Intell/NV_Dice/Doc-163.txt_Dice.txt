"The cargo ship Nisha was intercepted and boarded as part of an intelligence-led operation.A cargo ship intercepted in the Channel after a tip-off that it might be carrying terrorist materials was today given the all clear, police said.But after a detailed examination of the ship, which is currently moored off the Isle of Wight, nothing suspicious was found, police said.The Nisha's cargo of raw sugar is owned by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, which had chartered the vessel, and the vessel was due to dock in east London yesterday."We had anticipated that detailed examination of the ship might take rather longer.The ship had sailed from Mauritius and was carrying a cargo of sugar to the Tate &amp;amp; Lyle refinery on the Thames at Silvertown in east London, according to the company.Thankfully, the ship has been proved not to pose a danger to the public."Mr Veness said the ship was now in a position to continue its journey, but completion of the voyage was still subject to consultation with all interested parties.
