This increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by industrialized nations.As a reminder, Dr. Ren pointed out: The Kyoto Protocol is merely a gesture for mankind to stop global warming.China's per capita emission is only one-sixth that of the United States.There is no way for a weak, developing nation to absorb such a burden.If emission of greenhouse gases is not rigorously limited and is allowed to continue to climb, then the average global temperature may surge by 1.5 to 5.8 C.In certain regions, the temperature may rise suddenly and sharply.According to this expert, the United States is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting country in the world.Furthermore, on a per capita basis, emissions by developing nations are also far less than that by industrialized nations.To implement the Kyoto Protocol, according to Dr. Ren, usually a country would incur an economic loss equivalent to 1 percent of its GDP when it tries to lower greenhouse emissions 1 percent.This disaster can only be averted if we all join in to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to stop global warming.He also pointed out: Although the Kyoto Protocol did not set a reduction target for China, however, China is very concerned about global climate change-related issues in recent years.
