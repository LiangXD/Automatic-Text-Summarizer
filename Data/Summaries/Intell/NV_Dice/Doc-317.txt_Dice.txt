"They're just chilling out, that's exactly what they're doing," said Staff Sgt Chuck Albrecht."Sometimes you're afraid for your life because these people are trained to kill you," said Specialist Fabian Rivas.There are jokes at Camp X-Ray but the sense of danger is ever present.The detainees' toothbrushes are shortened so that they cannot be used as weapons.Like most Marines and MPs making up the 1,200-strong force, Staff Sgt Albrecht is angry at accusations that the detainees have been mistreated.Such incidents have been rare, however, and most of the camp's 158 Muslim fanatics are compliant, the guards say."The conditions my men live in are very similar to those of the detainees," said Col Terry Carrico.When the detainees wanted water, they got water, said Staff Sgt Monte Webster, an MP.The detainees are washing every day.There are holes in them, but for now the problem is the stifling heat.At the camp, Marine engineers saw and hammer away as an interrogation centre and new cages are finished.The detainees may be shackled, even as they are operated on at the Gitmo hospital, but they have brand new copies of the Koran and Lively Salon anti-dandruff shampoo that promises "a gentle formula to restore moisture to your beautiful clean hair".The Marines live in an encampment 100 yards from Camp X-Ray's gates.So do the American soldiers, at Cuba's only McDonald's restaurant or the all-ranks bars where popcorn and pizzas are the only fare.If I let it get to me I would have a very hard time doing my job."
