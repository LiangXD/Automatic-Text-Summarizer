No Arab leader was in any doubt that from Sharon's standpoint the resolution was not welcome.It cannot solve the Israeli people's security problems, because the root of the terrorism is the Israeli occupation and the Israeli settlements on occupied territory.As a first step Israeli forces were sent into the main Palestinian town, Ramallah, where Arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous Palestinian areas are administered.For the time being at least the United States has thus given Sharon a free hand.Sharon is a master of escalation.The resolution that was put forward by Saudi Arabia was a plea addressed to the Israeli people over the heads of Ariel Sharon's government.According to these sources, Sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while Arafat hesitated.On Thursday the summit adopted a resolution that proposed the recognition of the Jewish state, normal relations, and an end to the conflict in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that Israel has occupied for almost 35 years.Now he declared that Arafat was an "enemy."Prior to the Natanya massacre Washington had imposed a number of limitations on Sharon.The summit's declaration was the best piece of news the Middle East has produced since the Oslo Accords between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat were signed on the lawn in front of the White House in Washington in 1993.It is likely that at present Sharon is entertaining similar thoughts and wants to create step by step a situation that will make it possible for him to rid himself of his enemy.His name figured on a list that Israel had shortly before handed over to the Palestinian security service.The settlers, who number around 220,000 people, have taken the Israeli Government and consequently both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples hostage.
