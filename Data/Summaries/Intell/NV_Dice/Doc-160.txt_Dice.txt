This committee is scheduled to start the debate on the Senate's euthanasia bill today.The Chamber will treat the bill differently than the Senate, which worked with a joint justice and public health committee.Moreover, the Chamber's justice committee seems to want to go it alone regarding the euthanasia debate.The Chamber apparently wants to push ahead with the debate on euthanasia because available speaking time is very limited.
