He also said that agreements with as many as nine foreign carriers across the globe had already been signed."The present rate cut of up to 40 percent on peak-time rates is likely to be lowered after Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) and the other ILD operators, who are yet to begin services, announce their rates.Carriers will now connect to Bharti's network and enjoy rates that will enable them to offer deep discounts to the end-consumer."Bharti, after requisite clearances, will offer its network to all carriers on a non-discriminatory basis.Unlike the STD [subscriber trunk dialing] services where a further rate cut may not be feasible, in the international services there is scope for more improvement," he said.
