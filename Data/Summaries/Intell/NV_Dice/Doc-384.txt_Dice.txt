US State Department spokeswoman Lynn Cassel said: 'While we must wait for the final results, it is abundantly clear that this was a seriously flawed election.''The election was preceded by months of government-orchestrated violence meant to intimidate voters (and) the opposition was repeatedly harassed and prevented from campaigning,' she said.As the results were being announced, about 100 heavily armed soldiers moved into Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayao and surrounded the MDC offices, where opposition officials had gathered.Registrar General Tobaiwa Mudede announced on state television that Mugabe was re-elected with 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,758 votes for Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).Mugabe wins poll, amid claims of rigging HARARE, March 13 (AFP) - Zimbabwe's long-time ruler Robert Mugabe swept to victory Wednesday in Presidential elections in a vote that challenger Morgan Tsvangirai declared was rigged and unacceptable.The influential International Crisis Group (ICG) warned that the 'risk of major violence erupting is exceedingly high' if the election was seen to be rigged.The MDC leadership was due to meet later Wednesday to discuss the poll results, and Tsvangirai was due to address a media conference afterwards.Turnout across the southern African country was an estimated 66 per cent in an election fraught by violence, intimidation and intense legal wrangling over civic rights and electoral rules.British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw cited 'pretty strong' evidence that Mugabe has 'stolen' Zimbabwe's vote, an outcome he said would have 'enormous implications for the nature of our relationship with Zimbabwe.'Tsvangirai rejected Mugabe's election victory out of hand.
