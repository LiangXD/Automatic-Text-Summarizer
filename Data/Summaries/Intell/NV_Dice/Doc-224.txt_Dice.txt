According to the White House, this should make it possible to reduce "the intensity of greenhouse gas emission generated by the US economy" by 18% over the next 10 years, an objective described by the Bush Administration as "comparable" to that imposed by the Kyoto Protocol.President George W. Bush considered, moreover, that it would be "irresponsible" not to ask India and China to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.US President George W. Bush presented 14 February his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which is designed to slow down global warming.He asserted, in an allusion to the binding objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, that it would be "unjust and counterproductive to condemn developing countries to weak or even nonexistant economic growth by insisting that they adopt unrealistic greenhouse gas reduction targets."The White House hastened to describe the Bush plan as "the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions."For the moment Mr. Bush simply proposes to curb the increase in harmful gas emissions and is counting on the good will of US industrialists, who account for 36% of the greenhouse gas produced by industrialized countries (as opposed to 31.6% for Europe).The White House hastened to describe the Bush plan as "the most audacious program in American history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions," considering that it would be possible to save the administration up to $1 billion, compared to the costs that binding rules would lead to.Contrary to the preceding one, the plan proposed by Washington Thursday thus no longer has any binding procedure and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives.
