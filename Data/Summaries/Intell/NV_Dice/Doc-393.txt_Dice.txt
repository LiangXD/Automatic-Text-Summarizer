Navy Officer Balances Religious Responsibilities Miami Herald January 31, 2002 Navy Officer Balances Religious Responsibilities By Carol Rosenberg GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba -- You're the first-ever American Muslim cleric to minister to a prison camp full of suspected terrorists and one confides he has a weapon."I don't have any answer for them," he says.So far no one has asked him how a practicing Muslim can also wear the uniform of the U.S. armed forces.Until he emerged as the chaplain of choice for this special assignment from among only 14 Muslim clerics in the U.S. armed forces, he was the only cleric specifically assigned to a Marine Corps base -- at Camp Pendleton, Calif.Captives at Camp X-ray are entitled to spiritual solace, he says, even though he doesn't accept radical interpretations that have led them to an unorthodox battlefield against the so-called Great Satan, the United States.Saiful-Islam is by training an imam, or a prayer leader, who guides the faithful in a mosque during the five-times-a-day Muslim prayer.At Camp X-ray, he is also serving the function of a muezzin, the person who announces the call to prayer, commonly from a tower called a minaret."These things are hard to find in America, and Gitmo is far, far away," says Saiful-Islam, a husband and father of a nearly 2-year-old daughter in California.Military recruiters building a Muslim chaplains corps spotted Saiful-Islam in 1993, while he was an enlisted man working as a payroll clerk in the Pentagon and studying part-time to become a Muslim cleric.Saiful-Islam has also asked for some copies of the Koran, in Urdu, a language of Afghanistan and Pakistan, plus large-type, Arabic copies for those with bad eyesight or those who read like elementary school children."If they don't trust me with their needs, they don't get it," he says, with a sigh."I, of course, don't agree with their cause," he says, "and neither does the religion, Islam."
