It will not be a "coup" so long as the United States thinks it is not!Why has the United States been picking on Chavez and Bustani all this time?After Chavez took office as Venezuelan president, he has pursued an independent foreign policy, and has been out of step with the United States in many areas.When questioned by a reporter "why the United States has supported a certain cold-blooded dictator in Latin America," Roosevelt gave a vivid reply: This dictator "may be a son of bitch, yet he is our (the United States) son of bitch."Even some major media in the United States have thoroughly unmasked the attitude taken by the US Government towards the cope farce in Venezuela.
