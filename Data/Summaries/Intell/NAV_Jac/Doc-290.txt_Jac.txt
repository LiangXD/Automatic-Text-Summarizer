"We say they should be presumed to be POWs, and it is not up to the ICRC or to the US military authorities to decide, but up to the courts," said Michael Kleiner, an ICRC spokesman.Under the third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war may only be tried in the same courts and according to the same rules, as soldiers of the country that is holding the prisoners.Under the Geneva Conventions, POWs must be returned home at the end of the war.Human rights organizations, however, have raised questions about the prisoners' housing conditions, which according to the Geneva Convention should be the same standard of those enjoyed by their guards.That means the Al Qaeda suspects could not be tried in the special military tribunals whose rules are currently being worked out, but only by regular US military courts using the Uniform Code of Military Justice."This is one reason why the Americans are nervous about applying the POW convention in all its glory," says Adam Roberts, an expert on international law at Oxford University in England, and editor of "Documents on the Laws of War."US officials say that the foreign prisoners captured in Afghanistan are not covered by the third Geneva Convention because they were "bands of people that I don't think would meet the criteria of organized military activity," as Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hanson put it.Rather, it appears to be sidestepping the conventions in order to craft an unusual legal strategy that will enable it to try Al Qaeda suspects in special US military tribunals."What is worrying," adds Prof. Roberts, "is that by calling these people 'battlefield detainees', the United States seems to be creating a legal limbo where it is not clear what the legal standards are."US military engineers are preparing to build up to 2,000 such cells, if necessary; more than 400 prisoners are still being held in Afghanistan.That description severely reduces the rights that the men would have as POWs under the Geneva Conventions, and prompted a rebuttal from the International Red Cross.
