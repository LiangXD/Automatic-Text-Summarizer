Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, said Canadarm2 has so far performed flawlessly in its pivotal role installing the truss segment.The rail car is part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, the centerpiece of what is to be a 120-metre girder running the length of the space station.The arm was then used for the first time to move the spacewalking astronauts to different work sites around the newly installed truss.The 18-metre arm, which is powerful enough to lift entire station modules, was also rewired so it could draw power through the S-0 truss.The massive robotic arm, Canada's contribution to the multi-national space station, lifted the truss segment out and away from the shuttle's cargo bay and attached it on the station's laboratory module."Canadarm2 is a unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment," said Capt.The small trolley is designed to roll the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another as work progresses on the station over the next several years.
