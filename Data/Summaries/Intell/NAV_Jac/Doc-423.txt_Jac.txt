administration eventually determine that it had been involved in the 9/11 attacks.President Bush directed Secretary of State Powell to deliver an ultimatum to the Taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed.President Bush told Bob Woodward that the decision not to invade Iraq was made at the morning session on September 15."Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with," Powell told us.Secretary Powell said the United States had to make it clear to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Arab states that the time to act was now.While the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington, by the time Air Force One was airborne at 9:55 A.M. the Secret Service, the President's advisers, and Vice President Cheney were strongly advising against it."PHASE TWO" AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein's regime might have had a hand in it.Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for 11 years, and was the only place in the world where the United States was engaged in ongoing combat operations.When Blair asked about Iraq, the President replied that Iraq was not the immediate problem.Franks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on military responses in Iraq during the summer before 9/11-a request President Bush denied, arguing that the time was not right.Rice said President Bush began the meeting with the words, "We're at war," and that Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said the agency was still assessing who was responsible, but the early signs all pointed to al Qaeda.That afternoon, Secretary of State Powell announced at the beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had agreed to every U.S. request for support in the war on terrorism.President Bush instructed Rumsfeld and Shelton to develop further the Camp David military plan to attack the Taliban and al Qaeda if the Taliban rejected the ultimatum.In this restricted National Security Council meeting, the President said it was a time for self-defense.President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central Command's General Franks and other advisers on September 21 and October 2.It began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the flowing losses to the American economy, such as Organizing federal emergency assistance.At the September 17 NSC meeting, there was some further discussion of "phase two" of the war on terrorism.President Bush also tasked the State Department, which on the following day delivered to the White House a paper titled "Game Plan for a Political-Military Strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan."In the first meeting, he stressed that the United States was at war with a new and different kind of enemy.PLANNING FOR WAR By late in the evening of September 11, the President had addressed the nation on the terrible events of the day.Franks said that President Bush again turned down the request.The State Department was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize Pakistan and to be prepared to notify Russia and countries near Afghanistan when hostilities were imminent.The President blamed al Qaeda for 9/11 and the 1998 embassy bombings and, for the first time, declared that al Qaeda was "responsible for bombing the USS Cole."President Bush ordered the Defense Department to be ready to deal with Iraq if Baghdad acted against U.S. interests, with plans to include possibly occupying Iraqi oil fields.The Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart.But the early briefings to the President and Secretary Rumsfeld on military options were disappointing.He also had a message for those outside the United States.President Bush argued that the new war went beyond Bin Ladin.At 8:30 that evening, President Bush addressed the nation from the White House.The pre-9/11 draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive, National Security Presidential Directive 9, now titled "Defeating the Terrorist Threat to the United States."President Bush later praised this proposal, saying it had been a turning point in his thinking.Tommy Franks, the commanding general of Central Command (CENTCOM), told us that the President was dissatisfied.The President also tasked Rumsfeld to ensure that robust measures to protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented worldwide.Though continuing to worry about Iraq in the following week, Powell said, President Bush saw Afghanistan as the priority.Secretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitz-not Rumsfeld-argued that Iraq was ultimately the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked.All these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of September 15-16, as President Bush convened his war council at Camp David.In Phase Two, air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al Qaeda and Taliban targets.Rice told us the administration was concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the 9/11 attacks.On September 13, President Bush promised to provide $20 billion for New York City, in addition to the $20 billion his budget director had already guessed might be needed for the country as a whole.At the September 13 NSC meeting, when Secretary Powell described Pakistan's reply, President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban.It argued that of the three, al Qaeda and Iraq posed a strategic threat to the United States.(2) Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals?On the same day, Deputy Secretary of State Armitage was called by Mahmud Ahmed regarding a two-day visit to Afghanistan during which the Pakistani intelligence chief had met with Mullah Omar and conveyed the U.S. demands.The President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban, step back, wait to see if they got the message, and hit them hard if they did not.Speculating about other possible states that could be involved, the President told us he also thought about Iran.Powell said that President Bush did not give Wolfowitz's argument "much weight."The U.S. military, Franks said, did not have an off-the-shelf plan to eliminate the al Qaeda threat in Afghanistan.Having issued directives to guide his administration's preparations for war, on Thursday, September 20, President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session of Congress.After emphasizing that the first priority was to help the injured and protect against any further attacks, he said: "We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them."The government's ability to collect intelligence inside the United States, and the sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement communities, was not a priority before 9/11.Powell said that Wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that Iraq was behind 9/11.Rice prepared a paper that President Bush then considered with principals on Monday morning, September 17.The President completed his statement, which for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live, and the traveling party returned to Air Force One.The CENTCOM commander told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi moves shortly after 9/11, both because he personally felt that Iraq and al Qaeda might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that Saddam might take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern or southern parts of Iraq, where the United States was flying regular missions to enforce Iraqi no-fly zones.Some members of his administration, he commented, had expressed a different view, but he was the one responsible for making the decisions.Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks, joined the discussion.Flights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States Three questions have arisen with respect to the departure of Saudi nationals from the United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11: (1) Did any flights of Saudi nationals take place before national airspace reopened on September 13, 2001?Secretary Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might have harbored the attackers, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, and Iran.INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist connections; in the chaos after the attacks, it was very difficult to reach law enforcement officials, who were following up on other leads.President Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September 12.The next destination was discussed: once again the Secret Service recommended against returning to Washington, and the Vice President agreed.The President added that America's quarrel was not with Islam: "The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends.But, he told us, he now wondered how that action was connected to what might need to be done in Somalia, Yemen, or Iraq.The plan had four phases.In Phase Three, the United States would carry out "decisive operations" using all elements of national power, including ground troops, to topple the Taliban regime and eliminate al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan."While he believed the details of Clarke's account to be incorrect, President Bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to Clarke at some point, asking him about Iraq.The memo found no "compelling case" that Iraq had either planned or perpetrated the attacks.The President had a message for the Pentagon: "The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make us proud."She recalled that in the first Camp David session chaired by the President, Rumsfeld asked what the administration should do about Iraq.
