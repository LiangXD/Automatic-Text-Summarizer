State Department officials this week accused Mugabe's government of numerous human rights violations during the election campaign, an allegation vehemently denied by ZANU-PF officials.Government officials last month charged Tsvangirai and two other officials of his party with high treason for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe.Tsvangirai said at a news conference Thursday night that if he won the election, he would not prosecute Mugabe.ZANU-PF officials have told election observers that they intend to increase the number of polling stations in rural areas believed to be their strongholds and reduce the number of stations in urban areas, where there is strong support for the opposition.Political analysts say the charges may have laid the groundwork for Mugabe to jail Tsvangirai as a last-ditch effort to stay in power should he lose the election.That charge is based largely on a heavily edited videotape in which Tsvangirai refers to the "elimination" of Mugabe."Clearly, Mugabe is doing everything he can to steal this election," said John Makumbe, a political science professor at the University of Zimbabwe.Observers say that could produce long voting lines and discourage some Tsvangirai supporters from casting ballots.In addition, governing party officials have revised election laws and procedures in a manner that could change the outcome of the vote, according to independent election observers."If Mugabe announces that he has won the election, I think that people will not believe it and will storm the castle," said Sibongile Mbuyiso, an opposition supporter.
