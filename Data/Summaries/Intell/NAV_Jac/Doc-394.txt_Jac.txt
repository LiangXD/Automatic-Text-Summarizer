America's treatment of the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists at Camp X-Ray is appropriate and, in my opinion, too good for these murderous thugs.15 Stretching The Case For Inhumanity Terrorist thugs at Gitmo don't deserve their treatment By Vito Fossella Having had the opportunity to tour Camp X-Ray last week, I offer America's critics a simple piece of advice: Get a life.At Guantanamo Bay, federal officials are conducting extensive interviews with the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists, culling information on the terrorist network and the whereabouts and future plans of the tens of thousands of terrorists who were trained in the same camps and who are now living around the world.They have even demanded upgraded accommodations, seemingly forgetting that these are the leaders of a worldwide terrorist organization who have repeatedly vowed to kill innocent Americans through war or terror.Instead of lecturing the United States, our critics may better spend their time reminding others that if terrorists don't want to be detained at Camp X-Ray, they should join the civilized world.Far from being treated inhumanely, the al Qaeda and the Taliban terrorists are better fed, better clothed and better cared for than they would be if they were still roaming the cold caves of Afghanistan.Indeed, since their arrival at Camp-X-Ray, some of the terrorists have openly threatened the Marines who guard them and talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing the American people.
