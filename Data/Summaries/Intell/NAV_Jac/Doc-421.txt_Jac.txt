For the next 19 years, Jerusalem was two cities.The planned new Roman city, Aelia Capitolina, was built over the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem, and Jews were barred from residing there for all time.Jews were evacuated from the Old City' s Jewish Quarter, and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem.The ruins of Jerusalem were briefly liberated, but, in the end, Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss of life.The Second Temple was finished in 515 b.c. , but much of the city still lay in ruins.In 629, Jerusalem was recaptured by the Byzantines.Biblical Jerusalem In the Bible, Genesis 14:18 -- 20 records that Abraham visited the city of "Salem" in approximately 1800 b.c. and was blessed by the city' s ruler, Melchzedik, who offered him bread and wine.The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed.Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times.However, with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire, no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem.In 1947 the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with Jerusalem as an international city that belonged to neither.Jesus' s entry into the Temple caused a commotion; after the Passover dinner he was arrested by the temple priests, who were under direct Roman rule.Christian and Islamic Jerusalem For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins, until the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to Jupiter.30 he and his followers went for Passover to Jerusalem, which was in unrest at this time, dissatisfied with Roman domination.19th-Century Aspirations At the same time, many Jews sought religious freedom and fulfillment by moving to Palestine (as the Holy Land was traditionally called) and especially to Jerusalem.But Arab opposition to new Jewish immigration and construction in Palestine led to increasing strife; by 1946, Jerusalem was an armed camp.There the Ark rested until it was placed in the Temple, built in approximately 960 b.c. on Mt. Moriah, the high point at the northern end of the city.At the beginning of the second millennium b.c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route, far less important than biblical cities such as Hazor, Megiddo, Beth Shean, and Shechem.As a result of armistice agreements in 1949, Jerusalem was divided: West Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control, and East Jerusalem (including the Old City, with its Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters) came under Jordanian authority.Within three days the city was completely in Israeli hands, and in two weeks it was physically and administratively reunited.She found that the city' s most beautiful Roman temple, dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite, stood on the site of the crucifixion.Throughout Jerusalem, other spots important to Jesus' s life were commemorated with religious structures." In time, the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b.c.
