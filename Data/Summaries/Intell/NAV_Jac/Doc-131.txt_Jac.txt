This is because the Palestinians were, and still are, hoping that the Americans would realize, if they have not already realized, the justice of the Palestinian cause and the enormous injustice suffered by the Palestinians, who were expelled from their homeland, whose land was occupied, and who were deprived of the minimum political and human rights.If any people are going to be moved by the scenes of destruction that involved Manhattan, the World Trade Center, and the Pentagon, it is the Palestinian people.This is because Israel is an occupation state, one that is persecuting the Palestinians and denying them the right to exercise their national and sovereign rights.However, for Israel to take advantage of the US tragedy to claim that it is standing in one ditch with the United States against the violence of terrorism, this is a twisted logic.
