Last spring the American National Academy of Science warned that because "there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally," any estimates of either the magnitude or the direction of future warming must be highly tentative.The fact is, Kyoto is without principles and no one has a clue what it means.In short, because the estimates of the scale and timing of atmospheric warming are so uncertain, it is just not possible to assess the costs and benefits.Implementing Kyoto would cost a paltry $500-million, he said, and added more ominously that "the issue, technically, is that international relations fall within the purview of the federal government.Lorne Taylor, the Alberta Environment Minister, estimated the costs of Kyoto to the Canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year.Taylor may have offered a more prudent guess, but the fact is, accurate estimates of the costs of policies designed to reduce selected gas emissions are impossible.According to Jean Chretien, "the desire of the federal government is to sign it."Finally, vast uncertainty is built into computer models of climate change.Swelling the population of envirocrats in Ottawa means that the sole beneficiary is the federal government.There are two levels to the controversy around Kyoto.
