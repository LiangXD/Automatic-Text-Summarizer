We believe there is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community as a whole.We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people can grow and develop well.McCoy has only one interest: the well being of Marion County's young people.In the last several years, the business and corporate community has recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to the development of a competent workforce.
