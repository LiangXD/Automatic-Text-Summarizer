As a reminder, Dr. Ren pointed out: The Kyoto Protocol is merely a gesture for mankind to stop global warming.This increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by industrialized nations.This disaster can only be averted if we all join in to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to stop global warming.If emission of greenhouse gases is not rigorously limited and is allowed to continue to climb, then the average global temperature may surge by 1.5 to 5.8 C.This excessive emission of greenhouse gases has caused the mean global temperature to rise by 0.4 to 0.8 degree C in the past 140 years.China's per capita emission is only one-sixth that of the United States.In certain regions, the temperature may rise suddenly and sharply.Furthermore, on a per capita basis, emissions by developing nations are also far less than that by industrialized nations.Fundamentally, the targets set by the Kyoto Protocol are far less than what actually will take to effectively curb global warming.There is no way for a weak, developing nation to absorb such a burden.He indicated that there is a long way to go and a great deal of effort to put in before global warming can be successfully arrested.
