Under the Geneva Convention, those holding true POWs are bound to release them at the end of hostilities; but that is the last thing the U.S. wants to do with men who may be al-Qaeda operatives.The 110 al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners admitted to "Gitmo" by the end of last week are, said Rumsfeld, "the hardest of the hard core," men who had killed "dozens and dozens of people."That may be so; unfortunately, as Amnesty International has pointed out, under the Geneva Convention the Pentagon has no business making such a determination.Camp X-Ray It's not going to be a country club," said Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld last week, describing the new military detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and nobody ever expected it would be.The prisoners may be in Cuba, but nobody has yet forced them to listen to Fidel Castro's long-winded speeches.Three detainees are said to have claimed to be British citizens.Politicians and commentators in London are now clamoring that all held in Gitmo must be guaranteed treatment in accordance with international law.True, prisoners are now confined to 6-ft. by 8-ft. chain-link enclosures with concrete floors and tin roofs (Rumsfeld thinks it's "pejorative" to call them cages).The Pentagon has resisted calling the detainees prisoners of war, preferring the terms unlawful combatants or battlefield detainees.
