Without Kyoto, the figure would be 34%.While helping Third World nations plant new crops, vaccinate people and relocate coastal towns will be costly, the bottom line will likely be only a fraction of Kyoto's 13-digit price tag.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, world energy consumption will increase by about 60% between now and 2020, with most of the upsurge expected to come from developing nations, which are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol.As for the globally felt benefits that would follow from Canada's implementation of the Kyoto protocol, they are slight.Even if Canada managed to convince the United States and every other Kyoto signatory to ratify the protocol, world carbon dioxide emissions would still soar.But the $40-billion figure, far from being conceived to "frighten" Canadians, is plucked straight from government documents."There is nothing to be gained by frightening people when all the facts are not known."Governments are expected to protect the national economy, and they should deviate from that mission only when crucial national interests are at stake (fighting terrorism, for example).
