During this meeting, she has scheduled a meeting with peaceful antiglobalists, "but there is little I can do," she said in an interview."Therefore, it is a positive development that all 'summits' will be held in Brussels as of 2003," Neyts said.The WTO is accused of fostering trade anarchy.Neyts is a resolute defender of world trade and the World Trade Organization (WTO).International cooperation is slow and does not function optimally, but the alternatives are worse."There is an immense gulf between the hype surrounding a summit and its result, which is often worded in illegible conclusions.That is not what it is all about.""And this is not only a feeling.This is even worse in the case of G-8 meetings."There is not one developing country that wants to link social regulations to WTO regulations."The current protest movement is still in a phase that we called contestation in 1968.Moreover, the WTO is a young and small organization, and not a cold monster as some people are depicting it."To do this, regulations and a structure like the WTO are needed.His timing is right.Neyts is convinced that gaining access to development is a much more complex phenomenon than is generally accepted.The protest movement is colored by leftist ideology.
