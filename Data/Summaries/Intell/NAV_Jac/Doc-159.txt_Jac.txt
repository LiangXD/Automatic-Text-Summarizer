The Swedish and US authorities are looking for people who might have been exposed to dangerous radiation, but there is no indication that the container started to leak in Sweden.The SSI is now attempting to trace people who could have been exposed to the radiation leak."It this information is correct, it means that fewer people will have been exposed to radiation," said Hans-Bertil Hakansson, Studsvik managing director and concern chief, to DN [Dagens Nyheter].According to all indications, the radioactive container sent from the nuclear technology firm Studsvik to the US did not leak during transport within Sweden.This is Sweden's most serious incident so far involving radiation."However, it is extremely unlikely that the leak occurred during the flight from Paris to Memphis," Hakansson said.
