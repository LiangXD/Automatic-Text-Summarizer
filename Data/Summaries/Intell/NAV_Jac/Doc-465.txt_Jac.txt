It will not be a "coup" so long as the United States thinks it is not!In simpler terms, the interests of the United States are always above everything else, not only above the sovereignty of other nations, but also above the so-called values of "democracy" and "human rights" that the US always likes to dwell on.Why has the United States been picking on Chavez and Bustani all this time?After Chavez took office as Venezuelan president, he has pursued an independent foreign policy, and has been out of step with the United States in many areas.All these are eyesores to the United States.
