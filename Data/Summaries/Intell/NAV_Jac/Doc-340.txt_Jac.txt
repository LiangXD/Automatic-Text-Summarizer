Russia disagrees with 'axis' remark MUNICH, Germany -- Russia's defense minister said Sunday that his country disagrees with the U.S. view of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil.""Well, we don't like some of your allies like Saudi Arabia or Gulf states who give finance to terrorism organizations," Ivanov said.Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino, meanwhile, said Sunday that his country would not support an attack on Iraq without "proven proof" that Baghdad is supporting al Qaeda, and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein dispatched a delegation to meet with European Union leaders in Spain.What the three states do share, it went on, is chilly relations with the United States.Ivanov said there was no evidence Belarus has sold arms to nations under sanction such as Iraq, though it did do business with nations not under sanctions such as Tajikistan, Angola and "even Gulf states."Sunday's final session also underscored the vast differences between the United States and Russia.President Bush described Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil" during his State of the Union address on Jan.
