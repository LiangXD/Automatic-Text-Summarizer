Since coming to power, Bush, proceeding from the US immediate interests, has also adopted the pragmatism and unilateralism position with regard to international treaties.Supported by the world, the United States launched the "war against terrorism" of this century.The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country's attitude toward it.Pragmatism is, in the first place, the United States' traditional policy.Bush said, "Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists" and "any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime."Bush stressed that the war is not only the "US war" but also a "world war."The United States views itself as a "major force of anti-terrorism," for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism.But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it.It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology.
