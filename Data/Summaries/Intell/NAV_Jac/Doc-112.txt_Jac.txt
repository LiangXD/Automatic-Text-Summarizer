Nevertheless, Taiwan heightened its diplomatic campaign through what Wang said was "parliamentarian" or "private diplomacy" to win recognition from Beijing's allies.He said the number of Thai politicians visiting Taiwan, especially members of Parliament, was increasing at an "unusual" rate.He said Beijing will maintain its pursuit of peaceful unification with Taiwan and welcomed the resumption of dialogue, bogged down since 1999.He said the decline in President Chen's popularity could be attributed to the drop in the number of people favouring independence.Last year there were 2.85 million Taiwanese visitors in China, he said.China's minister in charge of Taiwan affairs says Beijing will not resort to force to defend Taiwan despite the changing situation on the island, which he described as "our renegade province"."I believe less than 10 per cent of Taiwanese now favour independence," he said.
