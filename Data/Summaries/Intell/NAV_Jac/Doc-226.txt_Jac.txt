A report about settlement activity in Palestinian territories has confirmed that 36 new settlement sites--settlement enclaves--have been created since Sharon became Prime Minister of Israel less than a year ago.The report also noted that work on bypass roads continued at a rate faster than that of the government of Barak who gave free rein to settlement activities.He explained that Palestinian population centers were used as human shields for the protection of settlements, and that about 90 percent of the bombardments to which Palestinian population centers were subjected originated in settlements.He said: "There are two grave violations, the first concerns settlement building and the transfer of settlers to the Palestinian territories on which tens of settlements have been built.In addition, 102 mobile caravans were added to settlements and new settlement sites and more than 705 donums were added to existing settlements.In the Gaza Strip 1,051 donums were annexed to existing settlements, 32 new housing units were built, and work on 190 additional units was started.The report highlighted the damage caused to the agricultural sector as a result of settlement activity.The annual report published by the National Bureau for Defending Land and Resisting Colonization in cooperation with the International Solidarity Establishment for Human Rights said that the nuclei of 36 new settlements were established from March 2001 to the end of November 2001 in various parts of the West Bank.He explained that the intifadah has proved that the settlement battle is not over.He stressed that since the outbreak of the intifadah in 1987, 18 percent of all Palestinians martyred were killed by settlers.The second is Israel's enacting of laws that facilitate expropriating Palestinian land and settlement activity, a matter that is considered among the war crimes."
