Sheik Muhammad Saddak said himself that he's nominated for the position of the interior minister, and Sheik Nasr al- Fahdawi for the governor of Anbar, like the Americans promised him, and Abu Raghghal al-Dulaymi and others thank god, his was eliminated by the brothers inside the city of Baghdad, until now no one knows who killed him in Baghdad, with all that, our policy is to eliminate the heads of infidelity without any announcements.IN THE NAME OF GOD, MOST GRACIOUS MOST MERCYFUL So this is the reality we're living in al-Anbar in general, and Ramadi in particular, that is the head Sheiks of some tribes, and symbols of the Islamic Party, sat with the Americans in Jordan, and other places, to fight terrorism and its people.We have no problem with you saying for us to give the name of the person before killing him, but we owe god, this will only be a delay for us, and time is not on our side, and for you to say to kill him outside his city, sometimes it take months before the person leaves his city, like if it's in Baghdad for example, that's difficult, and time is not on our side, we waited to cut the heads of the renegades in Hit, then 130 renegades came out to us for the reason that we didn't destroy the Islamic Party there, but we're working on it, for example we didn't kill Nasr al-Fahdawi at his home in al-Sajriyah, but the guys waited for him until he got out of the Ramadi province.1- Sheik Nasr al-Fahdawi, Sheik of AlbuFahd tribe, was nominated to be the governor of Anbar, this man worked so hard fighting the (Tanzim)organization, with all he's got, from money to power, and reputation in Ramadi, so we tried this @ with him: First, we backed off during the elections, they had checkpoints, using tens of his tribesmen who started checking cars, they violated our brothers many times, they even announced it, then our brothers attacked the field leader, the brain behind people revolting at al-Anbar in AlbuFahd, so the brothers raided his house in the middle of the night wearing the national guards uniform and driving similar cars, they took him and killed him thank god.3- After our brothers killed three of the infidels in AlbuFahd, some of them claimed he's for Jihad, at the same time, protects with his soldiers the election centers, and encourages people to volunteers in the police force and the Iraqi army, and it was the second hit for Nasr al-Fahdawi.From what we saw, the damage caused by those erratic infidels (Tribes Sheiks, The Islamic Party) is more dangerous than the Shiites and the peaceful police as people call them.The Sheiks started teaching people about these ideas, this conspiracy is led by two sides, the first is the heads of the tribes, the second is the leaders of the Islamic Party and mosques speakers, so they announced their war on the Mujahidin, it increased during the elections for the new constitution, their danger was so great, that hundreds of people volunteered in the police and the army, and thousands of people participated in the elections, renouncing their religion, and listenning to the erratics.1- Sheik of al-Bubali tribe in al-Jazira, Sheik Sarhan, who's one of the traitors, and every time one of their traitors gets killed, he shows outrage and packs his tribe with their guns against the brothers, after the cleaning in AlbuFahd, the brothers killed three of the spies in his tribe, and for the first time there was no reaction against the brothers, but instead he came to them, asking for forgiveness, and he's ready to cooperate.Other groups pretends that they never killed an Iraqi or Sunni in particular, and that its goals are patriotic, what we know about our Jihad, that it's Jihad of faith, and what you stated over and over before my Sheik about the method of the group, and the honorable resistance in many of the speeches to our brothers and people, in fact Sheik we are joyous for forming the state council, although we say, to save this blessed work, which we pray to god that Islam and muslims would benefit from it, everyone should agree on our policy in the war against the renegade, without these restrictions we have at the state council.My Sheik, here's some of the events that happened in Ramadi:2- Sheik of Albu'Ubaid (Salah al-Dhari), who slaughtered thirty sheeps in one dinner party, where he invited heads and Sheiks of tribes in Ramadi, to encourage their youth to join the police and the national guard, and that's two days before the murder of Sheik Nasr al-Fahdawi, after that he announced his repentance at the mosque twice infront of Albu'Ubaid tribe, denouncing who joins the police and army, and sorry for all he's done, without any pressure or threats from the brothers, also the brothers didn't announce the claim for any of the killings.As for the heads of the Islamic Party, our brothers been monitoring them for so long, but ignored them during the elections, then their vicious role appeared, with their call to form police and army after the elections, we found that the main thinker behind the Party's ideas is Sheik Abd al-Ghafur al-Kubaysi the Imam and speaker of of al-Shafi'i mosque in Ramadi, and made his mosque the center of all the Party's meetings, with all that, he didn't stop fighting the brothers with his speeches at the mosque, so the brothers assasinated him near his house, after he left the mosque going home, and there was no reaction by the Islamic Party or people, except that they raised signs condemning the killing.Then there was a complete change of events than is was before thank god, cousins of Sheik Nasr came to the Mujahidin begging, announcing their repentance and innocense, saying we're with you, we'll do whatever you want.Second question: Why did we announce and started fighting the Shiites and police from the start, even thought most of the Jihadist sectors and the public didn't understand what we want, and didn't know the importance of starting with those, so what's the objection on killing and executing the Sheiks now and without a notice, with continiuing making people understand it, just like we did by killing the police then, were people satisfied with us?10- I case there was a tribe who's not obaying, and their renegade is abvious, the Mujahidin release a statement to expose them, with mass media, then do vicious military operations against them, so they would be a lesson to others.
