Jim Unruh, Unisys's president, said he is approaching next year with caution.That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said a month ago would be laid off.That, he said, is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business: It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to.In addition, Unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $100 million during the quarter, leaving it within $100 million of its goal of a reduction of $500 million by the end of the year.And Unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter.Unisys, whose revenue inched up 3.7% in the quarter to $2.35 billion from $2.27 billion in the year-earlier quarter, had an operating loss of about $30 million.Unisys said that should help it save $500 million a year in costs, again at the high end of the previously reported range of $400 million to $500 million.But the company said Friday that it had losses of $673.3 million through the first nine months, compared with earnings a year earlier of $382.2 million, or $2.22 a share fully diluted, as revenue inched up 1.4% to $7.13 billion from $7.03 billion.So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $2 a share from $3.Mr. Weil of Weil & Associates said he will remain at $1 a share for next year but said he wonders whether even that low target is at risk.
