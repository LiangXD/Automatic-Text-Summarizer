There are so many bacteria everywhere that picking out a GEM is a_bit like looking for a candle amongst Blackpool '_ s illumination .Once you have the GEMs on the polystyrene spheres they can be washed off and cultured for testing with catechol or other techniques .But the snag is that first you have to be able to recover the GEMs to culture them to do the catechol yellowing test .are almost certainly the lost GEMs .The beads plus GEM are recovered with a magnet .Suspended in water , only the GEM for which the antibodies were specific will attach to the beads .A second problem is that many bacteria living & bquo ; in the wild & equo ; are not always easy to culture in the laboratory .is essential because_of the risks involved in letting GEMs out_of the laboratory .So mt-2 '_ s purified pili and flagellae were injected into animals so that they rapidly produced antibodies specific to them .So_far , none are known to have been released in the UK .To develop a recovery method , Morgan , Saunders and Pickup used a Gem called Pseudomonas putida mt-2 , a modified common soil bacterium which may have wide applications for destroying toxic substances .According_to the researchers , highly specific antibodies have ensured that the technique is a success .Engineering a time delayed & bquo ; lethal gene & equo ; into a GEM to give it a finite life ?could suddenly produce a GEM with some nasty trick up its sleeve .This GEM ?But losing GEMs could have much farther reaching implications .is one way .There are concerns that , once released , GEMs might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria .Link: [Comments: zero anaphor of GEMS]The researchers have devised a suite of methods based on detecting a marker gene engineered into the GEM .LOSING your favourite gems may be a personal disaster .The gene is very uncommon in nature so any intense yellow colonies of bacteria isolated from the wild ?Their method has been designed for recovering a GEM from water ?This research , to enable identification of a released GEM ?As a result , it '_ s been estimated that not many more than one per_cent can be cultured at any one time .by making a GEM both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ?Using catechol is relatively simple and cheap .GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital .
