"I don't have any answer for them," he says.Navy Officer Balances Religious Responsibilities Miami Herald January 31, 2002 Navy Officer Balances Religious Responsibilities By Carol Rosenberg GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba -- You're the first-ever American Muslim cleric to minister to a prison camp full of suspected terrorists and one confides he has a weapon.So far no one has asked him how a practicing Muslim can also wear the uniform of the U.S. armed forces.Until he emerged as the chaplain of choice for this special assignment from among only 14 Muslim clerics in the U.S. armed forces, he was the only cleric specifically assigned to a Marine Corps base -- at Camp Pendleton, Calif.Saiful-Islam is by training an imam, or a prayer leader, who guides the faithful in a mosque during the five-times-a-day Muslim prayer.Captives at Camp X-ray are entitled to spiritual solace, he says, even though he doesn't accept radical interpretations that have led them to an unorthodox battlefield against the so-called Great Satan, the United States.At Camp X-ray, he is also serving the function of a muezzin, the person who announces the call to prayer, commonly from a tower called a minaret.Military recruiters building a Muslim chaplains corps spotted Saiful-Islam in 1993, while he was an enlisted man working as a payroll clerk in the Pentagon and studying part-time to become a Muslim cleric."If they don't trust me with their needs, they don't get it," he says, with a sigh."These things are hard to find in America, and Gitmo is far, far away," says Saiful-Islam, a husband and father of a nearly 2-year-old daughter in California.As a U.S. military chaplain, his contacts with prisoners are governed by the same confidentiality as that of a priest, minister or rabbi in the clergy corps."I will say, 'Give it to me,' -- and not tell the general who had it," he says softly but firmly.
