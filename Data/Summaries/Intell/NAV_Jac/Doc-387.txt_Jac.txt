While calm has returned to Fleet Hospital 20, officials elsewhere on the base are bracing for what they say may be inevitable: the death of one of the detainees.One of the guards puts a hand behind the head of the detainee, forcing him to look down.While she sees the detainees as patients, she allows that they're not "regular patients."This is done to "provide positive control," says U.S. Army Col. Terry Carrico, in effect the prison warden.Base officials say there are Christian prisoners as well as Muslims."The role of chaplain is unique," Saiful-Islam says.After prayer, the detainees' day goes like this: breakfast, a shower (every other day), sick call, noon prayer, lunch, recreation (15 minutes a couple of times a week), mail call, sunset prayer, dinner, evening prayer and bedtime around 9 p.m.The hospital is several miles from Camp X-Ray, off Recreation Road.Each meal the detainees get is considered halal, or religiously appropriate for Muslims.11. When the detainees arrive at Camp X-Ray, they are told they're in Cuba and then undergo a 45-minute intake process, which, like the airstrip landing, is monitored by the Red Cross."If you do your job right," says Campion, 32, of Kansas City, Mo., "nothing is scheduled to happen.""They didn't know if we were going to take care of them, hurt them or kill them.""Watching wildlife can be a lot of fun," says the sign.Gen. Michael R. Lehnert, the commander of the prison project, says, "We continue to work to improve living conditions for both the detainees and our security forces."The doctors explain this is a common reaction as patients awake from anesthesia.Some guards don't want to talk about their views of the prisoners.Fleet Hospital 20 has nine patients today.This is for prisoners needing medical attention, as a fair number do.Just the other day, however, a surgeon took out the eye of a patient who had suffered a sports injury when he was younger."We don't hate the sinner," he says, "but we hate the sin."Jerome says the hospital feels no different than a hospital in the states, save for the high security and the various languages the detainees speak, including French, Russian, Urdu and Arabic."In the beginning, they were very unsure," says Carrico.Along the way, if allowed, the detainees would get to see a bit of Americana, a portrait built over the past century.It is day two at X-Ray for the 34 newly arrived from Kandahar.Except for an occasional spitting incident or threat, officials say, the prisoners are docile.They wear black baseball leg guards and bulletproof vests and carry M-16 rifles.Concertina wire and nine guard towers surround Camp X-Ray.After a 25-hour flight of mostly sitting, the prisoners hobble along as the Marines, who look twice as big, walk them out and frisk them.Abuhena Mohammad Saiful-Islam, 39, speaks more with the detainees than almost anybody at the camp.Not at the hands of the guards.The prisoners are here because the military considers them "hard-core" terrorists - willing to escape, to kill themselves and others.But with 300 already in custody, and scores in poor health to begin with, they say something is bound to happen.Unlike other parts of the base, the camp does not have a pretty setting."We don't go with a preconceived idea that the person is so and so.The 20-bed hospital is a high-tech, air-conditioned white tent which looks like a futuristic movie set, with low ceilings, fluorescent lighting, and padded white walls, floors and ceilings."They haven't said that God has abandoned them, because they know," he says.The staff gives reporters a quick tour of the hospital, allowing photographs of some sections but not of the patients."That's the hope that they have, that God is their only hope."You're doing good.""The security here I would consider tighter than death row in a prison in the United States."Within a couple months, he says, the operation will move to another part of Guantanamo called Radio Range, where utilities are more readily available and cells will have cots, air conditioning and toilets.They board buses that will take them to a ferry that will take them across Guantanamo Bay to a detention facility known as Camp X-Ray.The detainees also get fingerprinted and photographed.The American flag is everywhere - painted on the guard towers, flying high in front of the facility.Walk!" the guards shout.On a hot and windy afternoon, the deep blue waters of the Caribbean serve as the postcard backdrop.Last Wednesday, the 10th flight from Kandahar to the southeastern tip of Cuba arrived, bringing the total number of detainees at Camp X-Ray to 288.
