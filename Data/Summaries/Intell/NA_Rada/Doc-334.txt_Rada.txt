Sound management of the economy is an essential element in the conduct of the war against Palestinian violence and terrorism.But successful management of the economy - the second front - is essential so that the resources needed for defense needs can be made available without causing serious damage to the economy.With good economic management, Israel should have little trouble overcoming the present crisis.Most of the Argentine government's debt is in dollars, while most of the Israeli government's debt is, fortunately, in shekels.But all the talk of big cuts in the budgets of most of the ministries came to naught.Finally, the ministry realized the budget it had prepared would have to be drastically revised and curtailed.Then the finance minister dramatically announced an emergency economic plan based on large-scale tax increases in an already over-taxed economy.The structure of the Israeli economy is basically sound, but on the other hand, Israel is at war, with a significant proportion of its resources devoted to defense.
