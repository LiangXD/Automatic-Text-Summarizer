"President Bush today has decided that the Geneva Convention will apply to the Taliban detainees but not to the Al Qaeda international terrorists," Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters.Earlier on Wednesday, the US military resumed controversial flights of heavily guarded Al Qaeda and Taliban captives from Afghanistan to a naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a senior US official said.The official, who asked not to be identified, told newsmen that the first flight of captives in more than two weeks had left Afghanistan late on Wednesday and was to arrive at the isolated prison camp late on Thursday.The official did not say how many prisoners were on the flight.A total of 158 captives, whom the Pentagon has refused to classify as prisoners of war, are already being held and interrogated at Guantanamo amid criticism they have not been treated properly under the Geneva Convention.The move comes after fevered criticism - including from key US allies - stemming from alleged mistreatment of Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees the United States is holding at "Camp X-Ray" in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
