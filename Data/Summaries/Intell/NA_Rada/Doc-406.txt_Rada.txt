China criticizes US human rights report BEIJING - China issued its annual report on human rights in the United States on Monday, accusing Washington of turning a blind eye to abuses in its own land while criticizing other countries for theirs."Once again the United States, assuming the role of 'world judge of human rights' has distorted human rights conditions in many countries and regions in the world, including China, and accused them of human rights violations, all the while turning a blind eye to its own human rights-related problems," the Chinese report said.
