Space station astronaut Carl Walz sent another computer command from inside to get the railcar moving again.Ground controllers took over manual control and, a few hours later, were able to latch the railcar to the track.The railcar is needed to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm from one end of the outpost to the other as more girders are installed.Space station's railcar slightly off track CAPE CANAVERAL - (AP) -- Astronauts sent the international space station's new railcar rolling slowly down a short stretch of track Monday, but it quickly hit a snag that interrupted the inaugural run of the first permanent railroad in orbit.The railcar smoothly rolled 26 feet to a second work station, where the same thing happened.There is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track because of rings on both ends of the 44-foot girder, Sellari said.
