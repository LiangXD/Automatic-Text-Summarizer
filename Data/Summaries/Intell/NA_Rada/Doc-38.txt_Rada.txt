Over the same distance , people use two and a half times more energy ( per kilogram of their bulk ) than the average camel .Underpinning all these accomplishments is the camel '_ s efficient use of metabolic fuel ?Zoologists have yet to establish the precise mechanisms behind the camel '_ s fuel economy .One candidate is the leg musculature , which may turn out to be constructed from slower , more efficient fibres than those employed elsewhere .Analysis of the gas in the balloon told the team how much oxygen the camels were using as they walked .K. Yousef of the University of Nevada gathered recently in Australia to investigate the camel '_ s fuel economy .Stephen Young on the animals that excel in fuel economy Camels do it better .Once the zoologists had taken account of the difference in weight , the camels emerged as clear winners .the camel '_ s equivalent of mpg .Camels operate each foreleg and its associated hindleg in unison , more_like a pantomime horse than a regular quadruped .As the Christmas story demonstrates , more peace-loving potentates also appreciate the camel '_ s skills .The camel '_ s metabolic response to heavy loads is no less dramatic .Most animals increase their fuel consumption in proportion to the extra baggage they are carrying , but not the camel .The findings throw fresh light on the camel '_ s former popularity both as pack animal and military mount .a camel burns only around 15 per_cent more fuel than it burns unladen .a skill put to good use by Mohammed '_ s camel , which allegedly covered the distance between Mecca and Jerusalem in four bounds .
