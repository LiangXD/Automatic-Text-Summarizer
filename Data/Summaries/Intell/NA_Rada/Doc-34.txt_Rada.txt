There are so many bacteria everywhere that picking out a GEM is a_bit like looking for a candle amongst Blackpool '_ s illumination .Suspended in water , only the GEM for which the antibodies were specific will attach to the beads .Engineering a time delayed & bquo ; lethal gene & equo ; into a GEM to give it a finite life ?This GEM ?Once you have the GEMs on the polystyrene spheres they can be washed off and cultured for testing with catechol or other techniques .are almost certainly the lost GEMs .To develop a recovery method , Morgan , Saunders and Pickup used a Gem called Pseudomonas putida mt-2 , a modified common soil bacterium which may have wide applications for destroying toxic substances .Their method has been designed for recovering a GEM from water ?There are concerns that , once released , GEMs might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria .could suddenly produce a GEM with some nasty trick up its sleeve .A second problem is that many bacteria living & bquo ; in the wild & equo ; are not always easy to culture in the laboratory .This research , to enable identification of a released GEM ?So mt-2 '_ s purified pili and flagellae were injected into animals so that they rapidly produced antibodies specific to them .The researchers have devised a suite of methods based on detecting a marker gene engineered into the GEM .It '_ s not the only way of checking for C230 .is essential because_of the risks involved in letting GEMs out_of the laboratory .by making a GEM both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ?Link: [Comments: zero anaphor of GEMS]But the snag is that first you have to be able to recover the GEMs to culture them to do the catechol yellowing test .The beads plus GEM are recovered with a magnet .But losing GEMs could have much farther reaching implications .They '_ ve used one that codes for an enzyme called catechol 2,3-dioxygenase ( C230 for short ) .of very many different species ?The gene is very uncommon in nature so any intense yellow colonies of bacteria isolated from the wild ?Alun Morgan and Dr Jon Saunders of the department of genetics and microbiology at the University of Liverpool , working with Dr Roger Pickup of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology , Windermere , form one of a number of groups of scientists developing techniques to spot a GEM .The reluctance of UK Authorities to sanction their release ?GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital .As a result , it '_ s been estimated that not many more than one per_cent can be cultured at any one time .
