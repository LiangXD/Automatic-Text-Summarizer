In simpler terms, the interests of the United States are always above everything else, not only above the sovereignty of other nations, but also above the so-called values of "democracy" and "human rights" that the US always likes to dwell on.It will not be a "coup" so long as the United States thinks it is not!Both the White House and the US State Department expressed "satisfaction" over the stepping-down of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's constitutional president, and no one "wept over him."Why has the United States been picking on Chavez and Bustani all this time?After Chavez took office as Venezuelan president, he has pursued an independent foreign policy, and has been out of step with the United States in many areas.
