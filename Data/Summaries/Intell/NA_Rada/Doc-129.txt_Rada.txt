In the field of satellite communications, Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) spent $310 million to develop the ETS-8 (Engineering Test Satellite 8) satellite.They include a spy satellite, a data relay satellite to transfer data between satellites, an unmanned universe lab system, a test satellite for communications and broadcasting, an observation satellite for environmental protection, "Kibo" the Japanese experimental module of the space station and its supply system, and the H2A carrier rocket to launch all the spacecraft mentioned earlier.Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development.In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies.However, these two rockets are primarily used to launch low orbit satellites.This low cost approach brought about a series of satellite launch failures.Japan is determined to become a major power in aerospace.Japan also has a huge space power plant plan."Lunar A," one of the major projects, is aimed at delivering two penetrators on the moon to collect various data.In order to compete with the United States, Europe, and China, Japan decided to drastically reduce its costs, especially in every aspect of rocket design and manufacture.In addition, it also plans to develop 12 satellites, a new generation of unmanned space lab, a space station supply system, and a space shuttle in the next 5 years.Japan has prepared a military space program and allocated $1.3 billion to implement it.
