In his report, "Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development", released by the WHO last December, Sachs estimated that total annual health outlays in world's least- developed countries would rise by 17 billion U.S. dollars by 2007 and 29 billion U.S. dollars by 2015 and AIDS prevention and care would account for half the increase.Shanghai, May 9 (XINHUA)-- The spreading AIDS epidemic is threatening Asia's economic growth, warned officials from the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization and bank delegates at "Investing in Asia's Health", an Asian Development Bank (ADB) seminar held here Thursday.The WHO's recommendations for each developing country include increasing investment in health and relevant areas like education, water and agricultural development; the establishing of a temporary National Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (NCMH), chaired jointly by the Ministers of Health and Finance to organize and lead the medical as well as economic war against AIDS and other diseases."AIDS is casting shadow on Asia's economic miracle, and is turning into a global crisis, as the region accounts for 60 percent of world's population," says Michel Sidibe, Director of the Country and Regional Support Department of UNAIDS."With an alarming infection growth rate in many Asian Pacific countries, care for AIDS is over-burdening the health care system and is taking away from provision of other health services," said Sidibe.
