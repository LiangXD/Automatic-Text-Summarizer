According to Shakir, money laundering in the Arab world is "very minimal" but he said that Lebanon and Egypt are classified by international agencies as among the countries that have not taken necessary measures to combat this problem."Our institutions are far away from this money laundering phenomenon and Arab governments have amended banking laws to combat money laundering," Shakir said.Participants will also explore the role of banking and financial institutions in combating money laundering and the American and European approaches to fighting this problem.Money launderers target countries with low risk of detection, soft tax systems and lenient banking regulations, Shakir said.During the workshop, organised by the Union of Arab Banks (UAB), participants will also review legislation Arab countries have introduced to combat this phenomenon as well as the ways and means by which money is laundered.AMMAN -- A three-day workshop on money laundering started on Monday, with the participation of officials from several Arab banks, discussing the impact and size of this problem in the Middle East.
