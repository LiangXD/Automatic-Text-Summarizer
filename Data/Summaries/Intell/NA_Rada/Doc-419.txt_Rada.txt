The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down.So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, "Have you considered being a teacher assistant?"I think that was the last class I took.Yeah, and at the time, I was also working in the classroom.And I enjoy what I do.He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too.I don't, just so I can work in the school I'll be happy.I really don't, I don't remember why that school was ever closed but it was.I guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence.But he told me to go ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.I enjoy my job very much.I've only worked at two, two schools.If I could just work, even as a teacher assistant I would be happy."And before you know it, the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl's head off.So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.Well I didn't like writing at the time but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper.My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school.But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money."At first I didn't want to apply for it, but the principal called me during the summer months and said, "Sandra the time is running out, you need to apply."All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school.As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.
