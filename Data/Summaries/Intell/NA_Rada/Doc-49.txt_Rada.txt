On Monday , Formosa appealed to Taipei not to adopt policies that would jeopardise Taiwan's economic growth , hinting but not saying that bigger China investments were essential .In June 1996 , Formosa said it and local Fujian authorities would jointly build a 3,600-megawatt plant , easily the biggest Taiwan investment in China and the first in the power sector , which Taipei had made off limits for Taiwan investors .Formosa chairman Wang had said on Saturday that his group , Taiwan's top industrial enterprise , had begun construction of a US$3 billion power station in Fujian province in defiance of Taiwan's policy and would not take "_ no _" for an answer ."_ If the government ultimately decides not to allow the investment , Formosa group will respect the government's policy and abandon this investment project and turn it over to overseas business groups , _" Formosa said in a statement .TAIWAN : Formosa says would drop China deal if disapproved .The announcements from Formosa and the economic ministry capped a day of uncertainty and intense anxiety over the fate of the giant investment , with Taiwan stocks tumbling 1.42 percent $-- largely on the strength of a plastics sector selloff .Taiwan forbids direct China investments , obliging firms to route even small investments through Hong Kong or other third places after obtaining permits from the economic ministry ."_ We can clearly declare that the government will not allow investment in power plants ( in the Chinese mainland ) , _" Wang Chin-kang said on state radio .
