Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, easily beaten by the veteran president according to official results, said Mugabe had stolen the vote through violence and intimidation and by preventing hundreds of thousands of people from voting.Several hundred Mugabe supporters danced in celebration and carried mock coffins for Tsvangirai in two Harare townships.Mugabe won polls unfairly says West President Rob-ert Mugabe swept back to power in Zimbabwe yesterday after an election fiercely condemned by local monitors, the opposition and the West but praised by African nations.The opposition leader said his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) would not accept the result."The election results ... do not reflect the true will of the people of Zimbabwe and are consequently illegitimate," he said.A deep split appeared between Western nations and African countries monitoring the vote, who closed ranks behind Mugabe, calling the election legitimate.South Africa and Nigeria together with Australia comprise a special Commonwealth group given the power to take measures against Zimbabwe if the election is deemed not to have been free and fair.
