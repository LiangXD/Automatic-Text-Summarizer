The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent say, an early bacterium is somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world.In short, once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere.On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like F = MA and Darwin' s "natural selection" and "fitness," that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world.After all, I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment, defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf, then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf.A simple autonomous agent, say, a bacterium, is a Darwinian creature.Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the "doings" of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent.If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom "intentionality" and "purpose" are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties.Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier, yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics, intentionality, value, and ethics arise with autonomous agents.Popperian creatures, in Dennett' s fine phrase, have "internal models" of their world and can "run the internal model" with the clutch disengaged, rather than running the model in real time in the real world.Now, five chapters later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter, energy, and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf.If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a useful or more, a proper definition of life itself, then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where "purpose" is ascribed by all of us to one another.I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words.Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our tools literally stone knives, arrows, digging sticks, machine tools to enlarge our shared world of facts and processes.And the stunning fact directly before us, every day, is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf.The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents?Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent.Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creature namely, at least humans.From the fact that mothers care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, Hume argued.I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had, individually and collectively, the embodied know-how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world.There is no autonomous agent, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations.But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics.An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is (i) food; (ii) poison; (iii) a signal; (iv) neutral; (v) something else.While fully aware of Hume' s injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent' s perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent.It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling, chemical and otherwise, within and between autonomous agents, as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that "warns" other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites.What in the world is "know-how" ?Unlike "know that," "know-how" does not involve propositions about the world.Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological.Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn, long-legged, knowing how winter is thin, when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found.Without invoking consciousness, not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject, it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems, even without evoking nerve cells.But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings, Dan' s happy phrasing, is relevant for E. coli, tigers, us, trees, and autonomous agents in general.We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent, able to manipulate the universe on its own behalf the egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady, powerful flight.We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents.Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli, or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around.And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present?I will content myself with wondering where "value" and the rudiments of "intentionality" come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts.Philosophers distinguish between "know-how" and "know that."The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents.Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view.There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries, to doubt a physics of semantics.Stones and chairs are not, by my definition, autonomous agents.
