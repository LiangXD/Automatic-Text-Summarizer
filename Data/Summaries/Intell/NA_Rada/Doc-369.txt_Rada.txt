In the last few weeks, working with the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, Mr. Marx had been trying to persuade Argentina's foreign creditors to accept lower interest rates on existing debts.Mr. Marx stepped down as Argentina paid $700 million in short-term debt owed to local banks by forcing pension funds to buy government bonds.Finance Minister of Argentina Resigns Post The uncertainty of Argentina's precarious financial situation deepened yesterday when Daniel Marx, the finance secretary, resigned.Mr. Marx became finance secretary in December 1999 after a career in private finance and a stint on the board of Argentina's central bank.In discussing his decision, Mr. Marx suggested that it was time for someone else to oversee the government's negotiations with its creditors.Mr. Marx kept his job through the resignation and replacement of two economy ministers, Jose Luis Machinea and Ricardo Lopez-Murphy, and the return of Mr. Cavallo to government.The appointment of Mr. Kiguel to succeed Mr. Marx may be seen as a way to bring the Justicialists into Mr. De La Rua's ruling coalition, forming a sort of national unity government to address the economy."I agreed to continue to work on the national debt issues for Argentina," he said.Mr. Marx's resignation also followed a national strike on Thursday by union members, shopkeepers and unemployed workers, which brought the country close to a standstill.
