Before the United States attacked Afghanistan, it first explained the reasons to every nation of the world, and China using missiles to attack Taiwan is certainly not simple.Question: How should Taiwan respond to China's missile threat?Question: What is the significance for Taiwan of the United States and Japan jointly researching TMD theater missile defense system technology?Sato: I gave a speech on this issue in Taiwan.Taiwan has some people who very obviously purposely play up China's use of force to scare Taiwan.Kawamura: One of the reasons that the United States has all along not provided Aegis destroyers to Taiwan is that in the past the United States considered Taiwan's armed forces to be the armed forces of the Nationalist Party, not the armed forces of the nation.If Taiwan becomes a part of China, all of Taiwan's sea areas will be threatened.I reckon that the probability of war occurring between China and Taiwan is smaller than small.Kawamura: Japan and Taiwan are both exporting nations.Taiwan should make an all out effort to augment naval combat strength.Taiwan is also very important to the United States, especially Taiwan's strategic position.Taiwan announcing independence is not itself a problem, but because Taiwan announcing independence would bring unrest and a domino effect would occur with regard to Tibet and Xinjiang, this is China's greatest fear.Under these circumstances, Taiwan and Japan both must recognize clearly the important role of the navy.
