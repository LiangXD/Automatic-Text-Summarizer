A short time later, the Community Youth Mapping Project sent 55 young people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow up well: caring adults, safe places to go, and positive things to do.Annually, we ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis.As a provider of youth services, MCCOY, Inc. is here to support your valuable efforts to develop young people.
