For the next 19 years, Jerusalem was two cities.In 1947 the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with Jerusalem as an international city that belonged to neither.Jews were evacuated from the Old City' s Jewish Quarter, and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem.However, with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire, no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem.West Jerusalem, separated from the rest of the new Jewish nation, held out under siege for several months until Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the coastal areas.Christian and Islamic Jerusalem For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins, until the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to Jupiter.The Bible describes how David' s soldiers conquered Jerusalem by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the city by surprise.When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism, Jews led by Judah Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b.c. and, against all odds, restored the primacy of Jewish religious life in Jerusalem.The planned new Roman city, Aelia Capitolina, was built over the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem, and Jews were barred from residing there for all time.Today, as always, Jerusalem is a city of controversies: religious Jews in conflict with secular Jews; Palestinians calling for independence; many residents protesting a wave of high-rise development that many claim will turn the Holy City into a holy megalopolis.Roman Jerusalem After the initial years of Roman administration and political infighting, Rome installed Herod (scion of a family from Idumea, a Jewish kingdom in the desert) as King of Judea.She found that the city' s most beautiful Roman temple, dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite, stood on the site of the crucifixion.As a result of armistice agreements in 1949, Jerusalem was divided: West Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control, and East Jerusalem (including the Old City, with its Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters) came under Jordanian authority.The Temple and royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with cedar from Lebanon; the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3,000 years.Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times.19th-Century Aspirations At the same time, many Jews sought religious freedom and fulfillment by moving to Palestine (as the Holy Land was traditionally called) and especially to Jerusalem.Biblical Jerusalem In the Bible, Genesis 14:18 -- 20 records that Abraham visited the city of "Salem" in approximately 1800 b.c. and was blessed by the city' s ruler, Melchzedik, who offered him bread and wine.The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed.But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth century, and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again.The Second Temple was finished in 515 b.c. , but much of the city still lay in ruins.At the beginning of the second millennium b.c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route, far less important than biblical cities such as Hazor, Megiddo, Beth Shean, and Shechem.Pilgrims came from all over the Roman (and, later, Byzantine) Empire during the following centuries, but the prosperity they brought lasted only until 614, when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced Jerusalem to rubble again.Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple, making it one of the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire.
