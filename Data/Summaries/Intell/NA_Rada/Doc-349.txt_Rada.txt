But the agency's credibility has come under fire in manned spaceflight - especially the International Space Station, now completing its first year of full-time crews.Now O'Keefe's is to fix the space station."And this month, a task force on the project's budget concluded that NASA's cost estimate for finishing the "core" station between 2002 and 2008 "is not credible."The next mission for NASA could be to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program.O'Keefe's appointment "is a clear message from the administration: NASA has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we'd like to see NASA do," says Patricia Dasch of the National Space Society."O'Keefe is not known as a space enthusiast," says Keith Cowing, a former NASA scientist and editor of NASAWatch.com.This weekend, the agency bade farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, who resigned after 10 years in office - an agency record.In assessing how the agency might fare under O'Keefe, some analysts say it could blossom, as it did in its Apollo-program heyday under another numbers guy, James Webb.With a mandate to cut costs, Goldin implemented a "faster, better, cheaper" approach.
