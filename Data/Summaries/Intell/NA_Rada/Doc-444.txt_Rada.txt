We've scheduled more than 15 follow-up camper weekends beginning in September and going around till next summers camping season.I hope you'll consider continuing your support of Jameson's special campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx.It seems summer options aren't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes, so we're doing all we can to make Jameson available.
