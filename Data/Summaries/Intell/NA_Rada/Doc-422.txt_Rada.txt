Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands, the next major power change brought influence from the West.The Ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled, forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean.In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval, the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans (at around 1300 b.c. ), who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland.After the war, in 1949, the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation.In 1770, Russia came to aid the Greeks (defined by their Orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries), declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774.Cycladic Culture At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the Cyclades islands.Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories.The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen, many of whom were Genoese or Venetian, such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos.Although the islands saw little action, as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power.The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism, and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp, cool summers.a brief History Prehistoric man in Asia Minor (now modern Turkey) or Greece could look out across the Aegean toward the horizon and see the faint silhouette of land.By the time of the Crusades, many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated.In 1566, they wrested Chios from the Genoese, bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands, but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or more -- Tinos was the last to fall in 1715.Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty and terror, and many made new homes in the United States and Australia.The Persian Wars As Athens rose in influence and power in the West, it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire.The Aegean Islands, which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes, became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse.An important early material, obsidian, was discovered on the island of Milos.His forces made a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands, including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town, but they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population against them.Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors, who were led by Philip II of Macedon.The preeminent islands of this era were Delos, a sacred island and center of religion ruled by Athens; Samos, ruled by the tyrant Polycrates; and Naxos, whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major building projects.Many had to leave their birthplaces, fleeing to Lesvos, Chios, and Samos, the Greek-ruled islands just offshore.330, however, when the newly converted Emperor Constantine made Byzantium, renamed Constantinople, capital of his Eastern Empire that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek life.While Byzantine land was being divided, there was no one in control of the seas, so pirates raided towns on many of the islands.Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the islands.In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen Muslims, a new potent religious force from the East, the Byzantine army forcefully enlisted the men of the islands.In 431 b.c. , Athens began a war with its neighbor and league member Sparta.
