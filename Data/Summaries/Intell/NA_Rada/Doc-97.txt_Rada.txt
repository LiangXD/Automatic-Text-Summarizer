David Lawder DETROIT 1997-03-31 Continuing at a steady but unspectacular pace , U.S. car and truck sales for March are expected to show gains for Japanese and German automakers at the expense of Detroit's Big Three , analysts said Monday .CS First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas said Chrysler's sluggish passenger car sales are "_ troublesome , _" given the company's increased dealer incentive spending in the first quarter .But GM's improved sales are not expected to be enough to offset the market share gains by Toyota Motor Corp. , Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and other Japanese automakers , particular in the intermediate passenger car market .Analysts said Japanese automakers are expected to continue increasing sales and market share , based on a hot portfolio of new products coupled with a weak Japanese yen that allows them to price more aggressively .Analysts estimate that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for March light vehicle sales will be about 15 million to 15.4 million units , compared with 15.5 million a year ago .Both Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are expected to report March sales declines of about 3 percent , compared with a year ago , while General Motors Corp. may post gains of 3 percent to 6 percent over last year's strike-affected results .Last week at the New York Auto Show , both Chrysler and Ford signaled that their sales may be down slightly .This year's market is very competitive , _" said Schroder Wertheim analyst John Casesa .The Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase in interest rates last week is not expected to have an immediate effect on vehicle sales , analysts said .As the year drags on , automakers will probably have to fork over increasingly higher incentives to maintain sales rates above 15 million , Casesa said .
