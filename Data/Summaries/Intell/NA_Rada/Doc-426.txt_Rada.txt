Yesterday's Los Angeles Times ran a story under the headline "Paula Jones Works on Her Court Appearance," which, illustrated by pictures of Jones, was all about the various looks she's had since stepping on the public stage.In the Texas case, reports USAT , the defendant companies have agreed to pay about $15 billion over 25 years to reimburse the state for expenses it incurred in the treatment of smoking-related illnesses.The NYT abortion survey, the first conducted by the paper since 1989, was based on telephone interviews of 1,101 people and detects "a notable shift from general acceptance" of having the procedure: from 40 percent to 32 percent.The Wall Street Journal states that the plaintiffs' lawyers hired by Texas to try the case will receive as part of the deal almost $2.2 billion in fees.Some local cable companies, the paper says, expect the fees they'll pay ESPN to go up more than 20 percent.And the pollsters also detected an increasingly acute sensitivity to abortion timing: Sixty-one percent of those polled thought abortions should be permitted during the first trimester, but only 15 percent in the second and just 7 percent in the third.The placement of these two pieces is a PR triumph, but one carrying the seeds of its own destruction: If people know all this work is going into making Paula Jones seem a certain someone, doesn't that just make it obvious that she's really somebody else?(The piece notes that this last stat helps explain why a focus on partial-birth abortions has proven politically advantageous for abortion foes.)
