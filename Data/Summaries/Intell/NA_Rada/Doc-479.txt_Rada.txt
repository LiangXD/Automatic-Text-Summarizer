The European Parliament, which convened yesterday in Strasbourg, decided to advise the 15 member states of the European Union to impose economic sanctions on Israel and, specifically, to suspend association agreements with Jerusalem.Countries like France and Belgium are easily capable of voting for sanctions against Israel, but other states -- including Germany and Britain -- have exhibited a more balanced position regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.For some time, European politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with Israel -- a move, which in light of close and extensive trade relations between EU member states and Israel, could cause serious damage.The Europeans know that repeated denunciations of Israel, not to mention its punishment, will not lead to a solution of the conflict.Israel will not change its positions on vital security issues, even if the European states eliminate customs breaks afforded to Israeli exports.
