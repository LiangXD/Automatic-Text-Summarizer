Zimbabwe's president is sworn in SubHead: Lawmakers boycott event Author: BY JON JETER HARARE, Zimbabwe - President Robert Mugabe was sworn in Sunday for his fifth term in office following a bitterly fought election that the opposition and many Western governments denounced as rigged.Investors and Western diplomats have said they might interpret Mbeki's support for Mugabe or the elections as a sign that Africa is not intent on revitalizing its economies through good government and expanded international trade.South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing Mugabe to accept such an arrangement to avoid deepening international sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies.Mugabe is a former rebel leader who led this country to independence from Britain 22 years ago."Thanks to the people of Zimbabwe for loudly saying: Never again shall Zimbabwe be a colony," Mugabe said.
