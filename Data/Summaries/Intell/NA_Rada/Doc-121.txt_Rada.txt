"Trade alone will not save the world," Neyts said, "but in as far as it refers to the free exchange of products and movement of persons, it constitutes an important factor for economic development."During this meeting, she has scheduled a meeting with peaceful antiglobalists, "but there is little I can do," she said in an interview."Therefore, it is a positive development that all 'summits' will be held in Brussels as of 2003," Neyts said."This is no blind violence but rather targeted violence," Annemie Neyts said referring to the antiglobalist movement that set Gothenburg and Genoa, among other cities, ablaze.Neyts understands that developing countries may feel uneasy about the kind of trade negotiations that are conducted at WTO level.The WTO is accused of fostering trade anarchy."There is not one developing country that wants to link social regulations to WTO regulations.Neyts rejects all forms of violence, but understands the protests."Actually, I do not know what else we can do.Neyts is a resolute defender of world trade and the World Trade Organization (WTO).The WTO texts include passages about the need to heed civilian society and to pay attention to durable development."First, his foreign trade minister, Annemie Neyts, has to create the right climate.Those countries do not possess the necessary expertise to conduct such highly technical negotiations."I think that the development debate does not focus enough on political development and political stability.Today, she will read a declaration on globalization in the European Parliament; later this week she will preside the informal meeting of EU foreign trade ministers in Bruges.International cooperation is slow and does not function optimally, but the alternatives are worse."
