Why didn't the United States inform Venezuela's constitutional government of the coup attempt by Rincon and the others?Hence one can see that it is not to be surprised that the United States chimed in with the Venezuela's coup organizers.According to US news media, that coup in Venezuela had something to do with the United States.Coup d'etat is an unusual means to seize a country's political power.Just as Venezuela restored its constitutional rule and Chavez was returned to power, the New York Times came up with a shocking story: the US Government and senior military officials were in contact with the Venezuelan coup organizers.States "supports democracy" and that "we in no way would support any coups or unconstitutional activity."This is far out of tune with the attitude the United States used to take when a coup occurred in other countries.
