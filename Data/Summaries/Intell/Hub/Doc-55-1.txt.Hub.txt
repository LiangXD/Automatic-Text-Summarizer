The donors' conference, co-sponsored by the European Commission and the World Bank, was hoping to raise 1.25 billion dollars (1.47 billion euros) for Yugoslavia this year for urgent repairs to infrastructure and salaries to teachers and other civil servants. By midday, the conference had garnered pledges totalling some 1.37 billion dollars in grants and low- or no-interest loans over the next three years, against the target figure set by the World Bank of 3.9 billion dollars for what Belgrade would need for the three-year period. The European Commission anounced it had pledged a financial package of grants and loans totalling 530 million euros (450 million dollars). Labus said the United States, which had until the last minute been uncertain of attending the conference, contingent on Milosevic's extradition, pledged 181.6 million dollars during the morning session. Japanese Ambassador to the EU Takayuki Kimura said his country had pledged 50 million dollars, in addition to technical assistance and another 10 million dollars to the whole of southeast Europe, most of it to Yugoslavia. Johannes Linn, World Bank vice-president for Europe and Central Asia, said the bank had pledged 150 million dollars for the current calendar year and over the next three years we expect to support Yugoslavia to the tune of about 540 million US dollars in concessional loans. Linn said that as a result of recent changes in Belgrade, including the Milosevic extradition, we will now be talking about Yugoslavia as an integral part of the successful formula of trust for economic recovery in the region. There is no quick fix to the Yugoslav problem, the World Bank's Johannes Linn said.
