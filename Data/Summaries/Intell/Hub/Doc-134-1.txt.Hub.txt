Moscow, 16 October: Afghan Northern Alliance units led by Gen Abdorrashid Dostum lack weapons and ammunition to properly fight the Taleban, Dostum said, noting that he has not received any Russian supplies to the Northern Alliance so far. The US air strikes have destroyed Taleban emplacements near Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum said. Moreover, Taleban fighters not stained with blood could be in this government, too, he said.
