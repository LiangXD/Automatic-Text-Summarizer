Confidence in the local currency is an essential element of a sound economy. There are many differences between the Israeli and Argentine economies. The structure of the Israeli economy is basically sound, but on the other hand, Israel is at war, with a significant proportion of its resources devoted to defense. Sound management of the economy is an essential element in the conduct of the war against Palestinian violence and terrorism. With good economic management, Israel should have little trouble overcoming the present crisis. While it was already clear that the economy was well on its way to a recession, the ministry's bureaucrats forecast continued growth for the economy. Finally, the ministry realized the budget it had prepared would have to be drastically revised and curtailed. Then the finance minister dramatically announced an emergency economic plan based on large-scale tax increases in an already over-taxed economy. At the same time, there was no let-up in his continuing battle with the governor of the Bank of Israel, who is supposed to be his partner in managing Israel's economy. It should be clear that the problem Israel is facing at this time has much more than just an economic dimension. Israel is at war. But successful management of the economy - the second front - is essential so that the resources needed for defense needs can be made available without causing serious damage to the economy. @ CopyRight 2002 Ha'aretz.
