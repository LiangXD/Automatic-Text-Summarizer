The first Lamizidivir tablets have been sold for VND 19,500 ($1.2) since May of this year, under the permit from the Vietnam Pharmaceutical Control Department. The department said that it will cost $600 for an HIV/AIDS patient per year at this time, and the following years this cost is expected to stand at just $400/year for one patient as the production of such drugs becomes stable. In the near future, the ministry added, more kinds of such drugs including Nevirappine, Afaviren and Abavir will be available.
