BEIJING: China on Thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the United States and Taiwan, demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to US weapons sales. China has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the United States and Taiwan, Zhang said. Military tensions in the Taiwan Strait were not in the self-interests of the United States, she warned. The visit, if Beijing allows it, is widely expected to be centered on China's dissatisfaction over the Taiwan issue. US officials denied Wolfowitz's remarks reflected a change in US policy on Taiwan. Zhang said: The remarks of the US official are a... violation of US commitments made (on Taiwan) and interference in China internal affairs. China is firmly opposed to the remarks.
