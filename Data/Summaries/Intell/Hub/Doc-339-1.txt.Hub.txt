'Axis of evil' charge raises questions WASHINGTON -- President Bush's declaration that countries such as Iran, Iraq and North Korea represent an "axis of evil" that must be prevented from acquiring weapons of mass destruction touched off questions around the globe Wednesday. But the president's remarks clearly expanded the scope of his anti-terrorism campaign while elevating the fight against the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons to a major foreign-policy priority, U.S. officials said. The president told Congress that Iran, Iraq and North Korea pose "a grave and growing danger" because they seek weapons of mass destruction and have links with terrorist groups. All three nations Bush named angrily rejected his remarks. President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, whose attempt at reforms have gotten American support, accused the United States of "warmongering." Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, responding to Bush's "axis of evil" remark, said the U.S. government "is the source of evil" in the world. American intelligence has known for a decade or more of attempts by Iran, Iraq and North Korea to develop nuclear weapons, poisons and germs. For Iran, Bush's condemnation marked a return to confrontation. As with Iran, the Bush administration has tried talk and threats with North Korea.
