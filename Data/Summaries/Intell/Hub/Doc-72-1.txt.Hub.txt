CROATIA : Serbs throw bricks at Croatian HDZ party delegates. Serbs throw bricks at Croatian HDZ party delegates. Laura Lui ZAGREB 1997-03-31 Hundreds of angry Serbs attacked delegates from Croatia's ruling HDZ party who had to be rescued by U.N. peacekeepers while trying to campaign for upcoming elections in Eastern Slavonia on Monday. Eastern Slavonia will revert to Croatian rule this summer. Croatia recaptured two other enclaves in 1995 and agreed to peacefully _ reintegrate _ Eastern Slavonia , now monitored by some 5,000 U.N. peacekeepers , whose mandate expires on July 15. Western officials are concerned that many Serbs , fearing reprisals or refusing to live under Croatian rule , may leave Eastern Slavonia before Zagreb's control is restored.
