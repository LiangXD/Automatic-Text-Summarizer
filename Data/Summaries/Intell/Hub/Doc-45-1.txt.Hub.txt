Partono said he expected Indocement's cement division to imrove its performance in 1997 and 1998 due_to additional capacity from two new plants in West Java and Kalimantan. Partono said Indofood's new West Java plant , with an annual capacity of 1.3 million tonnes , would start operations in April while the one in Kalimantan , with an annual capacity of 2.4 million tonnes , would start operations in August 1998. _ Growth of its cement division in 1996 was not too exciting as volume growth and price increases were relatively small. But in 1997 and 1998 , its cement division should pick up due_to additional capacity , _ Partono said. However , Partono said he expected Indocement to perform only in line with the broader market and not exceed it. _ If we break up the value of Indocement into two divisions , cement and food , the cement business is undervalued , _ he said. Partono said it was hard to make a fair valuation for Indocement because it could not be considered a pure cement stock or a pure food stock.
