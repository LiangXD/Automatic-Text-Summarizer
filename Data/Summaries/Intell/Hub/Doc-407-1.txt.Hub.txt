The agency has received three official applications for a commercial flight. A source in space circles told Interfax that the applications came from one Russian citizen, a woman from Australia and one more unnamed person. The Russian pop group Na-Na has not given up plans for a space flight either. However, the Russian Aerospace Agency told Interfax that it has not received any official applications from either the Americans or the Russian pop group.
