One of the areas we've decided to focus on is development. In 1998, CCI served 31,484 individuals right in their own backyards. Where else would that many people turn if CCI weren't there to help? This in turn will help us to increase and even improve the services we offer. I also encourage you to seek additional support through your company, church, or service organization.
