(A responsible account of the whole controversy in today's New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon had nothing to do with her corroboration.) The Journal editorial page gets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op-Ed by Dorothy Rabinowitz on Feb. 19. Because it has published three times since the initial omission, it scores an additional three points. Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus points for having eventually convinced Broaddrick to grant an interview to the New York Times (as the Times reports in today's story). When Chatterbox asked the Journal 's DC bureau chief, Alan Murray, who exercised good judgment in not breaking the Broaddrick story (and--full disclosure-- is Chatterbox's former boss), to comment about a Journal employee's feeding sources to the Times , he replied: I don't really have any comment on what the edit page did. Which is what Journal news employees are instructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing embarrassment. Ms. Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared at the house in the a.m., and that she had refused an interview, Rabinowitz writes in an e-mail message. I asked her why she had decided to talk to the New York Post 's Steve Dunleavy, and refused a Times reporter. She asked if I thought it would be all right to talk to the Times reporter. I passed this on to [ Times reporter] So--that's how it happens that in the New York Times piece today I'm described--solemnly--as having 'eventually convinced' her to repeat the story to the New York Times. --Timothy Noah
