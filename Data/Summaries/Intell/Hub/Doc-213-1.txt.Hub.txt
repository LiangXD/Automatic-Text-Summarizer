Govt dismisses US rights report GOVERNMENT yesterday trashed a US human rights report which lists a number of human rights violations in Namibia at the hands of security forces and Government. The US government report on Namibia's human rights practices for 2001, released this week, says members of the security forces committed several extra-judicial killings during security operations in the Kavango and Caprivi Regions during 2001. The Government did not account for the whereabouts of some persons detained by the security forces. During arrests and detentions, security force members reportedly tortured and beat citizens who were suspected of complicity with Unita, the report says. According to the rights report, most of the abuses were perpetrated by Special Field Force (SFF) members.
