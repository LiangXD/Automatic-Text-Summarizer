Mugabe victory leaves West in tatters HARARE: Western countries were left frustrated and impotent after Robert Mugabe formally declared that he had overwhelmingly won Zimbabwe's presidential election. The extent to which Mugabe outmanoeuvred the west was made clear when southern African countries issued a surprise statement declaring the conduct of the election free and fair. The Zimbabwe registrar-general, Tobaiwa Mudede, declared that Mugabe had won a fifth term in office after the results from all 120 constituencies were returned. We find ourselves unable to endorse the purported election of President Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in this election. It's the biggest election fraud I've witnessed in my life. We need Tsvangirai to tell Mugabe he cannot steal this election, said Noel Gukuta, a youthful MDC voter. The country took the news of Mugabe's victory with no great celebrations or protests. Apart from the result, the main jolt yesterday was that election observers from South Africa, Nigeria and Namibia effectively endorsed the election. It is our considered view that the election was free and fair and reflects the wishes of the people of Zimbabwe, Namibia's observer team said in a statement, adding that the poll was watertight, without room for rigging. The South African team described the election as legitimate while the Nigerian observers said they had seen nothing that threatened the integrity of the poll. In the final results, Mugabe made a net gain of votes compared with the 2000 parliamentary election in every province in the country.
