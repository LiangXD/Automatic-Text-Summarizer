For 10 days, the second Belgian astronaut will get to the International Space Station [ISS] on board the brand new Russian Soyuz TMA-1 space ship. On Thursday [29 November] the Belgian Government formally committed itself, vis-a-vis its Russian and European partners (the European Space Agency [ESA]), to pay Frank De Winne's ticket into space. The document, a letter sent to both the ESA (European Space Agency, to which Frank De Winne currently reports) and the Russian Rosaviacosmos space agency, guaranteed the payment by Belgium of the expenses tied to this space trip. So on 4 November 2002, that is to say, in a little less than one year, the second Belgian to reach space will take off from the Baikonor cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on board a brand new Soyuz space ship: the TMA-1. So he will be the second most qualified crew member on board, behind the on-board comander, who still needs to be appointed by the Russian space authorities. So, if that should prove necessary, De Winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship. The sum in question will come from the SSTC's space budgets and be deducted in several years (two or three). Nor will the space sector's in particular. In a word, De Winne's ticket into space has been financed. This should insure that we can recover the sums involved, that in the prospect of another space trip. In a few weeks the second Belgian to go up there will don a Russian cosmonaut's space suit. De Winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting. As Picque emphasized, for many years, each franc invested by Belgium in space has brought in three francs. Who said that space investments were not interesting?
