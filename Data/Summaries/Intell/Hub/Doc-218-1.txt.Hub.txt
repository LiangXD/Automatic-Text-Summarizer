Nevertheless, in his subsequent remarks, Bush encouraged Sharon to continue. The categorical moral condemnation of terrorism is self-evident, but this will not free Israel from the problem it faces. Israeli's own 35-year-old occupation and resettlement policies have created the breeding ground for the terrorism that Sharon is now trying to root out by resorting exclusively to military means. Israel is responsible for about three million bitter people who lack political rights. Israel's resettlement policies have been justified on the grounds of security. Traffic to the settlements prevents the effective monitoring of Israel's borders. Since Sharon refuses to offer the Palestinians their own state with acceptable borders and conditions, there are two alternatives left. One would think that no politically prudent Israeli could support either of them. Terrorism will not be absent from such a country and, in the process, Israel will lose the right to count itself among the world's democracies. Sharon, of course, will not admit that he is planning anything like this, even though the idea has been discussed in Israel.
