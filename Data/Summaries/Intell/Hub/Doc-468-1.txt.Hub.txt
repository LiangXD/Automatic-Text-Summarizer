The Zionist and US administrations have the illusion that they succeeded in defeating the Palestinian people and their valiant intifadah. All this is one thing, but the Palestinian people's will is something different. The Zionists have succeeded in achieving these things, but a deep-rooted fact is that they have not succeeded, and will never succeed, in breaking the will of this valiant people or in forcing the Palestinians into relinquishing their just, legitimate rights and ending their glorious struggle for these rights. The real victor in this battle is, in fact, the Palestinian people and not the Zionists. For many reasons, the occupation of Palestinian towns cannot last, so the Zionist forces will have to withdraw from these towns sooner or later. This is actually one of the deep-rooted facts. As for the towns and refugee camps that have been destroyed, they will soon be reconstructed by the Palestinian people who have skillfully adapted themselves to the most difficult circumstances. The conclusion to which we come is that the Zionist and US administrations have aggravated the Zionist entity's historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that force can break the Palestinian people's will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose.
