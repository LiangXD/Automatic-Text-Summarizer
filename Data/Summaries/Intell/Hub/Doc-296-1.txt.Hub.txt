Chinese space exploration: When will a Chinese cosmonaut fly into space? Shenzhou-3 orbited the Earth 108 times, and successfully landed on the targeted site in inner Mongolia: the Chinese space program is developing. There was even an Austrian there, but the country who organized the forum, the third country on the rating of space explorers, was not represented. China will not agree to put its citizens on a foreign spaceship, as it must launch its own space vehicle from its own cosmodrome. The Soviet Union can launch ambassador Liu Xiao into space! Two years ago, in October of 1955, Beijing received a person with the reputation of the Chinese Korolev Qian Xuesen, who came to China from the USA, where he had settled after graduating from Shanghai university, so it would be better to call him Chinese von Broun. At the same time, when the Chinese von Broun managed to reach China, there were other bearers of fresher secrets there from the country, which could launch ambassador Liu Xiao into space. China's three (unmanned) spaceships were launched into space from there: Shenzhou-1 was launched on November 20, 1999; it stayed in the orbit for about 24 hours, having orbited the Earth 14 times. Shenzhou-3 (blasted off on March 25) stayed in space for the same period of time, with the same number of circuits around the Earth. However, it is evident now that China has reliable rocket systems; it has mastered the art of space navigation and soft landing of a spaceship. China knows how to build its own spaceships, and there are people who can become cosmonauts. As China's experts believe, there should be at least four test unmanned flights performed before they can launch a man into space. Therefore, the Chinese Gagarin will probably say Go! no later than 2005. China is also working on programs for Chinese cosmonauts to fly to the Moon, as well as a space station.
