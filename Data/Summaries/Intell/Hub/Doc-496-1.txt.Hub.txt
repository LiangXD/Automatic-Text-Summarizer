US Ambassador to Indonesia Ralph L. Boyce praised the Indonesian government on Monday [18 Mar] for its efforts to protect foreign investors in the country, including Americans, but warned that investors were still concerned about the security of their investments. We take seriously the government's responsibility to protect Americans -- not only Americans but also other foreigners in Indonesia. But the government was quick to give assurances about the safety of foreign workers in Indonesia. The AmCham delegation is in Indonesia for a two-day visit to assess business opportunities in this country. The Singapore-based members of this mission want to hear from senior members of the Indonesian government about efforts to expand foreign business participation in the economy.
