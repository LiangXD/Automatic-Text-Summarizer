Buenos Aires, 22 April (Telam) -- Justicialist Deputy Jose Manuel Diaz Bancalari said today that the IMF is seeking to create an uncontrollable social situation with the demands it has made of the government and, on the other hand, he confirmed the PJ [Justicialist Party] bloc's willingness to support approval of the draft law on bonds submitted by the executive branch. It seems as if they are seeking to create an uncontrollable social situation, the legislator stated this morning, referring to the demands presented by the IMF to the country for reaching a new agreement that would bring in foreign financing for the government's accounts. Analyzing the IMF's responsibility in the complex crisis the country is experiencing, Diaz Bancalari stated his impression that the IMF members want more money for themselves, without admitting any degree of co-responsibility their managers have had in the things that have happened in Argentina. I think there must be reasonable things in the agreement the country reaches with the IMF, Diaz Bancalari said, and then he asserted that Argentina is a country in which one can do good business, but what they must know is that there is no more room for shady deals.
