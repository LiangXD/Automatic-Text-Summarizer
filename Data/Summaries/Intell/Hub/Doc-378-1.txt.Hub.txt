Harsh detention for Afghan prisoners Taleban and al-Qaeda prisoners flown from Afghanistan to an American naval base in the Caribbean are being held in tough conditions of detention. A temporary detention centre called Camp X-Ray has been set up at the base in Guantanamo Bay, an isolated US outpost on the edge of Fidel Castro's Cuba. The prisoners are being housed in cells measuring 1.8 by 2.4 metres (six feet by eight feet) with open, chain-link walls, a concrete floor and wooden roof. Washington wants military tribunals to try the prisoners, and the cases are expected to be heard outside the US. As the base is located outside sovereign territory, the prisoners have no legal rights under the US constitution, and no right of appeal to federal courts. The cells had concrete floors, wooden roofs and wire mesh walls. They say they will be holding the detainees in cells, but really they are cages... The first group to arrive - 20 prisoners described by US military officials as the worst elements of al-Qaeda and the Taleban - wore goggles covered with tape and had their hands tied. They wore surgical masks as some prisoners had tested positive for tuberculosis and at least one prisoner was sedated. Hundreds of marines and military police have been flown to Guantanamo Bay to expand the compound to house up to 2,000 prisoners. American marines landed in Guantanamo during the Spanish-American war in 1898, and the base was established under a 1903 treaty. Hunt continues American officials have named al-Qaeda and Taleban leaders killed or captured as frustration grows that some senior Taleban figures are reportedly slipping through the net. Among those who have not been questioned by the US military are three former Taleban ministers who turned themselves into the new Afghan authorities - only to be allowed to return to their homes.
