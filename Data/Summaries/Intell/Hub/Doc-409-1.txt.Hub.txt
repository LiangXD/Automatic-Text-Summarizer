He resorted to public assistance dollars to survive. Finally, Michael called Goodwill. At last, he has found success in a job that he loves. Every year, thousands of people come to Goodwill. With support from people like you, they can overcome their barriers and earn success and the self-sufficiency that comes with it. Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public support and more paying taxes. Last year, participants in Goodwill programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $3.5 million. Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three-quarters of a million dollars in public assistance. Won't you help make all of these successes possible? For every dollar of public support Goodwill received last year, we returned $1.59 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments.
