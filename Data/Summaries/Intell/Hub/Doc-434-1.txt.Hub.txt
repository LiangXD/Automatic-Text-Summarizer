Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full of hope and with a positive outlook. Thanks to our Big Sisters volunteers, these young people are self-confident, believe in themselves and are beginning to realize their full potential. A recent study bypositive Public/Private Ventures (PPV) showed that girls who had a Big Sister for just one year: reduced first-time drug use by 46% lowered school absenteeism by 52% cut violent behavior by 33% enhanced school performance showed improved peer and family relationships Former Little Sister Amy, now 18-years old, is a testament to the Big Sisters program. I was matched with my Big Sister in June of 1992. Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister, but I learned a lot from her too. I am very thankful to the Big Sisters program for allowing me this very special opportunity. In 1998, Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many programs. Over 170 young people are still waiting for a mentor. Will you make a financial gift to Big Sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the guidance they need, that more young people stay in school, stay off drugs and make good choices? If you would like to find out more about the Big Sisters program, please call us, (317) 634-6102 and ask for Ellen Robinson. Sincerely, Andrew T. Burns Patron Relations Chairperson P.S.
