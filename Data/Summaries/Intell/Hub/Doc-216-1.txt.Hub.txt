LONDON, March 7 (AFP) -- The mother of a Briton detained at a US naval base in Cuba set up for alleged Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters has launched High Court proceedings aimed at forcing Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to arrange legal access for her 22-year-old son. Lawyers for Zumrati Juma, mother of Feroz Abassi, on Wednesday [6 March] added that they would press the British government to take action to shut down the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where 300 prisoners, including five Britons, are being held.
