TAIPEI 1997-03-31 Taiwan conglomerate Formosa Plastics group said on Monday it had promised to drop a China power plant investment if Taipei , as expected , denies a permit allowing it to finance the controversial project. _ If the government ultimately decides not to allow the investment , Formosa group will respect the government's policy and abandon this investment project and turn it over to overseas business groups , _ Formosa said in a statement. Taiwan economic minister Wang Chih-kang confirmed receiving such assurances from Formosa chairman Wang Yung-ching and said Taiwan had no intention of allow Formosa to finance the plant. _ We can clearly declare that the government will not allow investment in power plants ( in the Chinese mainland ) , _ Wang Chin-kang said on state radio. In June 1996 , Formosa said it and local Fujian authorities would jointly build a 3,600-megawatt plant , easily the biggest Taiwan investment in China and the first in the power sector , which Taipei had made off limits for Taiwan investors.
