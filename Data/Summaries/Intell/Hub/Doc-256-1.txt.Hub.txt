Poughkeepsie also expects to post a one-time charge of $8.3 million, resulting in a net loss for the third quarter. The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie's investment in the banks it is trying to sell and its North Carolina branches as well. Additionally, the bank is increasing its loan-loss reserves for the third quarter by $8.5 million before taxes.
