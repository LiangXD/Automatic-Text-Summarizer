TENNIS-HINGIS RULES THE TENNIS WORLD. At age 16 , Martina Hingis of Switzerland has swept aside her last 26 opponents on the fast track to becoming the youngest player ever to grab the top ranking in the world. The latest player to fall to the Hingis combination of speed and tennis smarts was Monica Seles in the final of the Lipton Championships. The execution was swift , as Hingis needed only 44 minutes in a 6-2 6-1 romp. _ It_ 's just like a_little dream comes true right_now , _ said Hingis , who officially took over as queen of tennis when new rankings were released on Monday. _ All the life you work for it and it_ 's getting true , you_ 're becoming the best player in the world. _ Being the best can be an arduous job , but Hingis for now seems immune to the pressures the number one spot can bring. _ I_ 've never had so much fun out_there , _ says Hingis , who became the youngest player to win a Grand Slam title when she won the Australian Open in January. _ If you play well , you know you can beat almost everybody in the world. Surprisingly mature for her age , Hingis never appears intimidated by opponents or anything_else. I still ca_ n't go out , I still ca_ n't do that because I_ 'm underage everywhere. _ Everywhere , that is , except in the world of tennis.
