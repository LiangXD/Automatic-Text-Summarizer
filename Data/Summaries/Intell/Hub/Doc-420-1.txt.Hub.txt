IN THE NAME OF GOD, MOST GRACIOUS MOST MERCYFUL So this is the reality we're living in al-Anbar in general, and Ramadi in particular, that is the head Sheiks of some tribes, and symbols of the Islamic Party, sat with the Americans in Jordan, and other places, to fight terrorism and its people. The Sheiks started teaching people about these ideas, this conspiracy is led by two sides, the first is the heads of the tribes, the second is the leaders of the Islamic Party and mosques speakers, so they announced their war on the Mujahidin, it increased during the elections for the new constitution, their danger was so great, that hundreds of people volunteered in the police and the army, and thousands of people participated in the elections, renouncing their religion, and listenning to the erratics. After we took a look at the situation, we found that the best solutions to stop thousands of people from renouncing their religion, is to cut the heads of the Sheiks of infidelity and erratic. From what we saw, the damage caused by those erratic infidels (Tribes Sheiks, The Islamic Party) is more dangerous than the Shiites and the peaceful police as people call them. My Sheik, here's some of the events that happened in Ramadi: 1- Sheik Nasr al-Fahdawi, Sheik of AlbuFahd tribe, was nominated to be the governor of Anbar, this man worked so hard fighting the (Tanzim)organization, with all he's got, from money to power, and reputation in Ramadi, so we tried this @ with him: First, we backed off during the elections, they had checkpoints, using tens of his tribesmen who started checking cars, they violated our brothers many times, they even announced it, then our brothers attacked the field leader, the brain behind people revolting at al-Anbar in AlbuFahd, so the brothers raided his house in the middle of the night wearing the national guards uniform and driving similar cars, they took him and killed him thank god. The next morning his households and neighbors started talking to the tribe saying it was the national guards, they added that they heard some of them speaking English, meaning that the Americans are the ones who took Abu Dhari (Sheik Nasr al-Fahdawi), no one claimed responsibility for his killing, thank god. 3- After our brothers killed three of the infidels in AlbuFahd, some of them claimed he's for Jihad, at the same time, protects with his soldiers the election centers, and encourages people to volunteers in the police force and the Iraqi army, and it was the second hit for Nasr al-Fahdawi. For the other tribes, their reaction was as follows: 1- Sheik of al-Bubali tribe in al-Jazira, Sheik Sarhan, who's one of the traitors, and every time one of their traitors gets killed, he shows outrage and packs his tribe with their guns against the brothers, after the cleaning in AlbuFahd, the brothers killed three of the spies in his tribe, and for the first time there was no reaction against the brothers, but instead he came to them, asking for forgiveness, and he's ready to cooperate. 2- Sheik of Albu'Ubaid (Salah al-Dhari), who slaughtered thirty sheeps in one dinner party, where he invited heads and Sheiks of tribes in Ramadi, to encourage their youth to join the police and the national guard, and that's two days before the murder of Sheik Nasr al-Fahdawi, after that he announced his repentance at the mosque twice infront of Albu'Ubaid tribe, denouncing who joins the police and army, and sorry for all he's done, without any pressure or threats from the brothers, also the brothers didn't announce the claim for any of the killings. The same with the killing of Muhammad Saddak the Sheik of AlbuJlayb tribe, and president of al-Anbar revolutionists, who released statements in mosques and markets, promising to eliminate who he called Sheiks of sodomite and thift, and agents for the Zionists, like our brother Abu Mustafa Midhatt, our brother Abu Khattab, and Sheik Abu al-Harith al-Shar'i, and many others, this vicious organization (al-Anbar revolutionists) attempted to assasinate our brother Abu Khudayr, in Ramadi, when armed men shot him, was injured in the thigh. As for the heads of the Islamic Party, our brothers been monitoring them for so long, but ignored them during the elections, then their vicious role appeared, with their call to form police and army after the elections, we found that the main thinker behind the Party's ideas is Sheik Abd al-Ghafur al-Kubaysi the Imam and speaker of of al-Shafi'i mosque in Ramadi, and made his mosque the center of all the Party's meetings, with all that, he didn't stop fighting the brothers with his speeches at the mosque, so the brothers assasinated him near his house, after he left the mosque going home, and there was no reaction by the Islamic Party or people, except that they raised signs condemning the killing. The same thing exactly happened after the killing of Abu Bilal in Ramadi, the manager of the media office at the Islamic Party as it was announced in some media sources, he disallowed and torn any Jihad related posters on the walls, he was caught in the act by the brothers, they beat him and arrested him, he routed out lots of the Party's leaders, like Abd al-Ghafur al-Kubaysi, and their conspiracies against the Tanzim (al- Qa'ida organization), he was ill, got transferred to a hospital where he later died, there were no puplicity to his death by people, expect condemning it by the corrupted satellite channels. We did not follow this policy until we ran out of time, from past experience where we let things go, like Kataib al-Hamza (Hamza brigades), and AlbuMahal tribe in al-Qaim, where we should've eliminated them then, but what happened happened, also Muhsin Abd al-Hamid etc... and you Sheik said that yourself god bless you, also in Fallujah where brothers neglected on killing the heads of infidelity, and what happened also happened. Other groups pretends that they never killed an Iraqi or Sunni in particular, and that its goals are patriotic, what we know about our Jihad, that it's Jihad of faith, and what you stated over and over before my Sheik about the method of the group, and the honorable resistance in many of the speeches to our brothers and people, in fact Sheik we are joyous for forming the state council, although we say, to save this blessed work, which we pray to god that Islam and muslims would benefit from it, everyone should agree on our policy in the war against the renegade, without these restrictions we have at the state council. We have no problem with you saying for us to give the name of the person before killing him, but we owe god, this will only be a delay for us, and time is not on our side, and for you to say to kill him outside his city, sometimes it take months before the person leaves his city, like if it's in Baghdad for example, that's difficult, and time is not on our side, we waited to cut the heads of the renegades in Hit, then 130 renegades came out to us for the reason that we didn't destroy the Islamic Party there, but we're working on it, for example we didn't kill Nasr al-Fahdawi at his home in al-Sajriyah, but the guys waited for him until he got out of the Ramadi province. 8- Zahir Muhammad 'Awwad al-'Ubaydi, manager of Sunni endowment, for attending the last meeting with al-Ja'fari, also for attending a conference in Jordan, that was presesnted to you, he's one of the people calling to form the police and national guard, we'll kill him outside al-Ramadi zone, when he goes to the government building. <LU_ANNOTATE> We have restrictions on beheading the heads of the Islamic Party members, the Sheik of the tribes, and renegages, present it to the council if you prefer: 1- There must be time priorities. 8- Differenciate between targets in the Islamic Party, or the Ba'ath Party, who proved their failur to people in running the nation, and Sheiks and leaders of the tribes where most people especially in villages love and respect them, the first kind's reaction is lefting signs and comdemning, the second kind blames, and sometime opens a front against us.
