Jerry's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately. But Jerry's troubles didn't end there. It took some time and hard work, but with the help of Goodwill, Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor's office, find housing and conduct a more thorough job search. Of the more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999, over 5,000 of them have multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job. Some, like Jerry, are ex-offenders. For as long as he needs it, Goodwill will continue to help. And, with your assistance, Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job.
