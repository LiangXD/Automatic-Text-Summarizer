Lim Yun-suk SEOUL 1996-08-20 South Korea's militant students find themselves isolated from a hostile public as they press a violent campaign for reunification with North Korea. But as democracy began to take root and communism crumbled worldwide , many students abandoned their socialist leanings. _ Students calling for reunification is fine , but their method is too violent and extreme , _ said Kim Ho-jin , a professor at Korea University. _ The government also is to blame as they cracked down too harshly , _ he added. No one but the government. _ _ If the government had done a better job with South-North Korea relations , students would have no reason to be out_there. As the government is confused about its North Korea policy , how can we blame the students ? _ he said. The students support Pyongyang's vision for a reunified Korea that would leave the governments of both Koreas intact. But reunification is another matter as many have been through the war , _ said Kim at Korea University. _ The students are simply calling for reunification because we are one.
