More Drivers Texting at Wheel Despite State Bans, Study Finds Read more: http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2011/12/08/more-drivers-texting-at-wheel-despite-state-bans-study-finds/?test=afut#ixzz1qpHTQbz7 WASHINGTON – For all the criticism and new legal bans, texting by drivers just keeps increasing, especially among younger motorists. At any given moment last year on America's streets and highways, nearly one in every 100 car drivers was texting, emailing, surfing the Web or otherwise using a hand-held electronic device, the safety administration said. In 2010 there were an estimated 3,092 deaths in crashes affected by a wide range of driver distractions, from eating meals to thumbing email, the safety administration said. And nearly two of 10 acknowledged sending texts or emails from behind the wheel. That spiked up to half of drivers 21 to 24 years old. More than half of drivers said making a cellphone call made no difference to their driving performance, and a quarter said texting or emailing made no difference. But 90 percent said that when they are passengers they feel very unsafe if the driver is texting or emailing. Indeed, big majorities of drivers surveyed support bans on hand-held cellphone use and texting while driving -- 71 percent and 94 percent, respectively. About twice as many drivers reported answering incoming calls as making calls while driving, 71 percent to 41 percent. And more drivers reported reading than sending texts or emails. There were very few situations in which drivers said they would never talk on the phone or send texts. Many drivers won't stop texting until they fear getting a ticket. Before and after each enforcement wave, NHTSA researchers observed cellphone use by drivers and conducted surveys at drivers' license offices in the two cities. They found that in Syracuse, hand-held cellphone use and texting declined by a third. But safety advocates are pushing for a national ban on texting while driving.
