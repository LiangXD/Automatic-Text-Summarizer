A couple of weeks ago, the federal government distributed a colourful announcement in newspapers across the land proclaiming that the Earth is getting warmer and that implementing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, on the targeted reduction of so-called greenhouse gases, would fix things. Herb Dhaliwal, the federal Energy Minister, weighed in with even more qualifications: Some important details have to be worked out before Canada ratifies the Kyoto Protocol, he said. According to Jean Chretien, the desire of the federal government is to sign it. Lorne Taylor, the Alberta Environment Minister, estimated the costs of Kyoto to the Canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year. He was alluding to the great money laundering operation whereby the federal government transfers cash from productive provinces such as Alberta and dispenses it in places such as Quebec. At the same conference, Taylor's federal counterpart, David Anderson, announced that the Alberta numbers were absurd. Implementing Kyoto would cost a paltry $500-million, he said, and added more ominously that the issue, technically, is that international relations fall within the purview of the federal government. There are two levels to the controversy around Kyoto. The first, as the numbers tossed about by Taylor and Anderson indicate, is centred on costs of compliance. Canadians know, with a certainty approaching perfection, that the federal government is incompetent when it comes to offering even order-of-magnitude guesses. The fact is, Kyoto is without principles and no one has a clue what it means. As a consequence, only the politics of Kyoto count. Swelling the population of envirocrats in Ottawa means that the sole beneficiary is the federal government.
