Stephanopoulos Analyzes His Own Crime There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week this morning, furrow-browed and heartbroken with all the evidence coming out against the president. Stephanopoulos wants to run for the Senate and doesn't want to seem a Clinton stooge. By lending credence to the Lewinsky charges, and treating Clinton's familiar defenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, Stephanopoulos shows he's not a fool. The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in the first place. Simply put, Stephanopoulos did as much as any man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments. Clinton has no character problem, Stephanopoulos declares. Donaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted to infidelity. Near the end of The War Room, Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours, which he is about to publicize. Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping quiet. You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection techniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught. When Democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton, they don't need to look much further than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos, Carville (and a cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992. Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the country.
