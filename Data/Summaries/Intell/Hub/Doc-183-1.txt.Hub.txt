Following the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the world's sole superpower and the trend of pragmatism in its foreign policy has become clearer and clearer. Pragmatism is, in the first place, the United States' traditional policy. Despite the opposition, Bush went it alone. At one time, he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race; on another occasion, he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was a product of the Cold War era, and thus has lost its binding force. He even claimed that to develop the NMD, the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM. Since coming to power, Bush, proceeding from the US immediate interests, has also adopted the pragmatism and unilateralism position with regard to international treaties. The Bush administration either refuses to sign, ratify, or implement international treaties or asks for their revision. Supported by the world, the United States launched the war against terrorism of this century. Bush stressed that the war is not only the US war but also a world war. The United States views itself as a major force of anti-terrorism, for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism. Bush said, Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists and any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime. The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country's attitude toward it. But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it.
