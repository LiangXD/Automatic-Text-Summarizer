It retained, however, the same mission with which it had been charged from its inception: to serve as a catalyst for effective, coordinated, and collaborative service delivery to youth in our community. As a team, these three organizations are working with neighborhood youth and adults to build a Caring Neighborhood with Youth , mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a better neighborhood for all. Since its re-organization, MCCOY has established its unique niche within the community by refraining from direct service programming and focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs, and moving toward collaborative solutions. McCoy has only one interest: the well being of Marion County's young people. McCoy invites the support of The __ Company Foundation in the amount of $10,000.00 to support such activities as: ---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhood-based youth councils; ---- the promotion of youth employment opportunities; ---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery; ---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youth-adult relationships; ---- the development of community-wide supports for the positive growth of all Marion County young people. We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people can grow and develop well. We believe there is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community as a whole.
