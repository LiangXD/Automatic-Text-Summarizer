AMMAN -- A three-day workshop on money laundering started on Monday, with the participation of officials from several Arab banks, discussing the impact and size of this problem in the Middle East. Participants will also explore the role of banking and financial institutions in combating money laundering and the American and European approaches to fighting this problem. Our institutions are far away from this money laundering phenomenon and Arab governments have amended banking laws to combat money laundering, Shakir said. Jordan was among the Arab countries which introduced measures to fight this problem including tightening banking rules and imposing strict controls on money transfers. According to Shakir, money laundering in the Arab world is very minimal but he said that Lebanon and Egypt are classified by international agencies as among the countries that have not taken necessary measures to combat this problem.
