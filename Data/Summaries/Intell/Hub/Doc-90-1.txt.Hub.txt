A string of economic reports , including the key jobs report , which is scheduled for release Friday , was one factor keeping investors sidelined , but traders said last week's selloff also was a factor. _ As far as buying , there has_ n't been a lot , _ the trader in Chicago said. _ Everyone is just holding their breath. _ Nobody is paying up for the puts _ where premiums remained rich , he said , adding that some investors were buying puts , expecting a bounce. One broker in Chicago said some investors were attempting to play the OEX options , but wide spreads and stiff premiums made them difficult to trade. He agreed activity was quiet. _ The market goes down and nobody wants to do anything , _ he said. _ If we get some kind of a reversal , I_ 'm sure we_ 'll get some action. _ Some analysts continued to look for some quarter-ending portfolio buying to emerge and support the market , but others noted that investor complacency appeared to be high , which is a bearish sign in a declining market. Jerry Hegarty , an analyst at Thomson Financial Services , said in a report that by afternoon , OEX put buying topped call buying by only 6,000 contracts despite the market's drop. Although options trading indicated investor complacency , some indicators suggested bearishness was on the rise , which is bullish for contrarians. Joseph Sunderman , an analyst at Investment Research Institute in Cincinnati , said in a report that investor sentiment has turned _ decisively _ bearish on stocks.
