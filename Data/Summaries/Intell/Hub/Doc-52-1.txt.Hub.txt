While problems with the surgically implanted product—used to treat incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse (POP)—have been suspected and alleged for years, only recently did the FDA acknowledge that Bard mesh and its various cousins may not be the best treatment option related to the aforementioned issues. In the absence of an Avaulta mesh recall, the FDA announced in July that it is requiring all transvaginal (TVM) mesh manufacturers to devote the next three years to post-market testing. The agency, however, appears unwilling to formally revoke approval of the mesh products, including Bard Avaulta mesh, for that indication. In practice, TVM mesh products—Bard mesh among them—have presented a myriad of health issues for women. For some patients, the mesh has affected intimacy with a spouse or partner. Ironically, with some patients for whom the Avaulta pelvic mesh was intended to resolve incontinence problems, symptoms of incontinence persisted.
