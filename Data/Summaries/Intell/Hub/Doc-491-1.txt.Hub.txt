On Thursday the Arab Summit in the Lebanese capital of Beirut ended with the adoption of a resolution whose content illustrated how far the Arab world has come since the summit that took place in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum in 1967, shortly after the Israeli victory in the Six Days War. On Thursday the summit adopted a resolution that proposed the recognition of the Jewish state, normal relations, and an end to the conflict in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that Israel has occupied for almost 35 years. The resolution that was put forward by Saudi Arabia was a plea addressed to the Israeli people over the heads of Ariel Sharon's government. The resolution forced him into a corner. He was known to the Israeli intelligence service. His name figured on a list that Israel had shortly before handed over to the Palestinian security service. That same night the Israeli security cabinet met. They decided to take steps to destroy the Palestinian terrorist structure, arrest its leaders, confiscate arms, and so on. As a first step Israeli forces were sent into the main Palestinian town, Ramallah, where Arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous Palestinian areas are administered. Now he declared that Arafat was an enemy. The Palestinian Authority has effectively ceased to function. According to these sources, Sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while Arafat hesitated. It cannot solve the Israeli people's security problems, because the root of the terrorism is the Israeli occupation and the Israeli settlements on occupied territory. The settlers, who number around 220,000 people, have taken the Israeli Government and consequently both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples hostage. The day the Israeli tanks again leave Ramallah they will have sown the seed for new terrorist actions.
