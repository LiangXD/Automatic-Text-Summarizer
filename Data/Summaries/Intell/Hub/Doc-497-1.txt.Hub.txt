BETHANY - The number of illegal immigrants in Swaziland seems to be increasing. We have discovered that there is a certain family around Lomahasha, which is suspected of assisting illegal immigrants with shelter and transport. Last month, 53 cattle were also stolen around the country, of which 17 were spotted inside Mozambique driven by three men armed with rifles thought to be AK47s.
