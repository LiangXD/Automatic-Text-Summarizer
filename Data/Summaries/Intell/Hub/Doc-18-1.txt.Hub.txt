PONTE VEDRA BEACH , Florida 1997-03-30 Steve Elkington birdied the first four holes on the first day and never looked back , beating the best field in PGA history to win the Players Championship by a record seven strokes Sunday. Billy Andrade struggled to a 74 and was fifth at 282 , just in front of 1996 Player of the Year Tom Lehman , who had a 72. _ I basically blew away the best field we_ 've ever had , and it_ 's something I did_ n't know I was capable of. For the first time in PGA Tour history , the top 50 players in the world rankings were entered in the same event. Elkington's margin of victory broke the record of five strokes set by Lanny Wadkins in 1979 and matched by Nick Price four years ago. Elkington squandered half of a four-shot lead when he bogeyed the final two holes Saturday. His birdie at the par-3 eighth hole extended his lead to six shots. The final birdie came on the 18th hole when Elkington chipped in from 30 feet. _ I chuckled to myself that that_ 's the way it goes when you_ 're playing well , _ Elkington said. He dropped two strokes over the first four holes and stumbled to a 2-over 74 for 9-under 279. _ After the 14th hole or so it would have taken an act of God for me to catch him. Elkington assured himself of the biggest win margin and a fourth straight sub-70 round when he birdied the par-4 18th $-- a nice turnaround from his bogey-bogey finish on Saturday. _ Steve's a ( Nick ) Faldo-like player in that he can keep it in play and make pars when he has to and never give up the lead , _ Faxon said. Faldo had four rounds of 71 or better for par 288. Woods , playing in his first Players Championship , also was 71 or worse in each round and finished at 1-over 289.
