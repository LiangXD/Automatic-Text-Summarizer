We don't know who is winning the drug war in Latin America, but we know who's losing it -- the press. Over the past six months, six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas -- who often are one and the same -- in Colombia. The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America, the United States, the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey, Mexico, this week. The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspaper's offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin. At Monterrey, publisher Luis Gabriel Cano, although shaken by the murders, issued a statement saying: We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking. They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war. A final statement yesterday said: While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere, the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship: death by assassination. The report charged that Panama's Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere, repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever. And in Nicaragua, promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas have not materialized. As it happens, the four countries cited, Colombia, Cuba, Panama and Nicaragua, are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left-wing politics. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that. </LU_ANNOTATE WC=139>
