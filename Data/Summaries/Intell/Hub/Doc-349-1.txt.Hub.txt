New man for a new NASA mission Forget space shuttles, orbiting telescopes, and more robotic rovers on Mars. The next mission for NASA could be to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program. O'Keefe is not known as a space enthusiast, says Keith Cowing, a former NASA scientist and editor of NASAWatch.com. Today, we have 13 in space and 27 under development. But the agency's credibility has come under fire in manned spaceflight - especially the International Space Station, now completing its first year of full-time crews. Early on, the Bush administration planned to scale back US involvement to a core station with a crew of three instead of six. And this month, a task force on the project's budget concluded that NASA's cost estimate for finishing the core station between 2002 and 2008 is not credible. Goldin's was to cut NASA's budget. Now O'Keefe's is to fix the space station. O'Keefe's appointment is a clear message from the administration: NASA has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we'd like to see NASA do, says Patricia Dasch of the National Space Society.
