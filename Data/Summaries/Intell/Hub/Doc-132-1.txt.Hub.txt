Ramsamy also condemned last Tuesday's terror attacks in the United States. The SADC secretariat condemns unreservedly and in the strongest terms this act of terrorism, he said. We are grateful for the strong support expressed by the international community, particularly the SADC member states. Ramsamy also read a joint statement made on Thursday at the close of a meeting of SADC foreign and finance ministers in Blantyre, Malawi, labelling the terror attacks ghastly and barbaric. We strongly condemn this ghastly and barbaric act of terrorism and wanton destruction of property and the loss of innocent lives.
