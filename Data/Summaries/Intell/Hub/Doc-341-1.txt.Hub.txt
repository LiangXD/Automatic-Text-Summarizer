Africa's Grand Bargain All was not lost in Zimbabwe's rigged election last week. This grand bargain to uplift the world's poorest continent would have been in jeopardy if Thabo Mbeki, south Africa's president, and Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's president, had not agreed to suspend Zimbabwe from the 54-nation group of former British colonies known as the Commonwealth. The grand pact, known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, was initiated by the two leaders. Mbeki and other African leaders need to press Mr. Mugabe to stop his repression and to not take farmland from whites without just compensation. Such desperation by Mugabe should not be condoned by African leaders. South Africa's leader, Mbeki, who has been inclined toward quiet diplomacy with Zimbabwe, has now made himself heard.
