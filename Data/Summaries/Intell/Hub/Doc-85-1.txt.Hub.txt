USA : US YIELD CURVE $- Bills said the place to be for now. US YIELD CURVE $- Bills said the place to be for now. Bills $-- primarily three $- and six-month $-- have outperformed the rest of the yield curve since last Tuesday's quarter-point rate hike by the Fed. The six-month bill rate was at 5.31 percent , down about five basis points from early last week. Traders noted that the near term directon of the curve and whether bills can hold at what is perceived to be 10 basis points too expensive lies with Friday's March employment report. _ If we get a weaker jobs report and people say the Fed will ( skip ) the next tightening ( in May ) , we may see bills start to loosen up , _ said a trader at a Japanese-based dealer.
