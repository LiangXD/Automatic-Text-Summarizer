As for the globally felt benefits that would follow from Canada's implementation of the Kyoto protocol, they are slight. By 2010, our $40-billion sacrifice would yield an expected reduction in annual carbon and carbon-equivalent emissions of about 46-million tonnes -- just 1/200th of the world's total projected greenhouse gas output. Even if Canada managed to convince the United States and every other Kyoto signatory to ratify the protocol, world carbon dioxide emissions would still soar. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, world energy consumption will increase by about 60% between now and 2020, with most of the upsurge expected to come from developing nations, which are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Under the fully implemented treaty, carbon dioxide emissions would grow 26% during the 1990-2010 period. Without Kyoto, the figure would be 34%. Instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions -- a costly burden at home and an impossible task in the developing world -- we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. While helping Third World nations plant new crops, vaccinate people and relocate coastal towns will be costly, the bottom line will likely be only a fraction of Kyoto's 13-digit price tag.
