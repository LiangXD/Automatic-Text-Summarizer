Last week alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc., a Boston research firm. In the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says. It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds. Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months. If the heavy outflows continue, fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead. The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $32 billion. Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds, too. The $1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $150 million in the past two months. The fund now holds a cash position of about 15%. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors yanked out about $182 million in the past two months. Fidelity's junk fund has fallen 2.08% this year through Oct. 19, Lipper says; the Vanguard fund rose 1.84%; and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66%. People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again, some analysts and fund specialists say. And then, asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far.
