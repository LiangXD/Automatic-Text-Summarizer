I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes, so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need. Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories. Much of it, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some very good stories. So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to watch. I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man--at AOL, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other characters, for lack of a better word. Steve Ballmer, of course, is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft, but it still seems to be Bill's show over there. While I did not attend the trial--I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good. From where I am sitting, I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age. Will the strongman of the era be AOL, AT&T, Microsoft, or one of the big media companies? I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whether it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney--is in charge of all our destinies: Babylon was.
