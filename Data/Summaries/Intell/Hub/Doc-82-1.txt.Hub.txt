And it_ 's a great time to sell a business because the values are high , _ said Bruce Nolop , managing director at investment banking boutique Wasserstein Perella & Co. The record $183 billion in total transactions announced in the first quarter eclipsed the previous first-quarter record of $120.6 billion set in 1995 , according_to Newark , N.J.-based Securities Data Co. , which tracks merger activity. The banking industry , which had settled down after a frenzy of activity in 1995 and early 1996 , came charging back in early 1997 with $16.5 billion in announced transactions. _ You_ 're likely to see quite a_few more of these mega-transactions as banks seek to establish themselves as one of the four or five regional survivors that we_ 're all expecting to see by the beginning of the next century , _ said Oliver Sarkozy , director in the financial institutions merger and acquisition department of CS First Boston Corp. The quarter's largest transaction was the announced $10.6 billion merger between Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Dean Witter , Discover & Co. , a deal that is expected to have a ripple effect through the U.S. securities industry.
