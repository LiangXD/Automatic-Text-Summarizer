Call it Club Gitmo. Still, some people just have to bash the United States. Take the sensory deprivation charge. Does Amnesty International think that wearing a hood on an airplane is sensory deprivation, instead of a security measure? Isn't the Taliban code all about sensory deprivation? As for the unnecessary restraint, one detainee has announced that he wants to kill an American before he leaves Cuba, and another detainee bit a guard, according to Pentagon spokesman Capt. I'd guess that's one journalist who's never been to a prison. Then there's the status of the detainees. Some Brits and Amnesty International want them to be officially classified as POWs. You could understand the outrage if the U.S. military were torturing or otherwise mistreating the detainees. Instead, Amnesty International and the comrades are outraged that the military is treating al Qaeda captives like prisoners.
