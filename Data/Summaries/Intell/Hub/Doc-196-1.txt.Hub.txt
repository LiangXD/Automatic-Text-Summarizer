Clwyd said the purpose of meeting Farish was to to voice concern about the treatment of all the people taken prisoner in Afghanistan, not just the ones being held in Cuba, and we want an acceptance that they are prisoners of war. She added that there was substantial concern among Labour members and called for a government statement on the situation. It's time we had a clear statement on the position of the prisoners and what the British role now is. The government has sent a team of officials to the camp to assess the conditions of the British prisoners.
