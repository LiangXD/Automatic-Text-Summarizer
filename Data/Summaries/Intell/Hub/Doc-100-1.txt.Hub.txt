USA : Government to host auction for nationwide radio. Government to host auction for nationwide radio. Up for grabs are two licenses to provide radio programming that will be beamed coast-to-coast via satellite. The FCC resolved a long-standing dispute among its four commissioners in early March by limiting the auction to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital radio. But in the end they agreed reluctantly to limit the auction so the launch of digital radio would not be delayed further. _ The decision to keep the auction door closed may needlessly cost the public millions of dollars , _ Hundt said when the agency announced its decision. Hundt said that if other companies value the digital radio airwaves but are _ arbitrarily excluded from the auction , it is safe to predict that the auction winners will simply sell their licenses to those companies. _ Aside_from DBSC , the other three bidders are : CD Radio Inc. of Washington , D.C. ; American Mobile Radio Corp. , a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston , Va. ; and Primosphere LP of New York.
