Oracle has contended that Google should pay hundreds of millions of dollars on that claim, which is separate from the two patents. In the Tuesday court filing, Google proposed paying Oracle roughly $2.8 million in damages on two patents, covering the period through 2011. For future damages, Google proposed paying Oracle 0.5 percent of Android revenue on one patent until it expires this December and 0.015 percent on a second patent until it expires in April 2018.
