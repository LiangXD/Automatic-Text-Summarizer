Dr Eric Edwards of the Shellfish Association says : & bquo ; Customer reaction is that they are stylish and upmarket. & equo ; Demand in Europe and North America continues to rise by 4 per_cent a year $- despite the fact that natural sources are already overfished. Traditionally , prawn farmers have trapped these young adults ( or & bquo ; post-larvae & equo ; as they are called ) and put them into ponds. A team led by Dr David Jones , of Bangor '_ s renowned School of Ocean Sciences , designed a revolutionary new feed , using a process called microencapsulation which puts a thin , digestible membrane around each tiny food particle. & bquo ; It '_ s exactly the same , essentially , as making nylon , & equo ; he says. & bquo ; To do that , you take a_lot_of identical molecules called amines and join them together to form a chain. Then you take an acid chloride , and dissolve it in another liquid which wo n't mix with the first one. & bquo ; When you put the two together , the cross-linking reaction occurs , and all the amine molecules at the interface of the two liquids join together in a polymer. By drawing the polymer off , new cross-links are formed and you go on drawing the thread until all the constituents are used up. & bquo ; Now if , instead_of having a single interface between the two liquids , you emulsify the two ( like oil and vinegar in French dressing ) the reaction occurs over the surface of each suspended droplet , creating a capsule. & equo ; Originally , the team mixed prawn nutrients with amines , thinking that they would be needed to form the capsule. But it soon became obvious that the proteins of the nutrient contained the correct chemical groups , and that the food molecules themselves were polymerizing and creating the capsule membrane. & bquo ; Haemoglobin , chicken egg and many other natural proteins are rich in the important chemical groups , and these cross-link without any problem at all. The first membranes they made were far too thin and would not survive transfer into air , let_alone freeze-drying. & bquo ; Once we had solved the thickness problem , it became a commercial possibility , & equo ; says Dr Jones , & bquo ; and Mars ? the people who make the chocolate bars ? became interested. Developing the diet has had great scientific spin-offs. & bquo ; It '_ s amazing that a multi-million pound industry was built on an animal nobody knew anything about , & equo ; Dr Jones says. & bquo ; We have 50 years of data on the chicken or the pig. None of this had been done for the prawn. & bquo ; Through refining our feed , by leaving things out and seeing what happens , we have been able to define the dietary requirements of the prawn throughout its development. We '_ ve learnt an enormous amount because the microcapsule is such an ideal tool for simplifying and controlling food intake. & equo ; Dr Jones and his team are now extending their work to other species , and to the post-larval stage , which leads to the ultimate product ? the prawn on the end of your fork. And expertise gained has enabled the university to launch a new MSc course in shellfish biology , fisheries and culture ? due_to take its first students in the coming academic year. & bquo ; The commercial aspects are very good , of_course ? though I still find the teaching and research spin-offs the most exciting part of it all , & equo ; says Dr Jones. But Dr Jones '_ s involvement with industry has led him into difficulties ? which lend a critical edge to the parable. & bquo ; Frippak support our work generously , & equo ; he says. & bquo ; But they are understandably reluctant to pay for research students , because they will probably go off and join the competition. The project '_ s got alpha ratings , but the council saw the industrial involvement and said & bquo ; Go to industry ? we '_ re short_of money & equo ;. & bquo ; It '_ s a real Catch 22 situation. Once you get working with industry , there '_ s a feeling that industry must pay for everything. But I do n't see why they should be asked to shoot themselves in the foot by paying to train a competitor '_ s workforce , and neither do they ! & equo ; The end result is that Dr Jones takes on overseas researchers. & bquo ; That '_ s fine as far as I am concerned & equo ; he says. & bquo ; They do n't cost British industry or taxpayers a thing , but of_course they take all their expertise abroad. & bquo ; Whatever the Government '_ s idea is , I do n't think that '_ s it , somehow. & equo ;
