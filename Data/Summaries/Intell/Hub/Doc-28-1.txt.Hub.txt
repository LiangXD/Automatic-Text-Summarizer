Japan PM vows to push new law for U.S. bases. Japan PM vows to push new law for U.S. bases. Eugene Moosa TOKYO 1997-03-31 Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto , moving to tackle his biggest political problem , vowed on Monday to push through legislation to extend land leases for U.S. military bases beyond a May deadline. The new legislation will , in effect , give the Japanese government a temporary extension of its leases on land occupied by the U.S. bases after the current contracts expire. Without the proposed revisions to the land laws , the government would be _ illegally _ occupying the land. Private land for U.S. bases is expropriated by the Japanese government , not the U.S. military itself.
