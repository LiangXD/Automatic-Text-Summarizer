STRASBOURG, Nov 29 (AFP) -- Three leading international organisations warned jointly Thursday [29 November] that the international fight against terrorism should not be a pretext for the violation of human rights. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, Walter Schwimmer, Secretary General of the Council of Europe and Ambassador Gerard Stoudmann of the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights said it was essential that states strictly adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism. The statement listed what it said were essential rights that could not be hollowed out because of the fight against terrorism.
