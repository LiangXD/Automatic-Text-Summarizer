In search of the most valuable GEMs of all Malcolm Smith on the importance of genetically-engineered micro-organisms. LOSING your favourite gems may be a personal disaster. But losing GEMs could have much farther reaching implications. GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital. Link: [Comments: zero anaphor of GEMS] There are so many bacteria everywhere that picking out a GEM is a_bit like looking for a candle amongst Blackpool '_ s illumination. But the snag is that first you have to be able to recover the GEMs to culture them to do the catechol yellowing test. Their method has been designed for recovering a GEM from water ? not easy because any bacteria in it are much less abundant than , say in soil. This GEM ? like most bacteria ? is n't the smooth cell shape that it looks. Suspended in water , only the GEM for which the antibodies were specific will attach to the beads. The beads plus GEM are recovered with a magnet. Once you have the GEMs on the polystyrene spheres they can be washed off and cultured for testing with catechol or other techniques. This research , to enable identification of a released GEM ? and its whereabouts ? is essential because_of the risks involved in letting GEMs out_of the laboratory. There are concerns that , once released , GEMs might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria. There are also fears that a genetic mutation ? over which there could be no control ? could suddenly produce a GEM with some nasty trick up its sleeve. Engineering a time delayed & bquo ; lethal gene & equo ; into a GEM to give it a finite life ? making it sensitive to low air temperatures so that frost kills it ? is one way. Doubling up on & bquo ; lethal genes & equo ; ? by making a GEM both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ? is a belt and braces approach.
