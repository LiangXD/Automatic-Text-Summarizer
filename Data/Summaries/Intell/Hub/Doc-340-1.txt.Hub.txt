Russia disagrees with 'axis' remark MUNICH, Germany -- Russia's defense minister said Sunday that his country disagrees with the U.S. view of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil." 11. Foreign Minister Sergei Ivanov told a global conference of government and military leaders that he sees no evidence that any of the three nations supports terrorism and insisted that any move against them must follow international law. President Bush described Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil" during his State of the Union address on Jan. Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino, meanwhile, said Sunday that his country would not support an attack on Iraq without "proven proof" that Baghdad is supporting al Qaeda, and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein dispatched a delegation to meet with European Union leaders in Spain. Ivanov said the West uses a double standard in its definition of terrorism, asking why members of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network are terrorists, but not Chechen separatists fighting Russia. "Well, we don't like some of your allies like Saudi Arabia or Gulf states who give finance to terrorism organizations," Ivanov said. Sunday's final session also underscored the vast differences between the United States and Russia.
