The country was no longer the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in honour of South American independence hero Simon Bolivar, one of former president Hugo Chavez's heroes. Shellshocked Managers were striking because Mr Chavez had filled the company's board of directors with his supporters. The country is in shellshock. As marchers called for Mr Chavez's resignation outside Miraflores, the presidential palace, shots were fired into the crowd. Film footage also caught armed supporters of Mr Chavez firing indiscriminately at the marchers. Chavez's last day At the time, Mr Chavez was addressing the nation to assure them his government respected people's right to demonstrate and freedom of the press. As tanks surrounded Miraflores, Mr Chavez was holed up with senior military officers in a bid to save his presidency. In the early hours of the morning, chief of the armed forces General Lucas Rincon held a brief news conference to say Mr Chavez's resignation had been demanded and accepted. News of Mr Chavez's resignation caused hundreds of flag-waving and whistle-blowing Venezuelans to surround the city's air force base, La Carlota, in the hope of seeing Mr Chavez' departure from the country. I think people are happy because Chavez has fallen.
