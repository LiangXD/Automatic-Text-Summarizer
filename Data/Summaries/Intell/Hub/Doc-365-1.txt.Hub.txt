Mugabe Predicts Victory in Zimbabwe's Election Zimbabwe's incumbent President Robert Mugabe Saturday predicted victory in the country's two- horse presidential race, saying that he will accept the outcome of the election because he will have defeated Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). I will accept the results more than anything because I will have won, said Mugabe. Tension has risen sharply in Zimbabwe in recent months, after long and sometimes violent election campaigns. While defying international pressure to back down from his controversial land reforms, Mugabe has said he needs a new six- year mandate to complete the reforms. The controversial land reform is the pillar of Mugabe's electoral strategy, which political analysts say could work either way. In Mugabe's view, the March election is a new chapter in his long struggle against colonial rule, which he led from the early 1960s until the country's independence.
