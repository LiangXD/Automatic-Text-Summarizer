Koizumi left for Beijing on Monday morning an hour after the originally scheduled time and will return to Tokyo two hours earlier than scheduled, the officials said. But, Koizumi has not changed his plan to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site of the 1937 clash that led to an eight-year war between Japan and China, and a nearby museum commemorating China's anti-Japanese movement, they said.
