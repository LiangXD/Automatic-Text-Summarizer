Sun, a maker of computer workstations, reported sales of $538.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. One of those new computers, called Sparcstation 1, accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter, he said. But problems in manufacturing, forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for Sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer. These problems also resulted in Sun reporting a $20.3 million loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30.
