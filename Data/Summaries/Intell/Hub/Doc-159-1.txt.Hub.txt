A container from the Swedish nuclear technology firm Studsvik has leaked radioactive materials. The Swedish and US authorities are looking for people who might have been exposed to dangerous radiation, but there is no indication that the container started to leak in Sweden. According to all indications, the radioactive container sent from the nuclear technology firm Studsvik to the US did not leak during transport within Sweden. When the container was transshipped in Paris, measurements showed no abnormal levels, according to the US Transport Department. The pilot who was supposed to fly the container to the US was equipped with a dosimeter, which measures radiation levels. This means that no leak occurred before the container left Paris. It is still not clear where the iridium container began to leak. The iridium container left Studsvik in Nykoping on 27 December and was shipped via Norrkoping, Arlanda, and Paris to Memphis.
