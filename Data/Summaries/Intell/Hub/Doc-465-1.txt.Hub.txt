Both the White House and the US State Department expressed satisfaction over the stepping-down of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's constitutional president, and no one wept over him. Besides, they also claimed that Chavez had only himself to blame for the coup. This special meeting was initiated by the United States, with only one single goal to fulfill, that is, instigating OPCW member states to vote out Bustani. Why has the United States been picking on Chavez and Bustani all this time? All these are eyesores to the United States. To the United States, what Bustani wanted to do was even more intolerable, as it would disrupt the US plan of launching a military strike against Iraq. Even some major media in the United States have thoroughly unmasked the attitude taken by the US Government towards the cope farce in Venezuela. It will not be a coup so long as the United States thinks it is not!
