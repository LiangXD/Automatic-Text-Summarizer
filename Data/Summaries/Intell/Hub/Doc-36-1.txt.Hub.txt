Already trumpeted as & bquo ; A Mission To Earth & equo ; by Nasa , climate research has gained new prominence , chiming with the rise in environmental concerns the world over. For_once , the UK is in the good books of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) for our support of the European Remote Sensing ( ERS ) programme , which will use the most complex satellites it has ever attempted to build. & bquo ; It '_ s one of the most important projects we have for the 1990s , & equo ; says Philip Goldsmith , head of Earth observation at the European Space Agency. Whilst other space agencies have equally ambitious plans , they remain as blueprints , or , as one European scientist puts it , & bquo ; pie-in-the-sky-eyes-in-the-sky. & equo ; ERS-1 has five instruments which will scan the Earth at microwave wavelengths to monitor ocean , ice and land resources. Two of the ERS instruments have been provided by the UK. Though ESA admits there have been electronic problems with one of the system '_ s processors , it '_ s hardly surprising. & bquo ; It '_ s the most complex instrument we '_ ve ever built , & equo ; says Joe McCaughey , Marconi '_ s project manager. & bquo ; ERS as a whole is a quantum leap for Europe. & equo ; The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire has provided the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer , an infrared instrument which will measure sea surface temperatures down to 0.3C. & bquo ; There are Americans who '_ d give their eye teeth for this sort of data , & equo ; says one ERS project scientist at the laboratory. Commercially , the ATSR data will allow fishing vessels to & bquo ; home in & equo ; on the edges of sea currents where fish congregate to feed on nutrients brought up from the ocean floor. But the emphasis for ERS-1 is science , as the ERS programme is ESA '_ s contribution to Woce , the World Ocean Circulation Experiment , an important part of global climate research in the 1990s. Ice coverage limits the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and ocean , effectively & bquo ; insulating & equo ; polar regions from sunlight during summertime. & bquo ; You '_ d be amazed how little we know about the polar regions , & equo ; says Dr Preben Goodmandsen of the Technical University of Denmark. & bquo ; During the wintertime , there '_ s no sunlight. ERS-1 is expected to return the first quantitive data on these processes at the poles. & bquo ; The key to the ERS programme is continuity , & equo ; says Guy Duchossois of ESA headquarters. Perhaps more importantly , governmental space sources relate that Margaret Thatcher is behind ERS-2. & bquo ; She knows about ERS-2 and is enthusiastic about it , & equo ; says one. It '_ s just a matter of finding the money. & equo ; Next week , in Paris , ESA '_ s governing body of national representatives meets to discuss ERS-2 amongst other future plans.
