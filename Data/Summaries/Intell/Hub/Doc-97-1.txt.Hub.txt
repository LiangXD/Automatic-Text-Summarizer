David Lawder DETROIT 1997-03-31 Continuing at a steady but unspectacular pace , U.S. car and truck sales for March are expected to show gains for Japanese and German automakers at the expense of Detroit's Big Three , analysts said Monday. Both Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are expected to report March sales declines of about 3 percent , compared with a year ago , while General Motors Corp. may post gains of 3 percent to 6 percent over last year's strike-affected results. Chrysler plans to report sales on Tuesday , with GM following Wednesday and Ford on Thursday. Analysts said Japanese automakers are expected to continue increasing sales and market share , based on a hot portfolio of new products coupled with a weak Japanese yen that allows them to price more aggressively. _ It still sounds pretty sloppy. This year's market is very competitive , _ said Schroder Wertheim analyst John Casesa. _ The March numbers are going to show that the market is not as robust as the annual rate suggests. _ Analysts estimate that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for March light vehicle sales will be about 15 million to 15.4 million units , compared with 15.5 million a year ago. As the year drags on , automakers will probably have to fork over increasingly higher incentives to maintain sales rates above 15 million , Casesa said. But GM's improved sales are not expected to be enough to offset the market share gains by Toyota Motor Corp. , Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and other Japanese automakers , particular in the intermediate passenger car market.
