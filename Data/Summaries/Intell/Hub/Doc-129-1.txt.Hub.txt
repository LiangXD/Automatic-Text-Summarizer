This milestone puts Japan's aerospace development program back on track. However, these two rockets are primarily used to launch low orbit satellites. In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket. In November 1999, a multi-purpose satellite was launched by H2 rocket No. After this incident, Japan began to redesign the main engine of the H2 rocket. Eventually, the H2A rocket was developed. In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies. Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development. In the field of satellite communications, Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) spent $310 million to develop the ETS-8 (Engineering Test Satellite 8) satellite. This satellite doubled the capacity of the test satellite previously launched by Japan. This program not only puts Japan in the lead in providing new mobile communication services in the Asia-Pacific region, but also allows Japan to test some new satellite communication techniques to be introduced worldwide. A Japanese made H2A rocket will launch this satellite in 2002. Military surveillance satellites are also included in its development plan. Japan has prepared a military space program and allocated $1.3 billion to implement it. Japan also has a huge space power plant plan. Japan is determined to become a major power in aerospace. Between 1970 and the end of 1999, Japan launched a total of 66 satellites. Japan also has a relatively strong aerospace industry.
