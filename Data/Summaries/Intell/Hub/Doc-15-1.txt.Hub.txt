Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 Lower imports shrank the U.S. trade deficit dramatically in June , the Commerce Department said Tuesday , bolstering the impression of gradual waning in the economy's vigour. While imports of relatively cheap consumer goods from China kept rising , exports to the Asian trade giant fell for a fourth straight month during June to the lowest level since the beginning of 1995 , creating a deficit that Kantor called _ too high. _ Analysts were surprised by the sharp 3.3 percent falloff in overall June imports to $77.82 billion , while exports held up relatively well , falling just 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion. _ It says that exports are providing some underpinning for the U.S. economy but overall it tells us that we have sharply weakened in terms of economic vigour and activity , _ said Roger Shields , head of country risk management for Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. In June , the merchandise deficit fell 13.9 percent to $14.46 billion from $16.79 billion in May. But he warned that it will be hard to keep exports growing. _ The economy is slowing , _ Chimerine said. _ June marked the start of that process and the weak imports were part of it. _ But Europe is bouncing back only slowly , Japan is still wavering and Canada is weak _ as a source of demand for American goods , Chimerine said. _ I do_ n't think we_ 're going to see a_lot_of progress on lowering the trade deficit for the rest of this year. _ For the first six months of 1996 , the cumulative goods and services deficit was down 14 percent to $52.62 billion from $61.34 billion in the first half of 1995. Imports of autos and parts from all sources dropped sharply , by $689 million to $10.79 billion in June. Computer imports were down $413 million to $4.24 billion and semiconductor imports decreased $291 million to $2.87 billion in June. In bilateral trade , the deficit with Western Europe fell 7.1 percent to $761 million and the shortfall with Canada was down 2.2 percent to $2.42 billion. The deficit with oil-producing OPEC countries dropped 26.9 percent in June to $1.40 billion from $1.91 billion in May.
