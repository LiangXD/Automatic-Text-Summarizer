London's Globe , an experiment in theatre history. London's Globe , an experiment in theatre history. Helen Smith LONDON 1996-08-20 In a theatre open to London's often rainy skies , a troupe of actors begins a risky experiment on Wednesday to discover what William Shakespeare's plays were like when first peformed 400 years ago. His vision is still central to the 30 million pound ( $46 million ) Globe , which begins a _ prologue season _ on Wednesday with a production of _ Two Gentlemen of Verona. _ _ Anyone who worked with Sam was very much influenced by what he wanted to put together , _ said Lennie James , who plays one of the _ Two Gentlemen. _ Interviewed under grey skies in the Globe's auditorium on Tuesday , James said the place feels permeated with a sense of history. _ When ( artistic director Mark Rylance ) first welcomed us onto the stage saying we were the first actors in 400 years to stand here , I got a real buzz , _ he said. But little is still known about the theatres of the day. The cast of _ Two Gentlemen of Verona _ will include women and black actors , both unheard of in Shakespeare's day , and the play is set in modern Italy.
