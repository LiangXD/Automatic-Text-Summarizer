Zimbabwe's president is sworn in SubHead: Lawmakers boycott event Author: BY JON JETER HARARE, Zimbabwe - President Robert Mugabe was sworn in Sunday for his fifth term in office following a bitterly fought election that the opposition and many Western governments denounced as rigged. Speaking publicly for the first time since government election officials declared him the winner four days ago, Mugabe returned to the themes he struck during his campaign against Morgan Tsvangirai, a former trade union leader. Mugabe is a former rebel leader who led this country to independence from Britain 22 years ago. South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo are pressing Mugabe to accept such an arrangement to avoid deepening international sanctions and suspension from the Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies. Investors and Western diplomats have said they might interpret Mbeki's support for Mugabe or the elections as a sign that Africa is not intent on revitalizing its economies through good government and expanded international trade.
