Italian returns from Russian space mission Text of report in English by Italian news agency ANSA web site Moscow, 5 May: Italian astronaut Roberto Vittori, a Russian cosmonaut and a paying space tourist, returned to earth today from their ten-day mission, including eight days aboard the International Space Station (ISS). I'm ready to go back, Vittori told Italian general Mario Arpino during a telephone call shortly after the Russian Soyuz space capsule made its touch-down in Kazakhstan. Russian officials said the three men, including the world's second space tourist South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, were in fine condition. Shuttleworth, 28, who paid the Russians 20m dollars for his jaunt in space, termed the experience extraordinary.
