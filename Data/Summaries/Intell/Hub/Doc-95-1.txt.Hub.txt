USA : Wall St stocks slide for second straight session. Wall St stocks slide for second straight session. Richard Melville NEW YORK 1997-03-31 Heightened concern about the outlook for interest rates sent Wall Street stocks skidding for a second straight session on Monday and dragged the Dow industrials to one of their sharpest losses ever. The Dow industrials tumbled 157 points to 6583. The declines by technology issues , coupled with weak showing by health-care stocks , pulled Nasdaq down 28 points to 1222. Analysts said some of the activity bore the earmarks of portfolio window-dressing by managers leery of showing large stock holdings in the uncertain climate. _ Today was the last day of the quarter , and it looked like we got some reverse window-dressing , _ said Peter Canelo , chief investment strategist at Dean Witter. _ All of a sudden nobody wants to show they own any stocks , _ he said. Analysts said brokerages were particularly hard hit among financials , another symptom of ailing market sentiment. _ The brokerage index is extremely sensitive to market climates , _ said Joseph Barthel , chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co. He added that traditionally , brokerage stocks peak about six months before the onset of a bear market , but warned that trying to time such a peak is an act of futility. _ You never know when the peak was until you look back , _ he said. XBD fell 26 points , or 4.6 percent , to 490.31.
