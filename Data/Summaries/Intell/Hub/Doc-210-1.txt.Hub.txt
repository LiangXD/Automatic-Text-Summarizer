On March 4, the US State Depart-ment released its annual human rights report. Apart from criticizing the axis of evil countries for abusing human rights, it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti-terrorist alliance. 11 restrictions in the US on entering and leaving the country and on air travel, as well as measures curbing the civil rights of accused persons, are not discussed at all. Consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overshadowing concerns about human rights. US activities, meanwhile, show no sign of promoting the universal values of democracy, human rights and peace. The human rights report poses a substantial challenge to the US interpretation of good and evil. The report expressly points out that, It is extremely easy for terrorists to find supporters in countries where human rights are not respected and where individual freedom is repressed. To prove that human rights are important ammunition in the battle against terror, then, the US must attack terrorism to make human rights matter to these countries. If, however, US President George W. Bush still believes in the supremacy of human rights, he must not forget the breeding ground for terrorists that exists within the anti-terrorist alliance. Such wishful thinking risks making the US an accomplice in the destruction of human rights.
