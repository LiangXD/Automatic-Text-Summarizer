San Francisco 49ers quarterback Alex Smith joins search for missing California girl Sierra LaMar San Francisco 49ers quarterback Alex Smith has reportedly joined the search for a missing California girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago on her way to school. Smith was among 581 volunteers who turned out Saturday to search for 15-year-old Sierra LaMar, of Morgan Hill, Calif., who was last seen March 16, the Contra Costa Times reported. Santa Clara sheriff deputies confirmed that a volunteer searching for LaMar discovered the items near a dead-end road about 2 miles from the girl's home, Fox affiliate KTVU-TV reported. Investigators said last week that they think LaMar, a sophomore at Sobrato High School, likely was the victim of an acquaintance abduction. Police dogs searching for the girl lost her scent on the driveway of her home. LaMar's phone was recovered shortly after her disappearance about three-quarters of a mile from her home after police tracked its electronic ping. Police said the last text LaMar sent out was shortly before 7 a.m. the day she disappeared, and it was not a distress text. The girl's bag also was discovered a couple of miles from her home. Police said they have interviewed registered sex offenders in the area near where LaMar was last seen. The girl's father, Steve LaMar, who lives some 40 miles away in Fremont, is a registered sex crimes offender but is not considered a suspect in the case.
