Flores maintained that this is a position that is not unique to El Salvador; it is the position of all the European countries, it is the position of the United States; this is in our view totally reasonable when so little information is available. The Salvadorian president considered that the vote of confidence in the provisional government of Carmona will not have any repercussions in relations between El Salvador and Venezuela, which he described as totally normal, we are not worried in that sense. There is no international problem, but rather a manipulation of the subject domestically; and once again I want to ask the FMLN that it does not cause damage to this country. And that in trying to hurt me, it ends up causing damage to the country. It is necessary to be loyal to El Salvador, Flores concluded.
