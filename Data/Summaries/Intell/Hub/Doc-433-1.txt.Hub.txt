Pat LaCrosse asked me to send this information inviting you to join the Georgia O'Keeffe Circle of the Indianapolis Museum of Art's Second Century Society (SCS). The SCS brochure I am enclosing will give you the historic significance of SCS, as well as listing activities and specific benefits awarded to donors at the Georgia O'Keeffe level. Your Georgia O'Keeffe membership, please note, includes free admission to all art-related activities of the IMA's Young Friends of Art group. Sincerely, ARLETTA B.NEWTON Donor Relations Coordinator Enclosures/ P.S. Both our Barefoot in the Grass family picnic (July 23,2000) and the annual SCS Founders Day celebration (October 11,2000) are free for Georgia O'Keeffe members.
