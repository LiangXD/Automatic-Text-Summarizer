Critics say that on the one hand Australia is saying it does not want to dump Kyoto, yet on the other it is cosying up to the US - which does want to dump Kyoto. The Opposition's environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, said yesterday that Australia should not follow the US position on climate change. Asked if the disagreement was also with Australia, Mr Blair said: Yes. He was not sure the Kyoto Protocol actually went far enough.
