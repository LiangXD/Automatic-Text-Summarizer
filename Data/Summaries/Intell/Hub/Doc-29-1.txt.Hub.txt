Seeking an ethical watchdog for the genetic scientists By TOM WILKIE IN A RARE display of consensus last week , industry , consumers _' organisations and the environmental movement called for a national committee to examine the social and ethical implications of biotechnology and genetic engineering of plants and animals , Tom Wilkie writes. Ms Foster put forward the idea of a similar investigation for plant and animal biotechnology because she was troubled by the unnecessary secrecy and seeming insensitivity of government departments to issues other than the narrow technical one of safety. The suggestion was supported both by companies involved in biotechnology and by environmental groups. The NCC meeting provided an unprecedented forum for all sides ? representatives of consumer interests , environmental groups such as the Green Alliance , and commercial firms such as ICI ? to come together to discuss the implications of the new biotechnology. But he opposed any suggestion that representatives of the environmental movement might sit on the technical committees set up_to decide on the safety of any release of genetically manipulated organisms into the environment. ICI is in the vanguard of genetic engineering.
