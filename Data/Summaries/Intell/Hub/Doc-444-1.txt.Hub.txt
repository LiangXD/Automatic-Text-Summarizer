July 25,1997 Dear Name, What a Summer! I hope you'll consider continuing your support of Jameson's special campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx. All of our Six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity (and, truth be told, with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed in) and we have a waiting list of 60 children who are hoping to come if a spot should open. Even after the summer sessions come to a close, Jameson campers will take part in year-round programs designed to keep that positive contact with peers and role models alive and important. We've scheduled more than 15 follow-up camper weekends beginning in September and going around till next summers camping season.
