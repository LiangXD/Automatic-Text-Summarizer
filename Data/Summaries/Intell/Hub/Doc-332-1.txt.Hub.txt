Peronist to head Argentina at least till March elections BUENOS AIRES - Veteran Peronist Adolfo Rodriguez Saa was set to become the country's interim president yesterday, taking power after a devastating economic crisis toppled President Fernando de la Rua. Taking on a job many in his own Peronist party spurned, Rodriguez Saa is expected to serve as president at least until new elections, tentatively scheduled for March 3. The leader elected then will finish out the two years of de la Rua's term. Polls indicate that a majority of Argentines support keeping the peg in place, despite increased calls from many economists and several political leaders that only a devaluation can help the economy rebound. Argentines wary of surging unemployment, rising poverty, salary cuts and tax hikes are deeply skeptical of more calls for belt-tightening, the centerpiece of policies advocated by De la Rua and his economy minister Domingo Cavallo. That was the message the people sent to De la Rua and all the other political leaders. Rodriguez Saa is reportedly considering easing banking restrictions imposed by De la Rua, limiting to $1,000 the amount of money Argentines can withdraw from their accounts.
