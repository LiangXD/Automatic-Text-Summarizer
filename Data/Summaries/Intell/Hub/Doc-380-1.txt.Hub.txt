DESK TEHRAN -- President Robert Mugabe easily won Zimbabwe's election on Wednesday despite biased propaganda unleashed against him by some Western countries, accusing him of being unfair towards the opposition. Australia said it feared violence if voters thought the election had been stolen. Western countries queued up to condemn the election in which the 78-year-old president faced his first real challenge. Australia and Britain led an unsuccessful call for commonwealth sanctions against Mugabe before the election.
