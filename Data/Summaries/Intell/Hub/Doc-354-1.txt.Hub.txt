And now coup-plotting military officers and the reinstalled president, Hugo Chavez, need to show Latin America that their tyrannical tactics are at an end. He has sometimes talked of remaining president past the year 2020. But Latin America has moved beyond coups, and this pivotal nation in a hemisphere of democracies has the means to remove Mr. Chavez by constitutional and especially nonviolent means.

But then international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez forced the generals to let him take office again.
