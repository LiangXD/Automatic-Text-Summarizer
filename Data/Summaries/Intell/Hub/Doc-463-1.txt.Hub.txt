SHUTTLEWORTH-MBEKI by Mariette le Roux BLOEMFONTEIN April 27 Sapa MBEKI SPEAKS TO 'AFRONAUT' IN OUTER SPACE Contact was made on Saturday between outer space and the Free State city of Bloemfontein when President Thabo Mbeki spoke to Africa's first astronaut Mark Shuttleworth, aboard the International Space Station. Shuttleworth described his journey so far as very exciting, saying the flight had been smooth and everything was going according to plan. I am sure the American food will be just as good, Shuttleworth told the president. Shuttleworth agreed that this was essential towards Africa's rebirth. South Africans should be looking up smiling when he returns, Shuttleworth replied. The president then toasted Shuttleworth with a glass of champagne, saying: I am sure this will go down in our history as one of those moments where we made quite a leap forward. The world's second space tourist, Shuttleworth was paying 20 million dollars for his 10-day journey into space, where he would carry out experiments into the HI virus which causes AIDS.
