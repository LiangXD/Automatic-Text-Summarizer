Fashioning Paula USA Today leads with Texas' settlement of its product-liability lawsuit against the leading tobacco companies. The New York Times leads with a comprehensive poll about American attitudes concerning abortion. In the Texas case, reports USAT , the defendant companies have agreed to pay about $15 billion over 25 years to reimburse the state for expenses it incurred in the treatment of smoking-related illnesses. That makes Texas the third state to settle such a case, joining Florida and Mississippi. The Wall Street Journal states that the plaintiffs' lawyers hired by Texas to try the case will receive as part of the deal almost $2.2 billion in fees. The NYT abortion survey, the first conducted by the paper since 1989, was based on telephone interviews of 1,101 people and detects a notable shift from general acceptance of having the procedure: from 40 percent to 32 percent. And the pollsters also detected an increasingly acute sensitivity to abortion timing: Sixty-one percent of those polled thought abortions should be permitted during the first trimester, but only 15 percent in the second and just 7 percent in the third. (The piece notes that this last stat helps explain why a focus on partial-birth abortions has proven politically advantageous for abortion foes.) Nearly 45 percent of those asked to state the present law on abortion could not give the correct answer. Some local cable companies, the paper says, expect the fees they'll pay ESPN to go up more than 20 percent. Even nonsports fans will be affected, notes the Journal , because ESPN is usually part of basic cable service.
