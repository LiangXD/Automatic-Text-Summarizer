The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez Washington Times April 25, 2002 Pg. 18 The Fall And Rise Of Hugo Chavez In Venezuela, the dust is finally settling after the dramatic turbulence of the past two weeks. President Hugo Chavez is once again at the helm of power, and the military has returned to its barracks. Mr. Chavez was ousted in a military coup on April 12 after 17 persons were killed during an anti-Chavez protest, apparently by sharpshooters faithful to the president.
