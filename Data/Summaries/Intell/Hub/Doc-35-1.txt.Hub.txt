Dice rolling with the times. THE centuries-old five-dice game of liardice ? or liar '_ s dice as it is called in North America ? has a modern problem. Mr Hughes believes it is the only such electronic game aimed at an adult market and the only one not designed and manufactured in the Far East. It could prove to be a good roll of the dice , for Mr Hughes has also written a book on the mathematics of five-dice games and devised special packaging to exploit the game '_ s addictiveness by allowing it to be played while it is hanging from the supermarket shelf.
