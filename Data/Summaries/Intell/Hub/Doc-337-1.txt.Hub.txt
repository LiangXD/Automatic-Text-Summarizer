Commander of base sees a world of change GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba -- What a difference a terrorist detention center makes. Between the armored vehicles ferrying Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners to Camp X-Ray and the international observers whizzing past, it may be time to dust off the only traffic signal that ever operated on the 45-square-mile base, says Navy Capt. Now he's still head honcho of the base itself. "Now in two weeks we've had 1,200 people drop in on us. And I can't speak for everybody on the base but I think most people are glad to be part of it, excited by it." He arrived here in 2000, and is now presiding over a transformation of this suburban-style base that, until its latest assignment, was a backwater of 2,400 people -- 700 of them Navy and Marine members, the rest Jamaican and Filipino contract workers plus family members. So much so, he said, that not a single family member or contractor has so far requested to leave here, the oldest U.S. base overseas, and the only one left in a communist country. Nor is there any worry over the infrastructure, which was stretched to the limit in 1994 and 1995 when the base became an encampment 55,000-plus Haitian and Cuban boat people -- and the commander sent civilians stateside to make room for the 8,000 U.S. personnel who came to tend to the migrant project. In fact, tensions got so hot in 1962 that the base slipped Navy wives and kids onto a cargo ship and evacuated them during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Fourteen months later, Castro cut off utilities to the base, compelling the U.S. Navy to install electricity and desalination plants. But Buehn said the Cubans have not raised any formal objections to the base's latest mission. Geographically the base is split by the bay, and united by a ferry service. Meanwhile, Buehn is wondering what the latest mission will do to Gitmo's image. "As base commander, I've given a lot of thought about what the name Guantanamo Bay may conjure up in someone's mind.
