USA : Consumer Reports finds sport/utilities unsafe. Consumer Reports finds sport/utilities unsafe. Mark Wallace NEW YORK 1996-08-20 Consumer Reports magazine slapped a _ Not Acceptable _ label on two sport/utility vehicles Tuesday , saying the light trucks _ have too great a tendency to roll over in certain situations. _ The magazine said the 1995 and 1996 models of the Isuzu Trooper , made by Isuzu Motors Ltd. , and the 1996 Acura SLX , also made by Isuzu but sold by Honda Motor Co. Ltd. , were a danger to consumers because they _ tipped up high on two wheels _ in road tests. The magazine said consumers should stop buying the models , called for an immediate recall of the approximately 35,000 cars that have been sold and said repairs or replacement models should be offered by the manufacturer. _ We do_ n't think a vehicle that has these characteristics should do what it did when subjected to this not inconceivable situation , _ said Bob Knoll , director of testing for Consumer Reports' auto division , in a telephone interview A spokesman for Isuzu defended the vehicles. _ It_ 's very important for both consumers in general and Isuzu Trooper owners to understand very clearly that the Isuzu Trooper meets all federal safety standards and regulations , _ Isuzu spokesman Daniel McCue told Reuters.
