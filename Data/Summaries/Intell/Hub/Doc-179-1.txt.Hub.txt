HONG KONG, Nov 21 (AFP) -- The number of south Asians seeking political asylum in Hong Kong is on the rise following the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, it was reported Wednesday. A spokesman for the security bureau said Hong Kong would not grant anyone political asylum under present policies. Hong Kong closed its last refugee camp, for Vietnamese migrants, last year after the 1,400 remaining boat people were allowed to remain.
