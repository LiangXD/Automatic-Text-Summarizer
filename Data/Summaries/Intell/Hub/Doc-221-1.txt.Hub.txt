Kawamura: Japan and Taiwan are both exporting nations. Half of this one third was transported to Japan through the sea areas near Taiwan. The traffic on Taiwan's seas is extremely important to Japan. If Taiwan becomes a part of China, all of Taiwan's sea areas will be threatened. Question: What is your appraisal of Taiwan's navy? Kawamura: Frankly speaking, Taiwan's navy is worrisome. Although Japan and the United States haven't recognized it, in reality, the United States, Japan and Taiwan currently are already situated in a kind of virtual alliance. I reckon that at the last stage, the United States will provide the Aegis destroyer to Taiwan. It is not possible that the Republican Party will get along with China, Taiwan can again wait for a little while. The most likely method is to use missiles to threaten Taiwan psychologically. Question: How should Taiwan respond to China's missile threat? Sato: I gave a speech on this issue in Taiwan. Taiwan has some people who very obviously purposely play up China's use of force to scare Taiwan. Before the United States attacked Afghanistan, it first explained the reasons to every nation of the world, and China using missiles to attack Taiwan is certainly not simple. Question: What is the significance for Taiwan of the United States and Japan jointly researching TMD theater missile defense system technology? Taiwan is also very important to the United States, especially Taiwan's strategic position. Currently, Taiwan's Patriot missiles are effective against guided missiles. I reckon that the probability of war occurring between China and Taiwan is smaller than small.
