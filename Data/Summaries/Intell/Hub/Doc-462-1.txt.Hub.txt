INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC Talks between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) about a free trade area went smoothly, senior officials said yesterday. The third China-ASEAN Economic Senior Official's meeting, held in Beijing on Tuesday, set up a trade negotiation committee to hold in-depth discussions on the framework of a free trade area in the region. Premier Zhu Rongji and ASEAN leaders agreed at the fifth China-ASEAN leaders' summit in November to set up a free trade area within 10 years. Chinese and ASEAN officials said the decision by Chinese and ASEAN leaders to establish a free trade area is a historic milestone in economic co-operation between China and ASEAN and demonstrates strong commitments by China-ASEAN leaders to regional integration and economic globalization as they pursue peace and stability and prosperity in the region.
