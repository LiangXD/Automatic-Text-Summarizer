Australian govt pushes budget , despite protests. Bradley Perrett CANBERRA 1996-08-21 Australia's new conservative government on Wednesday began selling its tough deficit-slashing budget , which sparked violent protests by Aborigines , unions , students and welfare groups even before it was announced. Two days of anti-budget street protests preceded spending cuts officially unveiled by Treasurer Peter Costello. _ This is a once-in-a-decade chance to get it right , _ Costello said in a radio interview. _ If we do_ n't do it now , Australia is going to be in deficit and debt into the next century. _ Tuesday's budget sliced A$4 billion ( US$3.1 billion ) from the budget for the current fiscal year , to June 1997 , as a first instalment towards an underlying surplus ( excluding asset sales ) by 1998/99. As the protesters had feared , Costello revealed a cut to the government's Aboriginal welfare commission among the hundreds of measures implemented to claw back the deficit. Financial markets were mildly disappointed that the budget failed to be as tough as they expected. The cuts , many of which had been disclosed ahead_of the budget , have sparked protests around the country and triggered rioting during a protest by unionists , students , Aborigines and welfare groups at Parliament House on Monday.
