The plan is to move them to Guantanamo Bay, the US official said, without specifying when. Washington insisted it would not have acted without credible evidence, but the transfer exposed it to more criticism from campaigners who have accused it of disregarding human rights in its declared war on terror. A Bosnian government official said legal procedures had been respected in the case, but a senior UN human rights officer in Bosnia said they had been trampled over. Not only had a court ordered their release on Thursday but the state's top human rights body had instructed authorities to prevent four being taken out of the country by force. It's very disappointing, Madeleine Rees, head of the Bosnia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said of the operation. Washington is already under fire from human rights groups for its treatment of prisoners captured in Afghanistan and held at Guantanamo Bay. A Bosnian government official insisted the appeal had already been rejected and legal procedures had been followed. He said the government had not been aware of the ruling by Bosnia's Human Rights Chamber that measures should be taken to stop four of the suspects being taken out of the country. The legal procedure in this case has been fully respected so far, said Jusif Halilagic, a deputy minister who represents the government in the chamber.
