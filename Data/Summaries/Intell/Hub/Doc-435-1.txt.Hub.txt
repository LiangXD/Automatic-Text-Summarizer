Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring, responsible adult volunteers with at-risk girls, ages 8-14. A Big Sister is a mentor, a friend and a role model, helping a young girl to develop the self-confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible, productive and successful adult. This is positive proof that Big Sisters one-to-one mentoring program helps change lives. Today Big Sisters serves over 1,000 girls in central Indiana. Over 235 girls are currently waiting for a Big Sister. Imagine the difference the community could make if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match!
