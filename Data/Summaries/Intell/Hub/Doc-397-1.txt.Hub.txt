Britain's Prescott Pushes for Kyoto Pact Backing VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- The Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be ratified even without U.S. support, British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told an international conference on business and the environment on Friday. The Kyoto Protocol calls on countries to reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are blamed by many scientists for global warming, to pre-1990 levels by 2012. Forty-nine countries had done so as of mid-March, according to the United Nations. Europe's environment ministers have agreed that all 15 EU nations should adhere to the Kyoto Protocol. Prescott said the British program aims to cut emissions by 20 percent, and the country is now half way to that goal. Canada is among the countries that have pledged to ratify the accord.
