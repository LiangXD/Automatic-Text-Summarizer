The criteria set by Rice are the following: the three countries in question are repressive and grave human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction. One can name more than a dozen countries which are contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one speed or another. Come to think of it, acquiring weapons of mass destruction per se may not be a correct basis for judging whether a nation is good or evil. After all, the US is the first nation to have developed nuclear weapons. This is, in fact, the fear of all countries, as they feel that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction. If this is the case, Rice could have elaborated more precise criteria for membership in the axis of evil, by establishing more clearly the connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
