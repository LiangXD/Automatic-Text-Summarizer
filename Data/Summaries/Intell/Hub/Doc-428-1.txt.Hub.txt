That's almost enough for Chatterbox to jump on the Hillary for Senate bandwagon. The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clinton's marital problems a major campaign issue. Giuliani's estrangement from his wife, Donna Hanover, is made clear in an interview with Hanover that appears in today's New York Times. Hanover would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate, whether she would like him to run for Senate, or whether she would campaign for him if he did. And, for a punch line: Ms. Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said this week that Ms. Hanover had no comment on Mrs. Clinton's potential Senate campaign. Does she have any comment on whether Ms. Hanover plans to be Hillary Clinton's campaign manager?
