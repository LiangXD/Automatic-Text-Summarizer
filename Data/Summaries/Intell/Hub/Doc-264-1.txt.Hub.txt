The oat-bran craze has cost the world's largest cereal maker market share. Kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%. Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg. Each share point is worth about $60 million in sales. I don't think Kellogg can get back to 40% this year, he said. Mr. Maxwell said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills' share increased to 30% or more. In announcing the plant delay, Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe said, Cereal volume growth in the U.S. has not met our expectations for 1989. General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity. Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume. Although he called current market conditions highly competitive, Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year. Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion. Net fell 16% to $123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share. Sales rose 4.8% to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.
