The report expressly points out that, "It is extremely easy for terrorists to find supporters in countries where human rights are not respected and where individual freedom is repressed."Apart from criticizing the "axis of evil" countries for abusing human rights, it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti-terrorist alliance.Consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overshadowing concerns about human rights.To prove that human rights are important ammunition in the battle against terror, then, the US must attack terrorism to make human rights matter to these countries.If the US, which claims to be the world's policeman, is incapable of looking beyond US interests or of practicing the universal values of human rights, democracy and peace, then shouldn't the international community reconsider the role played by the UN, or learn from the way the European parliament works?Since Israel suffers from terrorist attacks, the report says, it has been forced to take counter-terrorism measures, making its rights abuses understandable.Put simply, what we are seeing is the naked pursuit of US interests.The US is planning to extend military aid to several countries in the alliance to enable them to root out terrorists without using US forces.
