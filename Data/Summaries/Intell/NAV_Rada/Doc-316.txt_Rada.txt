Military officers said Chavez had ordered National Guard troops and civilian gunmen, including rooftop snipers, to stop the marchers from reaching the palace.With Chavez's ouster, jubilant executives at Venezuela's state oil monopoly, who had been engaged in a work slowdown, promised to bring production and exports up to speed as quickly as possible."I urge Venezuelans to maintain calm, to keep faith, to continue working on the road toward democracy, freedom and peace," said retired Gen. Guaicaipuro Lameda, who until February headed the oil company and was a leader of the movement to oust Chavez.The strike was in support of the protesting executives at the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela.After Thursday's violence, the high command decided Chavez had to go, and they confronted him en masse in his offices, Anselmi said.Chavez was being held at the army base while investigators decide what charges he could face, said army commander Gen. Efrain Vasquez Velasco.Venezuelan military forces President Hugo Chavez to resign after a day of bloodshed Author: JORGE RUEDA CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - President Hugo Chavez, whose social and economic policies polarized Venezuela and whose friendship with Cuba irritated the United States, resigned under military pressure Friday after a massive opposition demonstration ended in a bloodbath.The armed forces - which have traditionally strong ties to the U.S. military - resented Chavez's distancing of Venezuela from Washington, including a decision to suspend Venezuela's participation in regional military exercises.Oil generates 80 per cent of Venezuela's foreign earnings.Chavez had irritated Washington with his close ties to Cuban President Fidel Castro, visits to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and to Libya, and criticism of U.S. bombings in Afghanistan.The circles were created after Castro urged Chavez's supporters to organize during a 2000 visit.He quit just hours after at least 13 people were killed and a reported 110 wounded during a demonstration by an estimated 150,000 opposition supporters in downtown Caracas.Chavez also exasperated Venezuelans with his frequent use of "cadenas" - hours-long presidential speeches that by law had to be broadcast by all Venezuelan TV and radio stations.And he had alienated many sectors of Venezuelan society, with his attacks on the news media and Roman Catholic Church leaders, his refusal to consult with business leaders, and his failed attempt to assert government control over labour groups.The Bush administration said it was closely monitoring the political upheaval in Venezuela.
