In the battle against the new forms of terrorism that reached a tragic culmination on 11 September, a limited form of military violence could also not be ruled out.But to build this strategy, targeted attacks on the infrastructure available to Bin Ladin were necessary.That is a clear condition for this first, unavoidable phase in the battle against terrorism to be humanly acceptable.Without armed violence the Nazi regime and similar forces that had the wind in their sails in Europe in the 1930s, would not have fallen.The many and often confusing reports we have received over recent weeks on who may be responsible for the attacks already allows a clear pattern to be detected.
