Since the United States switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, ROC Representative to the United States Chen Chien-jen said substantive Taiwan-U.S. relations have never been as close as they are at the present time.Noting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chen said Taiwan and mainland China will be able to engage in constructive interactions under the WTO framework.Moreover, Chen said, Taiwan can from now on conduct trade and economic exchanges with all other WTO members under the principles of equality, fairness and reciprocity.In his view, Chen said, the ever firmer U.S. support for Taiwan partly stems from its recognition of the island's remarkable progress in democratization and liberalization.
