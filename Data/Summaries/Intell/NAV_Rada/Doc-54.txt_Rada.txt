A 200-metre belt of trees has been planted on each side of the Yongding, Chaobai, Dasha and Wenyu rivers, which was previously the city's most desertificated land.By 2005, 50 per cent of Beijing's land, including both urban and rural areas, will have been covered with trees.The shifting dunes in Beijing's suburbs and rural areas have been successfully controlled by green barriers of trees and grass, which have also helped upgrade the city's forest proportion to 43 per cent, 23 percentage points higher than the nation's metropolitan average.Private organizations are also being encouraged to help fight sandstorms, according to the administration's vice-director Li Yucai.
