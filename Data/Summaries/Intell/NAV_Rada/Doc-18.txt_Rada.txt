PONTE VEDRA BEACH , Florida 1997-03-30 Steve Elkington birdied the first four holes on the first day and never looked back , beating the best field in PGA history to win the Players Championship by a record seven strokes Sunday .Leading this tournament wire to wire was the most difficult thing I_ 've done in golf , _" Elkington said .Woods , playing in his first Players Championship , also was 71 or worse in each round and finished at 1-over 289 ."_ I basically blew away the best field we_ 've ever had , and it_ 's something I did_ n't know I was capable of .Elkington squandered half of a four-shot lead when he bogeyed the final two holes Saturday ."_ Steve's a ( Nick ) Faldo-like player in that he can keep it in play and make pars when he has to and never give up the lead , _" Faxon said .Elkington , who won here in 1991 , shot a 3-under-par 69 $-- his fourth straight round in the 60s $-- and finished at 16-under 272 , seven shots in front of Scott Hoch .Love would have finished tied for seventh had he not signed an incorrect scorecard caused by a mistake at the 17th hole .I had an opportunity today , but Steve shut that down for me , _" said Hoch .Thinking ahead to the Masters in two weeks , Elkington said : "_ The confidence I_ 've got now should help me immensely , but at Augusta I either finish top five or I miss the cut .Billy Andrade struggled to a 74 and was fifth at 282 , just in front of 1996 Player of the Year Tom Lehman , who had a 72 .The final birdie came on the 18th hole when Elkington chipped in from 30 feet .Hoch , the 1989 Masters runner-up who has won once in each of the last three years , got off to an awful start and never recovered .He was not a factor , and neither were big names such as Greg Norman , Nick Faldo and 21-year-old sensation Tiger Woods , who has now gone 13 straight weeks without a win .His birdie at the par-3 eighth hole extended his lead to six shots .
