Although the islands saw little action, as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power.The Persian Wars As Athens rose in influence and power in the West, it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire.While Byzantine land was being divided, there was no one in control of the seas, so pirates raided towns on many of the islands.Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors, who were led by Philip II of Macedon.Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands, the next major power change brought influence from the West.The Aegean Islands, which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes, became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse.Homer wrote his epic works on Chios; and lyrical poetry was much admired, particularly the work of the poets Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos.Later, in 454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age.In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval, the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans (at around 1300 b.c. ), who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland.In 1566, they wrested Chios from the Genoese, bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands, but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or more -- Tinos was the last to fall in 1715.The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified cities, but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders.By the time of the Crusades, many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated.An important early material, obsidian, was discovered on the island of Milos.The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism, and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp, cool summers.Finally, Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor, which became part of the new Turkish state.The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean Islands, which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade.Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories.After the war, in 1949, the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation.Greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of Asia Minor, which for over 2,000 years had had a substantial Greek population.Santorini (Thira), the next major island north, was heavily influenced by Crete, and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time.The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state.The preeminent islands of this era were Delos, a sacred island and center of religion ruled by Athens; Samos, ruled by the tyrant Polycrates; and Naxos, whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major building projects.330, however, when the newly converted Emperor Constantine made Byzantium, renamed Constantinople, capital of his Eastern Empire that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek life.Several islands and Greek city-states agreed to work together, and created a treasury to fund their plans, which was held on the island of Delos.In 1770, Russia came to aid the Greeks (defined by their Orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries), declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774.The Ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled, forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean.
