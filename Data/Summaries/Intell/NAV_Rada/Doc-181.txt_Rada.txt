Let's say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a "B" DNA type appears in a DNA section is odd or even.The DNA section -- the "input" -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer's "hardware".The "computers" are biological molecules, using DNA for software and enzymes for hardware, and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second.The computer can also do other calculations, such as checking whether the "B" sequence appears at least once, or at most once, by inserting different types of software DNAs.If the tip of the input is "B", the input will be labeled as having an odd number of "B" sequences.Once the computer has dissected the entire input, it can determine whether the sequence appeared an even or odd number of times according to the last label -- the "output".Professor Shapiro and a growing number of other scientists believe DNA-based computers may lead to a number of useful applications -- they could be planted inside cells, where they would watch for irregularities or even synthesize drugs.Some scientists believe DNA-based computers could have an advantage over existing computers based on silicon chips.
