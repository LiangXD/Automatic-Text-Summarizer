Huang claimed the previous day in Taichung that he had been trapped by the gangsters, who had pretended to be his political supporters.Chang Fu-shun, 27, is said to be the younger brother of Chang Hui-hua, who allegedly invited Huang to meet her at the hotel and who Huang claimed was in the hotel room when he was detained.The police said that the hotel room had been paid for by a woman who checked in under the name of Lin An, which they said was an alias used by Chang Hui-hua.Huang revealed what he claimed to be the whole story at a news conference Wednesday night after press reports said he had in fact been caught with prostitutes in the hotel and blackmailed.
