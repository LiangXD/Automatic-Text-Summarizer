A report about settlement activity in Palestinian territories has confirmed that 36 new settlement sites--settlement enclaves--have been created since Sharon became Prime Minister of Israel less than a year ago.The annual report published by the National Bureau for Defending Land and Resisting Colonization in cooperation with the International Solidarity Establishment for Human Rights said that the nuclei of 36 new settlements were established from March 2001 to the end of November 2001 in various parts of the West Bank.He said: "There are two grave violations, the first concerns settlement building and the transfer of settlers to the Palestinian territories on which tens of settlements have been built.The report also noted that work on bypass roads continued at a rate faster than that of the government of Barak who gave free rein to settlement activities.He explained that Palestinian population centers were used as human shields for the protection of settlements, and that about 90 percent of the bombardments to which Palestinian population centers were subjected originated in settlements.In the Gaza Strip 1,051 donums were annexed to existing settlements, 32 new housing units were built, and work on 190 additional units was started.He noted that during the current intifadah settlers uprooted more than 6,580 fruit trees, destroyed more than 4,099 cultivated donums, while 85 houses, 90 commercial premises, more than 100 cars, and 17 ambulances were damaged as a result of attacks carried out by settlers.He said: "At a time when Israel's economic growth rate declined to 1.5 percent and the budgets of the Ministry of Labor and Welfare and other ministries were cut, Sharon's government maintained its support for settlements and increased it to compensate for the growing exodus from settlements."In addition, 102 mobile caravans were added to settlements and new settlement sites and more than 705 donums were added to existing settlements.The second is Israel's enacting of laws that facilitate expropriating Palestinian land and settlement activity, a matter that is considered among the war crimes."Also the report, whose findings were announced at a press conference yesterday, noted that three military positions were turned into civilian settlements and work had started on a new settlement called Giv'at Sal'it in the southern valleys region.
