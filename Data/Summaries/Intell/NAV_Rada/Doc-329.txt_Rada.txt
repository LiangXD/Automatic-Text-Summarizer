Let me pause only briefly to allow that America is imperfect, like all earthly things; that its governments and people have committed many sins; that might does not make right; that power and wealth are not good in themselves; that goodness, truth and beauty may be found in every country and town.Again and again, I have discovered it is a simple prejudice, rather than a product of comprehensive reasoning: for the charges brought against those "damn Yankees" shift loosely between the U.S. polity and people, and are no sooner effectively rebutted than more charges come forward in their place.We are told it is wrong to hate our enemies.And while the conventional and verbal anti-Americanism is in a different league from the terrorist strikes -- closer to hypocrisy than to murderous hatred -- I think the two are animated by a common cause: a cause to be sought in the murk of the individual human soul, not in the externals of political argument.("Yes, that was horrible ... but we have to realize why the Americans are so hated.")To be fair, so far as truth can be discerned from polls, the free Western world is indeed grateful, and on balance quite supportive of the cause the Americans are leading.From British lords down to humble skinheads, sneering at the American "vulgarity" confers a comforting sense of personal and national vindication, when no other prop can be found.In the column I wrote on the very day of the September catastrophe, I touched upon the envy of America, which I believed to be its "root cause."The world's most prominent self-styled "Palestinian refugee," Edward Said, is the perfect example of this: a man who would be nothing without the chic and prestige conferred by elite U.S. universities and the publishing institutions of New York, N.Y.Potential terrorists may well be concealed among them, but for the great majority, it is common knowledge that the United States is a land of freedom and opportunity -- the preferred destination of the world's emigrants for the better part of the past two centuries.11. That the United States is compelled, through the unpreparedness of its allies, to conduct this fight in its military dimension almost single-handedly, should be a cause for soul-searching gratitude among those allies, hardly the resentment we have so often seen.
