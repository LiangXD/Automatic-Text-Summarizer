The conclusion to which we come is that the Zionist and US administrations have aggravated the Zionist entity's historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that "force" can break the Palestinian people's will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose.It is thus an illusion for these criminal administrations to imagine that they have triumphed and that they are now in a position to dictate their own conditions on this great people.The Zionists have succeeded in achieving these things, but a deep-rooted fact is that they have not succeeded, and will never succeed, in breaking the will of this valiant people or in forcing the Palestinians into relinquishing their just, legitimate rights and ending their glorious struggle for these rights.It is true that the Palestinian towns are now under occupation, that the Palestinian Authority's institutions have been destroyed, and that Arafat is still besieged at his office as a hostage.The Zionist and US administrations have the illusion that they succeeded in defeating the Palestinian people and their valiant intifadah.Another deep-rooted fact is that the organizations of the Palestinian resistance still preserve their organizational structure and are also characterized by their superb ability to renew their leaders and replace the ones who fall along the path of martyrdom.
