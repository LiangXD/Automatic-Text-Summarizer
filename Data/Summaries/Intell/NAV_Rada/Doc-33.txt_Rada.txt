The Action Campaign is also seeking support from medical journalists , and I have been asked repeatedly if I was going to add to the & bquo ; adverse & equo ; ME publicity .patients who are dying from cancer . & equo ; & bquo ; Go home and have more babies . & equo ; Surgery encounters like these have become increasingly common over the past 30 years with the erosion of the traditional divisions between sickness and health , which have led to , among other things , the medicalisation of & bquo ; anxiety . & equo ; .But it is not so easy if you have a condition which is not susceptible to diagnosis and has no clear-cut signs or symptoms .Doctors are now increasingly reluctant to prescribe tranquillisers for fear of being sued by patients who become addicted to them .The alleged remarks by doctors to patients quoted above were taken from an Action Campaign survey highlighting & bquo ; bad & equo ; treatment .I wish you '_ d take yourself away from me . & equo ; & bquo ; You middle class women have nothing_else to worry about . & equo ; & bquo ; It '_ s one of those things you silly young women get . & equo ; & bquo ; Stop feeling sorry for yourself .Please believe ME , I '_ m ill ME sufferers are sick of doctors not taking them seriously and have made a cinema ad to win support for their case .But this , it is claimed , may make them more vulnerable than most to negative emotions when they are shown to be powerless .It is easy enough if you have chicken pox or some other common illness with well-defined physical symptoms .WE ALL like to be taken seriously , especially when we are feeling ill .It might even help deserving patients to be taken seriously .I have patients with real illnesses ?This theory has it that , as a breed , doctors like to be masters of every possible situation , and that this may even be a factor in their selection of medicine as a career .& equo ; & bquo ; We all have to die sometimes . & equo ; & bquo ; I '_ m not prepared to do any tests .are you sure you '_ re not attention seeking ?Having heard conflicting views , I am not taking sides .Patients claiming to have Myalgic Encephalomyelitis ( ME ) may come into the latter category .
