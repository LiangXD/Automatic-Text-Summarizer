1997-03-31 Great Western Financial Corp said Monday hostile suitor H.F. Ahmanson and Co's effort to solicit shareholder consents to start negotiations has fallen "_ far short _" of a majority of the outstanding shares .The spokesman said Ahmanson stands behind its numbers that more than 80 percent of voted shares back its solicitation and that 19 of Great Western's 20 largest shareholders have voted for or indicated a vote for Ahmanson's proposals .Earlier Monday , Ahmanson said more than 80 percent of "_ voted _" Great Western shares supported its proposals .The release continued , "_ what Ahmanson has carefully avoided acknowledging is that it has fallen far short_of obtaining the necessary consents from a majority of Great Western shares by its artificial March 27 deadline . _"Based on stock prices late Monday , the Ahmanson proposal was worth $43.65 per Great Western share and the Washington Mutual proposal was worth $43.48 .The Ahmanson spokesman continued : "_ Despite Great Western's rhetoric it has been clear from the outset that this consent solicitation is about creating a level playing field for all bidders , good corporate governance and maximizing stockholder value . _"A spokesman for Ahmanson , reading a prepared statement , characterized Great Western's announcement as "_ more obfuscation . _" Comments: this provides the referent for "the spokesman" in another sentence, but is not itself relevent.Great Western has agreed to be acquired by Seattle-based Washington Mutual Inc and has rejected Ahmanson's initial offer and a subsequent revision that increased the amount of stock that would be offered to Great Western shareholders .In a press release , Great Western said "_ it is an indisputable fact that an overwhelming majority of Great Western stockholders have not consented to Ahmanson's proposed resolutions and amendments to Great Western's By-laws . _"One proposal is for adoption of a non-binding resolution urging the Great Western board to provide non-public information to Ahmanson and to enter into negotiations .
