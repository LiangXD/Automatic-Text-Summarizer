Among those who have not been questioned by the US military are three former Taleban ministers who turned themselves into the new Afghan authorities - only to be allowed to return to their homes.Harsh detention for Afghan prisoners Taleban and al-Qaeda prisoners flown from Afghanistan to an American naval base in the Caribbean are being held in tough conditions of detention.The prisoners are being housed in cells measuring 1.8 by 2.4 metres (six feet by eight feet) with open, chain-link walls, a concrete floor and wooden roof.Washington wants military tribunals to try the prisoners, and the cases are expected to be heard outside the US.They say they will be holding the detainees in cells, but really they are cages...US officials are eager to question the three, who they believe may have vital clues about the whereabouts of Mullah Omar and Osama Bin Laden.As the base is located outside sovereign territory, the prisoners have no legal rights under the US constitution, and no right of appeal to federal courts.The first group to arrive - 20 prisoners described by US military officials as "the worst elements of al-Qaeda and the Taleban" - wore goggles covered with tape and had their hands tied.A temporary detention centre called Camp X-Ray has been set up at the base in Guantanamo Bay, an isolated US outpost on the edge of Fidel Castro's Cuba.Hunt continues American officials have named al-Qaeda and Taleban leaders killed or captured as frustration grows that some senior Taleban figures are reportedly slipping through the net.Also on the wanted list are many more of Bin Laden's top lieutenants who are believed to have evaded capture.What we are operating is humane treatment, but we're not offering comfort'."Jeffrey Kofman, an American journalist who has visited the base, said the facility was "very, very minimal".The hunt continues for Bin Laden himself and Mullah Omar, who is believed to have escaped by motorbike as thousands of Afghan soldiers closed in on his suspected hideout.The most important is former Justice Minister Mullah Nuruddin Turabi - known to be close to Taleban leader Mullah Omar - former Defence Minister Mullah Ubaidullah and former Industry Minister Mullah Saadudin.
