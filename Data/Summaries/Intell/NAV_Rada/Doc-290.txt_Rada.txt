"We say they should be presumed to be POWs, and it is not up to the ICRC or to the US military authorities to decide, but up to the courts," said Michael Kleiner, an ICRC spokesman.Under the third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war may only be tried in the same courts and according to the same rules, as soldiers of the country that is holding the prisoners.US officials say that the foreign prisoners captured in Afghanistan are not covered by the third Geneva Convention because they were "bands of people that I don't think would meet the criteria of organized military activity," as Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hanson put it."This is one reason why the Americans are nervous about applying the POW convention in all its glory," says Adam Roberts, an expert on international law at Oxford University in England, and editor of "Documents on the Laws of War."Human rights organizations, however, have raised questions about the prisoners' housing conditions, which according to the Geneva Convention should be the same standard of those enjoyed by their guards.That means the Al Qaeda suspects could not be tried in the special military tribunals whose rules are currently being worked out, but only by regular US military courts using the Uniform Code of Military Justice.Under the Geneva Conventions, POWs must be returned home at the end of the war.Fate of 'detainees' hangs on US wording PARIS - The future of the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters being held in Cuba is as unclear as the view through the darkened goggles they were made to wear when they stepped off the plane at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay."What is worrying," adds Prof. Roberts, "is that by calling these people 'battlefield detainees', the United States seems to be creating a legal limbo where it is not clear what the legal standards are."US policy towards them "is a new construct of the new military situation we find ourselves in," dealing with irregular forces from a variety of countries who are suspected of terrorism rather than traditional war crimes, Ms. Hanson says.Rather, it appears to be sidestepping the conventions in order to craft an unusual legal strategy that will enable it to try Al Qaeda suspects in special US military tribunals.
