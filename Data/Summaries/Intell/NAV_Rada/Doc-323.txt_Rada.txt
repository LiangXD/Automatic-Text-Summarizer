If Mr. Mugabe wins, "We are going to fight, my friend," said an MDC supporter and trader in Harare's main market, while senior government officials have indicated they will not respect an MDC victory.Author: Jan Cienski HARARE, Zimbabwe - Elements of Zimbabwe's army began leaving their barracks yesterday in an ominous sign that Robert Mugabe intends to rig this weekend's presidential election and is preparing for a fight if the opposition challenges him.It is using state agencies, state institutions that have been built specifically to terrorize the population," Mr. Tsvangirai said yesterday."We are willing to defend the interests of the people of Zimbabwe at all costs and will not stand idly by if the election is clearly not free and fair," he said.The MDC says as many as 34 of its supporters have been killed since the presidential campaign began in January and fears are rising there will be an explosion of violence next week, no matter what the result of the election.Already, his ruling Zimbabwean African National Unity-Patriotic Front party has moved to disenfranchise thousands of supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change."Now is the time to teach everyone, the British first, that when it comes to the issue of defending our national sovereignty, we shall not retreat," he said to an enthusiastic crowd of about 8,000 supporters."If I stay in Harare, I will not be able to vote," said Desire Chikondi, an MDC party worker whose house was burned down this week by ZANU-PF youth militia members and who is now hiding out in the MDC's Harare headquarters.Three MiG-21 fighters flew low over farmland in Mashonaland West in an apparent intimidatory display meant to underline the threat being spread by ruling party thugs: "If President Robert Mugabe loses the election, we will go to war."In Harare yesterday, Michael Quintana, editor of Africa Defence Journal, said he had toured military barracks in the capital and found soldiers were moving out in small groups of three trucks at a time.Meanwhile, a group of up to 800 veterans of Zimbabwe's independence war has asked for foreign help to mount a rebellion against Mr. Mugabe if he steals the election.No one we know to have planned such deeds will escape," Mr. Mugabe said in comments carried by state-owned television."This is our major concern," said Reginald Matchaba-Hove, head of the independent Zimbabwe Election Support Network.The official election watchdog refuses to indicate the number of ballots that will be issued, making it easier to stuff ballot boxes, and has not said where the polling stations will be located.They have never been used before, not even in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo," Mr. Quintana said.The opposition leader has been accused of trying to assassinate Mr. Mugabe.
