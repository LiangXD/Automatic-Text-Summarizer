A cargo ship intercepted in the Channel after a tip-off that it might be carrying terrorist materials was today given the all clear, police said.The ship had sailed from Mauritius and was carrying a cargo of sugar to the Tate &amp;amp; Lyle refinery on the Thames at Silvertown in east London, according to the company.Assistant Commissioner David Veness, head of Scotland Yard's specialist operations, said: "New information, combined with the relentless efforts of scientific experts, our detailed knowledge of the ship and its movements, and very careful examination of the vessel over the last three days leads us to be completely satisfied that the Nisha is not a suspicious vessel and does not pose a danger."The Nisha's cargo of raw sugar is owned by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, which had chartered the vessel, and the vessel was due to dock in east London yesterday.But after a detailed examination of the ship, which is currently moored off the Isle of Wight, nothing suspicious was found, police said."The cargo ship Nisha was intercepted and boarded as part of an intelligence-led operation.The chairman of the British arm of the Great Eastern Shipping Company, Sudhir Mulji, confirmed that the vessel had stopped over at Djibouti before its current journey to drop off American grain as part of a food aid shipment."We had anticipated that detailed examination of the ship might take rather longer.
