& bquo ; To a farmer it '_ s an anathema not to produce on his land and therefore it '_ s not that he is not being responsible in meeting the challenges . & equo ; Many farmers , it turns out , would n't in the least object to making the countryside ?There is a big fear in the hills that in_order_to maintain businesses in the lowlands , people will diversify into sheep , and the profitability of sheep in the lowlands will be greater . & equo ; In fact , the Countryside Commission has just announced an imaginative scheme for 12 & bquo ; community forests & equo ; on marginal urban fringe farmland .& bquo ; In the future , it seems , we are going to be taking arbitrary decisions about what we want from the countryside : the large blue here , a certain bird there , and we are going to manage for those species , which will mean that everything_else will go . & equo ; The countryside may be changing .She goes on : & bquo ; The problem with taking a management decision out_of a farmer '_ s hands as an economic decision and putting it into conservationists hands is that the conservationists do n't always agree .There are also emotional objections . & bquo ; We wish to see as many farmers as possible occupying the countryside , & equo ; said Melinda Appleby . & bquo ; We want to see a working countryside and we do n't want to see it fossilised so it '_ s almost like a theme park . & equo ; Farmers have higher hopes of the & bquo ; extensification & equo ; programme in the wings .There is a Ministry proposal called & bquo ; extensification . & equo ; It means that the whole farm has to produce 20 per_cent less .Conservationists , farmers and government agencies all agree that there is an opportunity right_now for debate and then decision .There are various calculations about how much land is potentially redundant : it could be as many as three million acres .She says one fear is that land in the hills will become redundant . & bquo ; These are areas where you could say farming was marginal .It is called & bquo ; set aside . & equo ; A proportion of the farm ?It depends on what is defined as attractive .Britain is over-producing : there will have to be some way of reducing output .Or be allowed to go on growing ?Another problem is that the wildlife lobby is divided even over simple things like the future of old farm woodlands .But there is no debate , and any decisions are likely to be taken , piecemeal and by default .He could take up agroforestry ; he could convert to timber ; he could take up government agency schemes and grow winter grass mixtures for wild geese to graze upon , or engineer his fields to be a home for the stone curlew .Three million acres or more of Britain '_ s countryside ca n't be left to tumble down to nettles , bracken , Oxford ragwort and rosebay willow herb , punctuated by leisure centres and car parks .Both the farmers and the conservationists agree that there ought_to be a debate .Unfortunately , even this wo n't be enough : the output figures from well-run organic farms are only between 6 and 12 per_cent below those from intensive estates .is set aside , left fallow , mown once a year while the farmer draws a set fee per acre and manages on the rest or gets another job .THE British farmer is about to wander into fresh woods and pastures new .Either way , the countryside changes .So & bquo ; extended & equo ; farms will have to leave a wide strip of unsown soil in each field , and let the hedges grow .They also agree that a debate does n't seem to be taking place .Or he could sell most of his land to Mr Big and his house and a_few acres could fall into the hands of a merchant banker who wants somewhere quiet with a paddock for the daughter '_ s ponies .plus the Commission '_ s other plan for 100,000 acres of new forest in the Midlands , which will also soak up redundant land ?One scheme is already in place .Some farmers are likely to achieve this by converting to organic farming .Miss Melinda Appleby is environmental policy adviser to the National Farmers _' Union .There is a nettle for a somebody ?& bquo ; People were extremely disappointed that conservationists could not come up with exciting positive solutions for potential land that might come out_of agriculture , & equo ; says Miss Appleby .The point is , that for the first time in decades , the environmentalists have a powerful voice ?
