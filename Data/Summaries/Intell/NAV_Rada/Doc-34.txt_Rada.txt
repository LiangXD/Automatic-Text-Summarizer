There are so many bacteria everywhere that picking out a GEM is a_bit like looking for a candle amongst Blackpool '_ s illumination .But the snag is that first you have to be able to recover the GEMs to culture them to do the catechol yellowing test .To develop a recovery method , Morgan , Saunders and Pickup used a Gem called Pseudomonas putida mt-2 , a modified common soil bacterium which may have wide applications for destroying toxic substances .Once you have the GEMs on the polystyrene spheres they can be washed off and cultured for testing with catechol or other techniques .A second problem is that many bacteria living & bquo ; in the wild & equo ; are not always easy to culture in the laboratory .Suspended in water , only the GEM for which the antibodies were specific will attach to the beads .There are concerns that , once released , GEMs might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria .So mt-2 '_ s purified pili and flagellae were injected into animals so that they rapidly produced antibodies specific to them .According_to the researchers , highly specific antibodies have ensured that the technique is a success .Engineering a time delayed & bquo ; lethal gene & equo ; into a GEM to give it a finite life ?is essential because_of the risks involved in letting GEMs out_of the laboratory .The beads plus GEM are recovered with a magnet .are almost certainly the lost GEMs .This GEM ?So_far , none are known to have been released in the UK .The researchers have devised a suite of methods based on detecting a marker gene engineered into the GEM .The gene is very uncommon in nature so any intense yellow colonies of bacteria isolated from the wild ?could suddenly produce a GEM with some nasty trick up its sleeve .It also establishesa system for the review and clearance of products containing genetically modified organisms so that conditions can be established for their marketing . & equo ; Reliable detection is an essential part of the precautions .As a result , it '_ s been estimated that not many more than one per_cent can be cultured at any one time .But losing GEMs could have much farther reaching implications .Their method has been designed for recovering a GEM from water ?The enzyme can be tested for chemically , even in dilute water samples or by using other more complex , state of the art , tricks like DNA amplification .Link: [Comments: zero anaphor of GEMS]is one way .by making a GEM both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ?LOSING your favourite gems may be a personal disaster .GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital .
