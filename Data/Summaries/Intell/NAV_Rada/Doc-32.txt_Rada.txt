Diesel engine manufacturers have long maintained that these are harmless , but recently they have been found to contain polyaromatich hydrocarbons ( PAH ) , which can cause cancer when breathed deeply .Trucks , buses and most taxis use them , and 40 per_cent of vehicle fuel sold in the UK last year was diesel .There are also buses at_least 30 years_old still being run , so it is likely to be decades before the fleet is replaced .By Richard Longworth DIESEL engines are the most fuel efficient vehicle power source available .Currently , diesel fuel sold in the EC contains 0.3 per_cent sulphur , except in West Germany where the level is 0.25 per_cent .It is small wonder that the truck and bus manufacturers based in areas hit worst by acid rain , Volvo and Scania in Sweden and MAN in Bavaria , are working hardest to cut pollutants .Some manufacturers such as MAN and DAF have solved the problem by fitting filters which clean themselves with a small furnace as the vehicle is in operation .These will be electronically controlled , a technical task far harder on a diesel engine than on its petrol counterpart .But diesel engines also have very dirty exhaust emissions .While not having the concentrations of poisonous gases found in petrol engine exhausts , they give out far more & bquo ; particulates & equo ; ( soot ) .Volvo on the other hand is testing buses fitted with filters like dustbins , which are cleaned at the end of a day .The result will be a common level of NOx and particular emissions from vehicles ( measured in grammes per kilowat hour ) from vehicles sold in Europe after 1991 .
