Larry Fine NEW YORK 1997-03-31 Major League Baseball , which is dedicating the 1997 campaign to the anniversary of the most profound change in the game , launches a new season Tuesday full of fresh twists and challenges .The most improved National League team appears to be the Florida Marlins , who added White Sox ace Alex Fernandez , Baltimore slugger Bobby Bonilla and Expos outfielder Moises Alou to make life easier for new manager Jim Leyland .The World Series champion New York Yankees will play the New York Mets , and the Chicago Cubs will battle the Chicago White Sox this season in games that count as nearly 100 years of tradition dissolves with the advent of interleague play .In the American League , the Toronto Blue Jays made the biggest splash in the off season by adding former Red Sox ace Roger Clemens to their formidable starting rotation .Some of the most powerful teams made dramatic changes in preparation for the new season , while two hopefuls made sweeping moves to climb the ladder .East Division teams meet their counterparts in the East , Central plays Central and West gets West in games that represent less than one-tenth of the 162-game schedule .It is fitting that this breaking down of barriers comes as baseball celebrates the greatest dream come true for the game $-- the smashing of the colour line 50 years ago by Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers .Otherwise the off-season was relatively quiet for the Bombers , who hired away Orioles lefty David Wells after New York lefty Jimmy Key signed with Baltimore .Baltimore's biggest change was internal , as iron man Cal Ripken yields his longstanding post at shortstop to Mike Bordick and takes charge at the hot corner that is third base .In interleague play , the designated hitter will be used in American League parks and not in games played on National League ground .The Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves , who two years ago battled in the Series , made a mega-swap rooted in budget strategy as the Tribe sent Kenny Lofton , baseball's best leadoff man , to the Braves for their All-Star outfielder Marquis Grissom and oft-injured slugger David Justice .This introduces new budget concerns for the big market teams that have the cash to sign premier free agents .
