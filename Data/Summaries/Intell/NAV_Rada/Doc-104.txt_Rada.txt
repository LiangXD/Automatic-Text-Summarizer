Indeed, big majorities of drivers surveyed support bans on hand-held cellphone use and texting while driving -- 71 percent and 94 percent, respectively.More than half of drivers said making a cellphone call made no difference to their driving performance, and a quarter said texting or emailing made no difference.The increase in texting while driving came even though many states have banned the practice, and that's alarming, said Jonathan Adkins, a spokesman for the Governors Highway Safety Association.At any given moment last year on America's streets and highways, nearly one in every 100 car drivers was texting, emailing, surfing the Web or otherwise using a hand-held electronic device, the safety administration said.In 2010 there were an estimated 3,092 deaths in crashes affected by a wide range of driver distractions, from eating meals to thumbing email, the safety administration said.But 90 percent said that when they are passengers they feel very unsafe if the driver is texting or emailing.So far, there is no evidence that crashes are reduced when cellphone and texting restrictions are implemented," Rader said."Everyone thinks he or she is an above average driver -- it's all the nuts out there who need educating," said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.But safety advocates are pushing for a national ban on texting while driving.Few drivers said they would never place a call or send a message if they'd seen a police officer, had a child on board or were driving at nighttime or in a marked school zone.There were very few situations in which drivers said they would never talk on the phone or send texts.That number was derived using a new methodology aimed at getting a more precise picture of distracted driving deaths and can't be compared to tallies from previous years, officials said.About twice as many drivers reported answering incoming calls as making calls while driving, 71 percent to 41 percent.
