The Italian senator's words are in sharp contrast to what was contained in the so-called China human rights report compiled by the United States, which blindly accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet."The United Nations has held the high goal of protecting human rights," Jin said.Its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government, human rights experts said at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR) on Friday."The United States was slandering China again," said Xirao-Nima, a professor of Tibetan history at the Central University for Nationalities.The United States has not only made a procedural mistake, but the facts are incorrect, officials said.It has no right to issue such a false human rights report, experts said."His behaviour has violated the Chinese law," said the Rev Cao Shengjie of the China Christian Council.But it nevertheless uses human rights issues to slander China," CSSHR President Zhou Jue said."The United States has violated the UN spirit of not interfering in other countries' internal affairs," said Jin Yongjian, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations.I have seen the truth there, which is very different from what some US politicians with ulterior motives have described," said Xirao-Nima, who is a Tibetan.Those that want to secede from the nation and engage in terrorist activities are terrorists, not any particular ethnic group," said Ma Dazheng, director of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's Development Research Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.The report said China should not have arrested Li, a Hong Kong businessman, who was charged with smuggling Bibles into the country in July.The US human rights report also accuses China of taking advantage of anti-terrorism campaigns to crackdown on ethnic group people living in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
