As with Iran, the Bush administration has tried talk and threats with North Korea.Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, responding to Bush's "axis of evil" remark, said the U.S. government "is the source of evil" in the world.The president told Congress that Iran, Iraq and North Korea pose "a grave and growing danger" because they seek weapons of mass destruction and have links with terrorist groups.But U.S. officials have watched with chagrin in recent weeks as Iran has funneled weapons to its proxies in western Afghanistan and attempted to ship sophisticated arms to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.But Bush's pledge to do whatever is necessary to stop them and nations like them appeared to represent a significant hardening of the U.S. position.'Axis of evil' charge raises questions WASHINGTON -- President Bush's declaration that countries such as Iran, Iraq and North Korea represent an "axis of evil" that must be prevented from acquiring weapons of mass destruction touched off questions around the globe Wednesday.American intelligence has known for a decade or more of attempts by Iran, Iraq and North Korea to develop nuclear weapons, poisons and germs.The rhetoric also caused shudders in U.S. allies South Korea, where President Kim Dae-jung has rested his reputation on easing a half-century of confrontation with the heavily armed communist North, and Japan, which is also within missile range of North Korea.But the president's remarks clearly expanded the scope of his anti-terrorism campaign while elevating the fight against the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons to a major foreign-policy priority, U.S. officials said.
