In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station, Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station.These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 (Space Treaty 1967), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 (Liability Convention 1972), and finally, the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 (Registration Convention 1974).It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre.This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case Australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state.Therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia's objections.It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching."Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre.The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention.The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states' space projects.A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim.The memory Russia's Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of.The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour.Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia's national sovereignty.The treaty also pledges that the launching of space objects be purely for humanitarian purposes and not for military purposes," Priyatna said.Unlike other experts, Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [about the Australian planned space station].
