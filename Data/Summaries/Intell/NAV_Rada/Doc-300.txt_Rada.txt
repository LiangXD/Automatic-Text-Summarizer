Argentina: Right wing sweeps to victory in face of economic crisis The right-wing Peronist party Partido Justicialista (Justice Party) has won the elections of Sunday 14th October for the Argentine Senate and Chamber of Deputies with an absolute majority.The fact that a right-wing party has conquered an absolute majority in Argentina proves the desperation of the people, although 41% of the population voted with spoiled or void votes.The PJ (Peronist) will receive 39 of the 72 seats in the High Chamber against 25 of the Government Alliance (of President de la Rua).
