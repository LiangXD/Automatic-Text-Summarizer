The situation in which Putin has agreed to open former Soviet military airfields to American armed forces in three (former Soviet) Central Asian countries could be regarded as dramatic.But main stream Russian military policy has been to keep a distance from America, the country that has been historically responsible for "educating" the Taliban that had caused the demise of Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan.Putin has exceeded the "positive neutrality policy" his country (the Soviet Union at the time) has pursued during the Gulf War, and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable.If we view this warning against the background that Putin's government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin's hands behind "Chechen terrorism," we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow's views.Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of "international terror."Although these are sovereign states, and the final decision would have been in their hands, people familiar with the actual balance of power indicate that these states would have done nothing, had Moscow wanted a different thing to happen.Nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the United States called upon the Chechens to "unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups," and that they accept Putin's offer to make peace.
