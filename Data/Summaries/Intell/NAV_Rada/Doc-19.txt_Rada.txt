The Austrians are without three players , including Werder Bremen forward Heimo Pfeifenberger who is nursing a broken toe , but coach Herbert Prohaska has remained philosophical .But we are going to Bosnia to win , _" coach Costas Polychroniou said ."_ Poland will be a difficult side to play against but if we go there and play with the same attitude that we showed tonight , then things should go well , _" said Stefano Eranio after the Moldova match ."_ There is no point in sulking , we will have to do with what we have , _" he said .Maldini is likely to stick as closely as possible to Saturday's side although Lazio defender Alessandro Nesta and Parma striker Enrico Chiesa are out .It would put them six points clear at the top of European group two with home games against their main challengers still to come .In group nine , Germany should have a comfortable ride against Albania .Group four throws together the two leaders as Scotland , 2-0 winners over Estonia on Saturday , look to consolidate their place at the top with a win over Austria in Glasgow ."_ I think I_ 'll get a goal and we_ 'll win the match , _" said captain Meho Kodro .In group one , Croatia can go top if they beat pointless Slovenia in Split and leaders Greece slip up against Bosnia in Sarajevo .After a comfortable 4-0 win over San Marino , the Netherlands face a sterner test against Turkey in Ankara as they look to make it five out_of five in group seven .The entire Bosnian team is dangerous and they will certainly play better from the first match in Greece .The game in Chorzow is one of 12 on Wednesday which should shake up the European qualifiers .
