Mission Control's officials also stated that this unplanned space walk would be conducted in order to repair the malfunction, which had appeared in the docking unit during the docking of the Russian Progress M1-7 cargo space ship.Experts believe that the shuttle will be unable to dock the ISS if the Russian cargo ship is not tightly secured to the station.Experts believe that the 4mm gap between the ship and the station's docking unit has been caused by an object, which now prevents the tight joining of the two space vehicles.According to the Russian Mission Control, the space walk may last from 3 to 6 hours because of the mission's difficulty.
