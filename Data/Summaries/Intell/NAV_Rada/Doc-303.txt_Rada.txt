The editor of the Arabic newspaper believes that one should do everything possible to put an end to Bush's imprudence, otherwise the war that he is going to have will overshadow the World Wars.The editor believes that Bush is willing to wage war against Iran and Iraq, because they have weapons of mass destruction, but Bush does not want to notice that Israel also has these kinds of weapons.The editor wrote that Bush showed in his speech that he is craving for blood and is ready to declare war on half of the world in order to take revenge.Palestinian Alhayat Aljadeeda media outlets and the Voice of Palestine radio repeatedly called America the enemy of the Palestinian people after that "axis of evil" statement.
