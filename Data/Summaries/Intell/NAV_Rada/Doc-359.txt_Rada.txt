Mugabe is trying to move the goal posts to disenfranchise people, these people he thinks will vote against him," said Tsvangirai, visiting one polling station where thousands waited angrily to cast their votes, waving their hands in the open-handed signal of the MDC.An increasing number of local election monitors and international observers say the vote rigging has been so thorough that hopes for a free election are dead."I wanted to go home, but I have to vote," she says.The question foremost in the minds of most Zimbabweans is whether attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last- minute election-law changes, and outright fraud have succeeded.The MDC says that 52 percent of its rural polling agents were chased away, abducted, or refused accreditation by government officials, leaving the voting process open to widespread abuse."This is not a fair election," he says.There are many Marthas here, people who marched to ZANU-PF anthems and cheered President Robert Mugabe at rallies, while secretly planning to vote for Mr. Tsvangirai.The government slashed the number of polling stations in urban areas where the MDC is favored, while boosting the number in rural ruling-party strongholds.Now the country's 5.6 million voters are waiting anxiously for the results of the poll to be announced, although the voting, which was supposed to end Sunday, may stretch on for days."I am happy because I finally got to vote," says a jubilant Colin Chipepera, after waiting for more than 12 hours in one Harare voting line.In Kuwadzana, there were seven polling stations for about 55,000 people.Rural Bindura had 41 polling stations for a smaller number of people.That was my bed," says Janet, a Harare secretary, who waited for more than 27 hours at a polling station in the impoverished Harare suburb of Kuwadzana.
