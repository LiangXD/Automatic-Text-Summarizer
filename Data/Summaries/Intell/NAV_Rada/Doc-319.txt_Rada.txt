Amnesty International issued a press release accusing the United States of "keeping prisoners incommunicado, (using) sensory deprivation, the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them" in an effort to 'break' the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation."AFTER SPENDING months in frigid Afghanistan caves subsisting on Allah knows what, the 158 detainees the United States is holding in tropical Guantanamo Bay must think they've died and gone to heaven.Instead, Amnesty International and the comrades are outraged that the military is treating al Qaeda captives like prisoners.And they apparently don't care if the criticism makes them look clueless as to what really is inhumane.It should be noted that much of the uproar is over photographs of the detainees taken as they were being transported from airplanes to their cells.Does Amnesty International think that wearing a hood on an airplane is sensory deprivation, instead of a security measure?As for the "unnecessary restraint," one detainee has announced that he wants to kill an American before he leaves Cuba, and another detainee bit a guard, according to Pentagon spokesman Capt.Then there's the reporter who asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld if American Taliban John Walker will be treated the same as the detainees.Then there's the status of the detainees.Also, a British Foreign Ministry team, which spent three days at Club Gitmo, reported that three British citizens being held there had "no complaints about their treatment."
