apart from criticizing the axis of evil countries for abusing human rights, it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti-terrorist alliance. since israel suffers from terrorist attacks, the report says, it has been forced to take counter-terrorism measures, making its rights abuses understandable. in exchange for support for its war on terror, the us is tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by other members of the anti-terror coalition. even though almost all military mobilizations in history have been motivated by notions of good versus evil or of orthodoxy versus unorthodoxy, efforts to present the naked pursuit of us interests as a battle of good versus evil reflect a lack of understanding and tolerance. to prove that human rights are important ammunition in the battle against terror, then, the us must attack terrorism to make human rights matter to these countries. if, however, us president george w. bush still believes in the supremacy of human rights, he must not forget the breeding ground for terrorists that exists within the anti-terrorist alliance. if the us, which claims to be the world's policeman, is incapable of looking beyond us interests or of practicing the universal values of human rights, democracy and peace, then shouldn't the international community reconsider the role played by the un, or learn from the way the european parliament works?
