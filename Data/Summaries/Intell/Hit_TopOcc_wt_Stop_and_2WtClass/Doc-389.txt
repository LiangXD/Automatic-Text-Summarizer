bush takes great leap forward in pledging u.s. help in defending taiwan in a closed-door meeting in florida last week, the bush administration took a great leap forward in its declared policy that taiwan remain separate from china so long as the people of taiwan wish, even if that requires u.s. military force. the host of the three-day u.s.-taiwan defense summit was frank carlucci, chairman of the u.s.-taiwan business council, onetime deputy director of central intelligence, national security adviser to president reagan, later secretary of defense and possibly the most secretive official in washington in many years. that tang was invited was more evidence that bush has adopted the most pro-taiwan posture of any president in nearly a quarter century his stance differs distinctly from that of president clinton, who tilted in favor of beijing. the senior u.s. official at the gathering was deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz, who has written: it would be a strategic as well as a moral mistake for the united states to ever let china use force to have its way with taiwan. bush began enunciating his policy on taiwan in november 1999, saying that he would honor our promises to the people of taiwan and we deny the right of beijing to impose their rule on a free people. the most succinct statement of the bush policy came from secretary of state colin powell during his senate confirmation hearing in january 2001: we expect and demand a peaceful settlement, one acceptable to people on both sides of the taiwan strait. whatever decision bush makes, a defense official said, the pacific command is ready to respond to any potential crisis, including the use of force against taiwan by china.
