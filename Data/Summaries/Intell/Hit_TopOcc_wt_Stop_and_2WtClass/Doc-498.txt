australia's plans to construct a space port on christmas island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of jakarta, has concerned some in the indonesian government. although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the national space and flight agency has already warned of the possible risks facing indonesia. therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from christmas island if australia is really willing to listen to indonesia's objections. this section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the international claims commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state. it is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching. in the case of objections to the christmas island space station, indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the christmas island station. the kangaroo country should implement risk management procedures before opening the space station on christmas island, and open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states, and open complete access to cooperation to all states without exception.
