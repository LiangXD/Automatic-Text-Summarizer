but that doesn't bother an increasing number of well-heeled executives and celebrities willing to pay millions of dollars and spend a few months training in exchange for a quick trip to orbit. there is a lot of pent-up demand, at least emotionally among a large number of people to journey into space, says john logsdon, of the space policy institute at george washington university in washington, d.c. for example, in 2000, harris interactive surveyed americans' and canadians' willingness to travel into space as tourists. extrapolating from the results, space adventures, which commissioned the study, estimates that 10,000 people a year would be willing to pay $100,000 apiece for a quick up-and-down suborbital flight, a la mercury astronaut alan shepard. if they received the trip as a promotion or gift, 80 percent of the respondents said they'd take an intercontinental space-plane, 70 percent would take a space-station tour or an orbital flight, and 74 percent would be willing to take a suborbital journey. you need a strong, growing us space transportation system, and the federal... decision that it's in the national interest to fund... a second generation reusable launch vehicle to supplant the shuttle at a sufficiently low cost that it would be commercially viable, he says. some 20 companies and groups worldwide are in a competition for a $10 million purse offered to the first firm that can build and fly a two-stage, reusable rocket that can carry three people on a suborbital flight and be refurbished for its next flight within two weeks. the contest already is stimulating a range of related efforts, ranging from states trying to set up space ports for tourism flights, to federal aviation administration development of licensing requirements for private commercial launch facilities and passenger operations.
