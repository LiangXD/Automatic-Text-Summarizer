for_once , the uk is in the good books of the european space agency ( esa ) for our support of the european remote sensing ( ers ) programme , which will use the most complex satellites it has ever attempted to build. & bquo it '_ s one of the most important projects we have for the 1990s , & equo says philip goldsmith , head of earth observation at the european space agency. whilst other space agencies have equally ambitious plans , they remain as blueprints , or , as one european scientist puts it , & bquo pie-in-the-sky-eyes-in-the-sky. & equo ers-1 has five instruments which will scan the earth at microwave wavelengths to monitor ocean , ice and land resources. how the wind affects the ocean and modifies the heat exchanged with the atmosphere is not well understood , but is of paramount importance to weather forecasters who can not wait for ers-1 to begin operations. though esa admits there have been electronic problems with one of the system '_ s processors , it '_ s hardly surprising. & bquo it '_ s the most complex instrument we '_ ve ever built , & equo says joe mccaughey , marconi '_ s project manager. & bquo ers as a whole is a quantum leap for europe. & equo the rutherford appleton laboratory in oxfordshire has provided the along-track scanning radiometer , an infrared instrument which will measure sea surface temperatures down to 0.3c. & bquo there are americans who '_ d give their eye teeth for this sort of data , & equo says one ers project scientist at the laboratory. nearly 10 per_cent of the earth '_ s surface is covered by ice , which remains as terra incognita to climatologists as it was to 17th-century explorers. ers-1 is expected to return the first quantitive data on these processes at the poles. & bquo the key to the ers programme is continuity , & equo says guy duchossois of esa headquarters. india , pakistan , indonesia , brazil and kenya have asked to receive data from ers-1 , which will be made available to them within three hours of it being transmitted from the satellite.
