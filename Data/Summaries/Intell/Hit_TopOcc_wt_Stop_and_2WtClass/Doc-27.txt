dr eric edwards of the shellfish association says : & bquo customer reaction is that they are stylish and upmarket. & equo demand in europe and north america continues to rise by 4 per_cent a year $- despite the fact that natural sources are already overfished. a team led by dr david jones , of bangor '_ s renowned school of ocean sciences , designed a revolutionary new feed , using a process called microencapsulation which puts a thin , digestible membrane around each tiny food particle. & bquo it '_ s exactly the same , essentially , as making nylon , & equo he says. & bquo to do that , you take a_lot_of identical molecules called amines and join them together to form a chain. by drawing the polymer off , new cross-links are formed and you go on drawing the thread until all the constituents are used up. & bquo now if , instead_of having a single interface between the two liquids , you emulsify the two ( like oil and vinegar in french dressing ) the reaction occurs over the surface of each suspended droplet , creating a capsule. & equo originally , the team mixed prawn nutrients with amines , thinking that they would be needed to form the capsule. we '_ ve learnt an enormous amount because the microcapsule is such an ideal tool for simplifying and controlling food intake. & equo dr jones and his team are now extending their work to other species , and to the post-larval stage , which leads to the ultimate product ? the prawn on the end of your fork. and expertise gained has enabled the university to launch a new msc course in shellfish biology , fisheries and culture ? due_to take its first students in the coming academic year. & bquo the commercial aspects are very good , of_course ? though i still find the teaching and research spin-offs the most exciting part of it all , & equo says dr jones. but dr jones '_ s involvement with industry has led him into difficulties ? which lend a critical edge to the parable. & bquo frippak support our work generously , & equo he says. & bquo but they are understandably reluctant to pay for research students , because they will probably go off and join the competition. but i do n't see why they should be asked to shoot themselves in the foot by paying to train a competitor '_ s workforce , and neither do they ! & equo the end result is that dr jones takes on overseas researchers. & bquo that '_ s fine as far as i am concerned & equo he says. & bquo they do n't cost british industry or taxpayers a thing , but of_course they take all their expertise abroad. & bquo whatever the government '_ s idea is , i do n't think that '_ s it , somehow. & equo
