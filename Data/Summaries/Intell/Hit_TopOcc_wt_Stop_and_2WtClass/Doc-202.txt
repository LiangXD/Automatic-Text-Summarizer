each side has a different story with respect to the treatment for pows it is reported that the us armed forces are regarding the captives interned in guantanamo as dangerous terrorists and islamic muslims. but people still question why the us government refuses to characterize the detainees in guantanamo as prisoners of war while claiming that the treatment for them is in line with the geneva convention on pows. if it chooses to characterize these detainees as pows, then it must release some of them sooner or later and it is very likely that these people will again attack the united states with terrorist means. the detainees' status -- an issue concerning their life and death after visiting the guantanamo prisoners' camp, many international organizations and media are accusing the united states of being too harsh for the prisoners. us secretary of defense rumsfeld said that the afghanistan's taliban and al-qaeda members are unlawful combatants, not pows, and so the united states would not treat them as pows and they would not enjoy any rights prescribed in the geneva convention on pows. one thing the international community feels incomprehensible is that why are these taliban and al-qaeda members not considered as pows since, before the war they were organized combatants, the battles they fought were also organized resistance, and they were obviously captured in battles during the war? what worries the west and some other countries most is that, if the united states refuses to treat these detainees as pows, then their soldiers may be treated the same way as the guantanamo prisoners should they be captured by the taliban remnants and other radical organizations when they take part in the united nations' peace-keeping missions.
