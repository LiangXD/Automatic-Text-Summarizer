the next mission for nasa could be to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program. in doing so, the white house is swapping the silver-visored helmet of a space cadet for the green eyeshade of a consummate bean counter. where mr. goldin was a product of the us aerospace industry, mr. o'keefe has served as chief financial officer for the pentagon, navy secretary, and business-school professor. o'keefe is not known as a space enthusiast, says keith cowing, a former nasa scientist and editor of nasawatch.com. under goldin, unmanned craft found evidence of water on the moon, inaugurated a long-term program to explore mars, and opened the door to competition from the aerospace industry and universities to plan and execute missions. but the agency's credibility has come under fire in manned spaceflight - especially the international space station, now completing its first year of full-time crews. o'keefe's appointment is a clear message from the administration: nasa has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we'd like to see nasa do, says patricia dasch of the national space society.
