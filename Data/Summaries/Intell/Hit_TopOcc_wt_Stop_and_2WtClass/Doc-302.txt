two russian cosmonauts to conduct space walk two russian cosmonauts, vladimir dezhurov and mikhail tyurin, are expected to perform a space walk on the international space station (iss) at about 04:00 pm moscow time. mission control's officials also stated that this unplanned space walk would be conducted in order to repair the malfunction, which had appeared in the docking unit during the docking of the russian progress m1-7 cargo space ship. experts believe that the 4mm gap between the ship and the station's docking unit has been caused by an object, which now prevents the tight joining of the two space vehicles. according to the russian mission control, the space walk may last from 3 to 6 hours because of the mission's difficulty. the cosmonauts will have to use the electric motor of the docking unit to manually un-dock the progress m1-7 to the distance of not more than one meter from the station. the russian mission control also reported that the forthcoming launch of the american endeavour space shuttle totally depended on the success of the aforementioned repair works. experts believe that the shuttle will be unable to dock the iss if the russian cargo ship is not tightly secured to the station.
