fate of 'detainees' hangs on us wording paris - the future of the taliban and al qaeda fighters being held in cuba is as unclear as the view through the darkened goggles they were made to wear when they stepped off the plane at the us military base in guantanamo bay. already, washington's refusal to grant them official prisoner-of- war status has sparked protests from human rights groups, and a disagreement with the international committee of the red cross (icrc), which oversees the geneva conventions. this is one reason why the americans are nervous about applying the pow convention in all its glory, says adam roberts, an expert on international law at oxford university in england, and editor of documents on the laws of war. us officials say that the foreign prisoners captured in afghanistan are not covered by the third geneva convention because they were bands of people that i don't think would meet the criteria of organized military activity, as pentagon spokeswoman susan hanson put it. human rights organizations, however, have raised questions about the prisoners' housing conditions, which according to the geneva convention should be the same standard of those enjoyed by their guards. i don't think anything quite like this was envisioned when the geneva conventions were drawn up, says tom farer, dean of denver university's graduate school of international studies and a former special assistant to the defense department's special counsel. what is worrying, adds prof. roberts, is that by calling these people 'battlefield detainees', the united states seems to be creating a legal limbo where it is not clear what the legal standards are. back to top untitled copyright @ 2002 the christian science monitor.
