given the degree of uncertainty that prevails over the inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates and over the economy's real gross domestic product (gdp) this year, the approach should not be the traditional one, the finance minister says. in argentina's defense, malan says that brazil's mercosur partner has sought to define with clarity the fundamental issues of its basic regimes - foreign exchange (floating exchange rate regime), monetary (they intend, after phase of transition, to define their inflation goal system, which was important to spain from 1995-1998) and fiscal. this, the minister insists, is why it makes no sense to demand that everything be done in one or two weeks, referring to what the imf and some governments, like that of the united states, are asking. the minister believes that tension between brazil and argentina, resulting from the floating of the real in 1999, will tend to disappear because the neighboring country is opting for a floating exchange rate system. according to the minister, mercosur managed, after an enormous technical effort,' something that did not exist in the region two years ago - the harmonization of the statistics of the member countries, bolivia and chile, which were not comparable before. the finance minister says he hopes, for mercosur, something similar to what happened in the eu: an ability to look decades ahead and not let oneself get beaten down, like in some countries that dedicate themselves to lamenting, that see the difficulties as being insurmountable, and the problems as being unsolvable. malan defends a different posture: to set aside the notion of cynicism, skepticism, that things will not work out, and believe, like the europeans, that there is a future to be built by the mercosur countries and chile and bolivia, the associate members.
