there are many marthas here, people who marched to zanu-pf anthems and cheered president robert mugabe at rallies, while secretly planning to vote for mr. tsvangirai. after months of fear and intimidation, zimbabweans streamed to the polls this weekend in record numbers to cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. the question foremost in the minds of most zimbabweans is whether attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last- minute election-law changes, and outright fraud have succeeded. an increasing number of local election monitors and international observers say the vote rigging has been so thorough that hopes for a free election are dead. mr. murphy points to the lack of independent voter education, the lack of any independent radio stations, and the ban on holding opposition rallies in many districts as just a few examples. mugabe is trying to move the goal posts to disenfranchise people, these people he thinks will vote against him, said tsvangirai, visiting one polling station where thousands waited angrily to cast their votes, waving their hands in the open-handed signal of the mdc. old and illiterate voters were assisted by zanu-pf officials who often directed them to vote for the incumbent president.
