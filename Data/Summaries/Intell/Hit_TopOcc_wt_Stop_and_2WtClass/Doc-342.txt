following a campaign wracked by intense violence and intimidation blamed on the ruling party, opposition leader morgan tsvangirai said he was pleased to see so many people voting, believing a strong turnout favored him over the man who has ruled this country since independence in 1980. but with voting going very slowly at some stations, tsvangirai accused authorities of holding things up to hurt his chances in the two days of voting. mugabe, whose rule had never faced significant dissent until recent years with the economic troubles, has painted tsvangirai and his movement for democratic change as servants to white interests and western powers who want to see the country fail. his aides were informed of the gaffe, and he was whisked to another station, where his name was listed. police have canceled scores of opposition rallies and mugabe has used his presidential powers to restore controversial election laws struck down by the supreme court that appear to make it easier to rig the vote. mugabe, 78, has promised public works initiatives if he is re-elected and has pledged to continue his controversial program of seizing white-owned farms and giving them to landless blacks. the opposition had asked the supreme court to overturn mugabe's decree restoring the controversial election laws, as well as to resolve confusion over voter registration and the location of polling stations and allow the polls to remain open if long lines made it impossible for some to vote.
