foreign firms furiously lobby in argentina buenos aires -- foreign multinational companies trying to avoid billions in losses furiously lobbied argentine lawmakers and the new government ahead of today's final vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the u.s. dollar. many political analysts fear a return to street violence when the devaluation measure passes and companies seek to avoid losses by raising prices for food and medicine. his package of legislation seeks -- at the expense of foreign and domestic companies -- to ease the pain on an increasingly angry middle class, the largest in south america. most debt in dollars more than 80 percent of personal debt in argentina is in dollars, and most of that debt is held by the middle class. foreign companies are also trying to reverse a portion of the emergency package that proposes to end a decade of billing in dollars at the gas pump, or for fixed and cellular phone services, water and power bills and the like. it doesn't just hit the initial direct investment in argentina but all those suppliers throughout the chain of supply that can be impacted," said meril markely, a houston-based director of tax and accounting services in south america for kpmg. foreign companies that took over former state transportation, phone and energy companies want -- but appear unlikely to get -- some form of indexing so they can raise their prices to compensate for what is expected to be a widening gap between the peso and dollar.
