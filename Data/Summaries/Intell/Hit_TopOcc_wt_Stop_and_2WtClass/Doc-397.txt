britain's prescott pushes for kyoto pact backing vancouver, british columbia -- the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be ratified even without u.s. support, british deputy prime minister john prescott told an international conference on business and the environment on friday. prescott said that while the u.s. decision to reject the kyoto agreement is a cause for concern, pressure will be maintained on the bush administration to go further with its current voluntary emission-reduction targets. this is the world's best chance of dealing with a very serious threat to it, prescott told delegates from 65 nations at the globe 2002 conference in vancouver that ended on friday. prescott, britain's front man in pushing the accord, said the united states until recently was critical of the science that led to the kyoto pact but has now accepted it, and he remains optimistic that the goals of the united states and of other signatory nations would converge. the kyoto protocol calls on countries to reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are blamed by many scientists for global warming, to pre-1990 levels by 2012. prescott said the british program aims to cut emissions by 20 percent, and the country is now half way to that goal. a study by the canadian manufacturers and exporters association said the accord would cost the canadian economy up to c$40 billion by 2010, but a dutch report released earlier this week said it would only be c$727 million.
