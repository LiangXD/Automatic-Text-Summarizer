it is not enough to proclaim, even in the constitution, that one peso is worth one dollar, for that to be really the case. hence the official parity between the peso and the dollar until 1 december 2001 when it became necessary to introduce exchange controls with a devastating effect. michael mussa, chief economist with the imf until last april, recognizes this: if we had paid more attention to the growing budgetary deficit and national debt between 1996 and 1998, argentina would have been in a much better position to absorb the impact of the devaluation of the brazilian real. but this chinese territory has an extremely open economy, to the point where its exports exceed its gdp, thereby facilitating the influx of foreign currency. over recent weeks street demonstrations culminating in the general strike of 13 december have been the most visible aspect of a civil war between creditors and debtors. appeals were already made to the creditors during the first phase of the debt rescheduling involving the $55 billion held by argentine funds and that was completed at the end of november. but it would also be a very painful way of restoring credibility, like when one loses one's virginity and the only solution is to enter a convent, as one monetary expert put it.
