intelogic trace inc., san antonio, texas, said it bought 2.7 million shares, or about 18%, of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $3.625 a share, or $9.9 million. the move boosts intelogic chairman asher edelman's stake to 20% from 16.2% and may help prevent martin ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern. mr. ackerman already is seeking to oust mr. edelman as chairman of datapoint corp., an intelogic affiliate. the action followed by one day an intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including the possible sale of the company. mr. edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves, saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when the company is on a roll. he added, this has nothing to do with marty ackerman and it is not designed, particularly, to take the company private. but mr. ackerman said the buy-back, and the above-market price paid, prove that mr. edelman is running scared.
