but the current development of events, that is, the standstill situation, makes it clear that us foreign policy has been put to a very serious test in which the united states needs to discipline its decades-long ally, israel, and not ruin its relations with the arabs. sharon, who used to be a colonel and who is directly responsible for the massacre in the beirut camps sabra and shatila, used his return to power as an opportunity to settle the accounts with his years-long enemies. in relation to the first ambiguity, powell's words definitely cannot be taken seriously, considering that precisely washington is the one that has been practicing a one-sided approach to the events in the middle east for 18 months now and it was the chief opponent of the positioning of peace troops between the two warring sides. with an average $3 billion military aid for israel and a strong jewish lobby at home, the untied states cannot play any other role in the middle east conflict but protector of the israeli state. it would be entirely improper if, in its defense of israel, the united states continues to exert pressure on neighboring arab countries, such as, syria and lebanon, which have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations, such as the hezbolah. europe does not have a united stance on the violence in ramallah, nablus, bethlehem, and the palestinian refugee camps, despite the clear situation that israel is the only country in the world that secures its borders by occupying territories of another state. the eu's efforts and us president bush's peace initiative through secretary of state powell seem like a late resolution, considering that approximately one month ago the arab countries participating in the summit in beirut held out an olive branch to israel through the plan of saudi arabia's heir to the throne, prince abdullah, which contained two points: recognition of a palestinian state [as published] in an arab neighborhood, in return for recognition of the palestinians' right to their own country.
