billions of investors' dollars are pouring out of the nation's junk-bond mutual funds, undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market. last week alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, according to estimates by dalbar financial services inc., a boston research firm. in the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, dalbar says. their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months. mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts, and to a lesser extent, government-bond funds. the 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $32 billion. about 98% of the outflow was transferred to other fidelity funds, says neal litvack, a fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going into money market funds.
