why kyoto is a rip-off according to a study released last week by the canadian manufacturers and exporters, implementation of the 1997 kyoto global warming treaty would cost our economy 450,000 jobs and as much as $40-billion. according to a report released in 2000 by the national air issues co-ordinating committee on climate change, a group staffed by officials from the federal, provincial and territorial governments, hitting canada's kyoto target may mean the loss of roughly one year's growth, or, viewed in absolute terms, in 2010, the loss in annual economic output of approximately $40-billion (or $1,100 per capita). by 2010, our $40-billion sacrifice would yield an expected reduction in annual carbon and carbon-equivalent emissions of about 46-million tonnes -- just 1/200th of the world's total projected greenhouse gas output. according to the u.s. energy information administration, world energy consumption will increase by about 60% between now and 2020, with most of the upsurge expected to come from developing nations, which are not covered by the kyoto protocol. instead of trying to cap carbon dioxide emissions -- a costly burden at home and an impossible task in the developing world -- we should focus on abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations. while helping third world nations plant new crops, vaccinate people and relocate coastal towns will be costly, the bottom line will likely be only a fraction of kyoto's 13-digit price tag. climate change/kyoto protocol activities a list of related meetings, conferences projects and reports on the accord hosted by the united nations industrial development organization.
