president hugo chavez is once again at the helm of power, and the military has returned to its barracks. their loved ones were gunned down, first by sympathizers of mr. chavez and subsequently by supporters of the short-lived interim government. mr. chavez has placed his cronies in every democratic institution, from congress to the courts, and is expected to prevent any honest inquiry. according to taped radio conversations broadcast yesterday in venezuela on radio and television, mr. chavez ordered tanks and troops to surround the presidential palace, as unarmed civilian protesters marched against him on april 11. we are happy to collectively have overcome the era of coup d'etats in the region, and when events in venezuela took on the appearance of a military coup there was a reaction by everyone, said brazil's president fernando henrique cardoso. the venezuelan leader has struck friendships with cuban, libyan and iraqi leaders with great fanfare, and his open defiance of u.s. interests has wooed venezuelans wary of u.s. power. interestingly, mr. chavez initially rose to power in the 1990s because of the discontent with former president carlos andres perez, who had ordered the military to shoot at crowds in 1989.
