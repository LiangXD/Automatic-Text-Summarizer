dear , a few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with goodwill's help. here's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely source: goodwill's controller, juli. in addition to that, by helping them find jobs, goodwill reduced the state's public support tab by an estimated $4 million. after maureen's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant, we helped maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society. at goodwill she gained in self-confidence, in her vision of her future and in the job skills she needed to find and keep a good job. your gift to goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their own stories of success. for every dollar donated to goodwill in 1998, we helped our graduates earn an estimated $102.
