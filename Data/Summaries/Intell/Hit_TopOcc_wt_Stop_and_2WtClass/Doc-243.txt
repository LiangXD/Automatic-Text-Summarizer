john c. marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5% annually through the next three years. in the past 20 months alone, paul e. lego, president and chief operating officer, said the divestiture of $300 million of slow-growth, low-profit businesses has been more than offset by $600 million in profitable acquisitions. even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of 2% to 2.5%, we can handle that, mr. marous said. mr. marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company's target goal of 8.5%. the company's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with mitsubishi heavy industries, mr. lego said. he said the independent power segment could grow to provide as much as 50% of near-term generation capacity, adding: we expect to supply a significant share of this market. company officials also said that any gain from the sale of westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the swiss firm of asea brown boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
