although the white house and the pentagon have denied supporting the oppositions in venezuela to stage this coup, the world will not be easily fooled as it can judge from the several official statements made by the us government both before and after the coup. when chavez resumed power, a senior us official in charge of national security commented that chavez should reflect on himself, as his ship has been sailing towards a wrong direction for far too long. this special meeting was initiated by the united states, with only one single goal to fulfill, that is, instigating opcw member states to vote out bustani. it has been reported that the united states had earlier held a secret meeting with a number of countries, promising to pay for their long due opcw membership fees if they could vote according to the wish of the united states. why has the united states been picking on chavez and bustani all this time? when questioned by a reporter why the united states has supported a certain cold-blooded dictator in latin america, roosevelt gave a vivid reply: this dictator may be a son of bitch, yet he is our (the united states) son of bitch. it turns out that in the dictionary used by the united states, the definition of a democratic regime is subjected to double standards.
