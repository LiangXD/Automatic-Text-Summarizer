most disturbing are pronouncements by senior government officials and military leaders that they would not allow this former british colony to be led by tsvangirai and his political party, the movement for democratic change. in a television interview broadcast the other day, didymus mutasa, a spokesman for mugabe's ruling zanu-pf party, said that he and other veterans of the country's independence war found the prospect of a tsvangirai government intolerable. government officials last month charged tsvangirai and two other officials of his party with high treason for allegedly plotting to assassinate mugabe. opposition officials say that 22 of their polling agents have been abducted in the past week, and a surge in violent attacks in swing districts could persuade enough opposition supporters to vote for zanu-pf to ensure mugabe's victory. zanu-pf officials have told election observers that they intend to increase the number of polling stations in rural areas believed to be their strongholds and reduce the number of stations in urban areas, where there is strong support for the opposition. that, according to foreign diplomats and tsvangirai supporters, could disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of young opposition supporters who live with their parents. that could ease pressure on mugabe to remain in power to avoid prosecution for his government's attack in the 1980s in matabeleland, the home of the ndebele tribe, which at the time posed the most significant threat to his leadership.
