harare, march 17 (xinhua) -- despite western pressure on him over his re-election victory, zimbabwean president robert mugabe was sworn in on sunday as the country's head of state to serve another six-year term. at the state house, where the ceremony was held, thousands of zanu-pf supporters in clothing emblazoned with mugabe's portrait, were singing and dancing to celebrate his victory, with a hope that mugabe will finally deliver on his promises to give them the land currently owned by the country's white minority. he said the program, under which the government was taking over idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of zimbabwe's arable land, to resettle landless blacks, would form the centerpiece of his efforts to revive the economy. in his campaign for re-election, the zimbabwean leader repeatedly accused britain and its western allies of trying to re-assert neocolonial rule in zimbabwe, and the region, by installing a compliant opposition party in power. however, mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity, incorporating his closest rival in the poll, to ensure political and economic stability in zimbabwe. diplomats here said a government of national unity was partly intended to allow britain and the united states to save face over their insistence on the mdc' s victory in zimbabwe's election. mdc leader tsvangirai said pre-election violence prevented his party from campaigning in rural areas, the stronghold of the ruling party, and that thousands of his supporters in towns were disenfranchised when they failed to vote because authorities reduced polling centers in urban areas.
