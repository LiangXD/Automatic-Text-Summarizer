there is a great deal of truth in that, but in the light of what has happened afterwards, the question arises as to whether the americans and their allies themselves are not sometimes inclined to sacrifice these values for the good cause. apart from the reasons or justification for such an action, all the combatants' war conduct must be constantly tested against the standards of international humanitarian law that is, the rules which curb the use of force during a military operation. many countries are parties to them, but the united states has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which us troops are taking part. secretary rumsfeld's statements (on 20 november 2001) that the united states is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners, and that my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the northern alliance) also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the taliban and al-qa'ida fighters. humanitarian law leaves no doubt that those who fall captive in their opponent's hands are entitled at all times to decent treatment, even if they do not qualify for prisoner of war status. transporting these people, shackled hand and foot and with hoods over their heads, shaving their beards -- which form part of their religious identity -- and their accommodation in half-open and cages that are much too small can probably never pass this test... out of well-understood self-interest, countries such as russia, china, and israel joined in the bush administration's anti-terrorism campaign, because it enabled them to compare their domestic situation with the us situation and ask for moral support for the fight they have been waging against terrorism for years.
