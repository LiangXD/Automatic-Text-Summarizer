zimbabwe's rigged election the election this week in zimbabwe was an ugly travesty from which all of southern africa will suffer. international observers called the process deeply flawed, and the bush administration has refused to recognize the declared results. unfortunately, some leading african countries like south africa and nigeria have compounded the problem by accepting mugabe's victory despite earlier assertions that they would not recognize the results of a rigged election. by failing to hold firm they not only damage their diplomatic credibility, but also ignore the consequences for nearby african states of mugabe's misrule. these include explosive political frustration, a swelling tide of desperate refugees and a growing reluctance by foreign companies and donors to invest in the region. washington and other western governments may now strengthen the current mild sanctions against zimbabwe. mugabe, who led zimbabwe's liberation struggle against white minority rule in the late 1970's, has systematically wrecked his country's economy and its freedoms to prolong his 22-year-old hold on power.
