u.s. refuses to recognize mugabe government u.s. president bush said wednesday that flaws in zimbabwe's election will prevent the united states from recognizing the government's claim that incumbent robert mugabe was the winner. bush told a news conference that the united states is consulting with other countries to decide how to deal with this flawed election. bush suspended u.s. entry privileges for mugabe, his family or senior members of his government. he also denied entry to those who received significant financial benefit from dealings with zimbabwean officials who carried out mugabe's policies. u.s. officials said the administration may freeze assets of zimbabwean officials involved in the alleged rigging of the democratic process. another possibility is the banning of commercial export licenses of defense articles and services. copyright by people's daily online, all rights reserved
