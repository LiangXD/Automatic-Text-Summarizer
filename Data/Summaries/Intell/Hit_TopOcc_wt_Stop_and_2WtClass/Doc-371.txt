angry at vote, commonwealth bars zimbabwe london, march 19 - flanked by the presidents of south africa and nigeria, prime minister john howard of australia today announced a yearlong suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth, a group of 54 nations, mostly former british colonies. the two african leaders, thabo mbeki of south africa and olusegun obasanjo of nigeria, maintained a cryptic silence while mr. howard spoke, endorsing the decision by their presence at a news conference but avoiding embroilment in a debate over whether they now view mr. mugabe's presidency as illegitimate. it means zimbabwean officials will be barred from meetings held by the commonwealth, an organization that carries some cachet as an important club bridging the north-south divide. mr. mbeki and mr. obasanjo - both of whose countries have under past undemocratic regimes been excluded from the commonwealth - are torn between solidarity with a fellow african leader who was a crusader against colonialism, and their commitment to democratic standards as part of african economic regeneration. the committee has decided to suspend zimbabwe from the councils of the commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate effect, mr. howard said, reading the statement alone, apparently as a face-saving gesture to mr. mbeki, whose own election observers in zimbabwe found the vote legitimate. the response to mr. mugabe's behavior was seen by many outsiders as a token of south africa's and nigeria's own commitment to democracy as a way of fostering economic renewal. at a meeting in monterrey, mexico, for instance, the financier george soros said today that the zimbabwe elections have cast doubt on the ability of the african states to create suitable conditions for private investment.
