26 (cna) -- it is unlikely that the vatican will establish diplomatic ties with mainland china any time soon, judging from their differences on religious issues, ministry of foreign affairs (mofa) spokeswoman chang siao-yue said wednesday. chang's remark came in response to a foreign wire report that mainland china and the vatican are preparing to bridge their differences and may even pave the way for full diplomatic relations. beijing authorities are expected to take advantage of a large religious meeting slated for october 14 in beijing to develop the possibility of setting up formal relations with the vatican, according to the report. in response, chang said the beijing leadership will have chances to boost exchanges with holy see officials in the next few weeks, including in the religious meeting to be held oct. in addition to catholic scholars from around the world, former italian prime minister giulio andreotti will also take part in the symposium to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the start of italian jesuit matteo ricci's mission to china in 1601, chang noted. the mofa spokeswoman affirmed that from the angle of eastern and western cultural exchanges, the sponsoring of similar conferences will be instrumental to mainland chinese people's better understanding of catholicism and its contributions to chinese society. as for the development of diplomatic relations between mainland china and the vatican, chang noted that differences between the beijing leadership and the holy see on religious issues dates from long ago, so it is impossible for the vatican to broach this issue with beijing for the time being.
