leaders of the united states probably withheld their breath monday evening while watching on television what russian president vladimir putin was about to say to his people. the military great power that towers over afghanistan has committed itself to overthrow the ruling taliban system, and has pledged to support the us anti-terrorism military operation now being prepared. although these are sovereign states, and the final decision would have been in their hands, people familiar with the actual balance of power indicate that these states would have done nothing, had moscow wanted a different thing to happen. but main stream russian military policy has been to keep a distance from america, the country that has been historically responsible for educating the taliban that had caused the demise of soviet occupation forces in afghanistan. putin did not receive what he sought in a quick response from washington, namely, that the state department would continue to encourage political dialogue between moscow and the chechen insurgents. nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the united states called upon the chechens to unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups, and that they accept putin's offer to make peace. if we view this warning against the background that putin's government has always seen usama bin ladin's hands behind chechen terrorism, we were witnessing a late recognition of moscow's views.
