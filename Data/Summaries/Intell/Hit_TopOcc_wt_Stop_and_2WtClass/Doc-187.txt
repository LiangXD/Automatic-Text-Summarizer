zanu pf readies for war by basildon peta special projects editor 10/18/01 9:43:45 pm (gmt +2) zimbabwe is amassing huge quantities of arms and ammunition using two african allies in preparation for next year's crucial presidential election, it has been established. financial gazette investigations in the past one-and-a-half months have revealed that the democratic republic of the congo (drc) and namibia are helping zimbabwe circumvent an international arms embargo to buy huge quantities of guns and bullets for next year's ballot. the investigations show that zimbabwe is importing and massing an assortment of guns at army bases around the country in preparation for the poll, which is expected to be violent. most of the guns have been arriving secretly at suri suri airbase in chegutu before they are distributed to other military bases and some will be sent to farms where self-styled war veterans have established bases to intimidate voters. the sources say zimbabwe, after the massive depletion of its armoury because of its participation in the three-year-old drc war, has been finding it extremely difficult to replenish its arms stocks because its traditional and cheaper arms suppliers in europe are refusing to sell it arms. we have been left with no alternative but to buy some weapons via our allies in the drc who have access to some of these european weapons that we have preference for. the first secretary at the namibian high commission in harare, mati jose, said he had no knowledge of namibia helping zimbabwe to bust the arms embargo while the drc's ambassador to zimbabwe mawapanga mwanananga could not be reached for comment.
