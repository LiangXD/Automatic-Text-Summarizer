it is there that 158 al qaeda/taliban prisoners are being detained because, depending on who you ask, it is an ideal, sunny clime, it's not subject to the get-out-of-jail escape hatches of u.s. federal law, or because, as one senior pentagon official says, the lawyers didn't want to go on 14-hour flights to some guano rock in the pacific. as we wait for our flight on a creaky pan am jet, we are shunted off to the vip room, so named because it has a coffee pot and seascape paintings that look pilfered from a south florida retirement village. sillier still were protestations from such humanitarians as saddam hussein and the government of malaysia (prime minister mahathir mohamad has made some of the loudest noise, though amnesty international dings him for arresting the speechwriter of a political rival, who was then blindfolded, stripped naked, punched, verbally abused, and forced to simulate homosexual acts--none of which is alleged at camp x-ray). likewise, when thousands of cuban rafters were detained here for months in the mid-'90s, many grew so unhappy with gitmo's ghostly desolation that they'd do anything to leave, including inject diesel fuel into their veins, drive tent stakes into their limbs, even swim back to castro's cuba. sitting on a bus on the tarmac, waiting for the secretary to emerge from his plane, we pass the time as journalists do, discussing the ap-style spelling of bin laden, speculating whether the prisoners will get an internet cafe (one of them has asked for video games), and making fun of the fresh-meat pentagon press corps, who are overdressed in heavy wools instead of our much cooler island linens. after rumsfeld tours camp x-ray with four senators and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, richard myers (who is so overshadowed by the secretary's rock star aura that one reporter has to ask who he is), rumsfeld meets the press on heartbreak ridge. still, the overseers of the prison are concerned that detainees aren't getting enough pita bread with their meals, and they're planning to make the food spicier, just the way the prisoners like it back home.
