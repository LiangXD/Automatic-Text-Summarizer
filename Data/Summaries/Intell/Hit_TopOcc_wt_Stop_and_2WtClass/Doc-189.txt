amman -- jordan, bound by environmental clauses in the free trade agreement (fta) with the us, is currently mulling over signing the kyoto protocol on global warming even though washington turned down the protocol six months ago. having clauses on the protection of environmental and labour rights in the body of the fta does not stop the government from signing environmental agreements refused by the us, according to minister of municipal and rural affairs and the environment abdul razzaq tbeishat. he announced the government's intentions to sign the kyoto treaty on sunday during a workshop on climate change, organised by the ministry and the united nations development programme (undp). in 1992, jordan signed the un climate change convention that compels nations to curb global warming, which is blamed on gases produced by factories and cars that burn fuel. the kyoto climate treaty is another international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. asked whether signing the kyoto protocol will affect jordan and us efforts to upgrade the kingdom's environmental framework, tbeishat said that signing the protocol will have a positive outcome on jordan. he explained that both the us and jordan have different issues to deal with on a national level, including environmental issues.
