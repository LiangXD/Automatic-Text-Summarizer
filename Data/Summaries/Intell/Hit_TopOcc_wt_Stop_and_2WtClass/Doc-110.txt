mdc leader tsvangirai at it again in south africa herald reporter opposition youths are agitating to get guns to shoot president mugabe out of office, mdc leader, mr morgan tsvangirai said in south africa yesterday. speaking in an address to the cape town press club, mr tsvangirai, who is on a visit to south africa, was quoted by reuters as saying he was having to rein in militants keen to fight president mugabe's rule. we are saying we will not resort to any violent overthrow or to any violent means, he was quoted as having said....you have people who are 20 years and 30 years (and) below who are asking if we can get guns and go and shoot the man out of office, but i say: please, that is the most dangerous thing you can ever do, he said. until such time as mugabe actually subverts the electoral process - when one goes to that extreme, international sanctions will be an option. mr tsvangirai might face charges of contravening the law and order maintenance act for allegedly threatening to violently remove president mugabe from power last year. if the supreme court rules in favour of mr tsvangirai, who if convicted on the charges might face life imprisonment, the attorney general's office will have to draw up a new charge. but anyone who wants to speak the language of violence where zimbabwe is concerned is playing with fire.
