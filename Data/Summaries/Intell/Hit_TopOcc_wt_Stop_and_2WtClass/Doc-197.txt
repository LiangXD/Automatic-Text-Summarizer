because of the misguided policies of argentina's politicians, argentina is in a state of stagnation for a fourth consecutive years. the important point is that argentina has enjoyed the imf's advice in the execution of these policies. what is clear is that argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today. although imf officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an imf executive delegation is actively making changes to argentina's economy. anyway, now in addition to the imf, the us government, as the biggest investor in argentina's economy, is ignoring its commitments in the current situation. however, there are a few ambiguous points, such as: 1 -- what amount of argentina's economic crisis is due to its relations with the global economy and how much effect will it have on the european and us economies due to its present stagnation? 2 -- what reaction is likely from other countries and international institutions to the government's new policies, for instance halting the payment of debts?
