the extent to which mugabe outmanoeuvred the west was made clear when southern african countries issued a surprise statement declaring the conduct of the election free and fair. the zimbabwe registrar-general, tobaiwa mudede, declared that mugabe had won a fifth term in office after the results from all 120 constituencies were returned. we find ourselves unable to endorse the purported election of president robert mugabe as zimbabwe's president in this election. the uk foreign secretary, jack straw, said: for months the government of zimbabwe has conducted a systematic campaign of violence and intimidation, designed to achieve an outcome - power at all costs. a senior state department official in washington later said: we're considering further steps, given all the things that happened before and during the elections. it is our considered view that the election was free and fair and reflects the wishes of the people of zimbabwe, namibia's observer team said in a statement, adding that the poll was watertight, without room for rigging. in zimbabwe the leadership of the congress of trade unions is considering calling a two-day general strike to test whether there would be popular support for a longer protest, and various civil rights groups are meeting today to discuss mass civil disobedience.
