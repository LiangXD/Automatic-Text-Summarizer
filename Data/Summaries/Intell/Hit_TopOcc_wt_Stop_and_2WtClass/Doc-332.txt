peronist to head argentina at least till march elections buenos aires - veteran peronist adolfo rodriguez saa was set to become the country's interim president yesterday, taking power after a devastating economic crisis toppled president fernando de la rua. a populist who has ruled a western arid province for 18 years, rodriguez saa will have to deal with an economy on the brink of defaulting on its $132 billion public debt and struggling with more than 18 percent unemployment. his appointment would restore argentina's largest party, the peronists, as the country's dominant political force after the most widespread social disturbances since the late 1980s, when a previous financial crisis rocked this south american country of 36 million. polls indicate that a majority of argentines support keeping the peg in place, despite increased calls from many economists and several political leaders that only a devaluation can help the economy rebound. argentines wary of surging unemployment, rising poverty, salary cuts and tax hikes are deeply skeptical of more calls for belt-tightening, the centerpiece of policies advocated by de la rua and his economy minister domingo cavallo. he complained that it was the peronists who forced him from office by disregarding his call to join a government of national unity - his last-ditch effort to remain in office after the declaration of a state of emergency failed to quell the rioting. rodriguez saa is reportedly considering easing banking restrictions imposed by de la rua, limiting to $1,000 the amount of money argentines can withdraw from their accounts.
