in discussing his decision, mr. marx suggested that it was time for someone else to oversee the government's negotiations with its creditors. in the last few weeks, working with the economy minister, domingo cavallo, mr. marx had been trying to persuade argentina's foreign creditors to accept lower interest rates on existing debts. depositors who worried that the peso's fixed one-to-one exchange rate with the dollar was about to be broken by a devaluation, despite mr. cavallo's insistence to the contrary, were withdrawing dollars from bank accounts. mr. marx kept his job through the resignation and replacement of two economy ministers, jose luis machinea and ricardo lopez-murphy, and the return of mr. cavallo to government. mr. marx is known for favoring market-based rather than regulatory solutions to economic problems, a reputation shared by julio dreizzen, who resigned as finance undersecretary on oct. on thursday, argentina's president, fernando de la rua met with carlos sa?nem, a former president and leader of the justicialists, to discuss economic strategy. the appointment of mr. kiguel to succeed mr. marx may be seen as a way to bring the justicialists into mr. de la rua's ruling coalition, forming a sort of national unity government to address the economy.
