when the imam (may god be satisfied with him) issued the fatwa against salman rushdie for insulting the prophet (peace be upon him) and the holy koran, the countries that are so-called supporters of human rights protested against the fatwa. they said it was an act of terrorism that was against international law and said it crushed human rights principles! it would therefore be appropriate for all islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the united states. if the european countries were honest in the withdrawal of their ambassadors from iran, blaming iran for violating human rights, then they should recall their ambassadors from the united states. after all the united states is not violating the rights of one human being, but many many human beings. it seems that following the blow that the americans received on september 11 in new york and washington, the united states is determined to take justice to pre-historic times. the united states thinks that it can silence the justice-seeking cries of the peoples of the world with the sound of explosions from 7-ton bombs and it thinks that it can justify its own inhuman behavior in the shadow of this noise.
