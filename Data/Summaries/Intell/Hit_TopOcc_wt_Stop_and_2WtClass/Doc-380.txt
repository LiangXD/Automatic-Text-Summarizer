desk tehran -- president robert mugabe easily won zimbabwe's election on wednesday despite biased propaganda unleashed against him by some western countries, accusing him of being unfair towards the opposition. canberra is a member of a three-nation commonwealth task force monitoring the election. tsvangirai, saying mugabe has destroyed the economy of the once prosperous nation, accused the president of systematically stealing the election to hide his deep unpopularity with voters, reuters reported. western countries queued up to condemn the election in which the 78-year-old president faced his first real challenge. the united states, condemning the reduction of polling stations in opposition urban strongholds, said the election was seriously flawed and riddled with irregularities. australia and britain led an unsuccessful call for commonwealth sanctions against mugabe before the election. new zealand said on wednesday it was ready to impose sanctions against zimbabwe if the commonwealth decided not to suspend the country after the vote.
