politics, not the environment, drives kyoto author: barry cooper and david bercuson the only winners in the increasingly heated debate over global warming are the boffins in ottawa. a couple of weeks ago, the federal government distributed a colourful announcement in newspapers across the land proclaiming that the earth is getting warmer and that implementing the 1997 kyoto protocol, on the targeted reduction of so-called greenhouse gases, would fix things. lorne taylor, the alberta environment minister, estimated the costs of kyoto to the canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year. he was alluding to the great money laundering operation whereby the federal government transfers cash from productive provinces such as alberta and dispenses it in places such as quebec. implementing kyoto would cost a paltry $500-million, he said, and added more ominously that the issue, technically, is that international relations fall within the purview of the federal government. historically, nearly all temperature data have been collected from urban heat islands and, as new zealand climatologist vincent gray observed, all measurements of global temperature that are made far from human habitation show no sign of any warming. in short, because the estimates of the scale and timing of atmospheric warming are so uncertain, it is just not possible to assess the costs and benefits.
