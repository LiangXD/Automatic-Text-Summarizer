this pledge is in addition to the pledges of individual eu member states that will be made separately at the conference, said gunnar wiegand, spokesman for external affairs commissioner chris patten. japanese ambassador to the eu takayuki kimura said his country had pledged 50 million dollars, in addition to technical assistance and another 10 million dollars to the whole of southeast europe, most of it to yugoslavia. johannes linn, world bank vice-president for europe and central asia, said the bank had pledged 150 million dollars for the current calendar year and over the next three years we expect to support yugoslavia to the tune of about 540 million us dollars in concessional loans. labus said milosevic's extradition is of course a part of the equation, but added broad economic reforms and democracy that we introduced into the country had played a major role. infrastructure, including power, water, rail and roads, he said, were suffering from many years of decay, mismanagement and the consequences of the nato 1999 bombing campaign that ended belgrade's repression of kosovo's ethnic albanian majority. a yugoslavia that has a firm and decisive program of economic reforms in place is and is increasingly integrated into the wider international community is no longer a dream, it is now a reality. the possibility of a democratic, stable and prosperous yugoslavia moving toward integration with europe is something which we dared not hope for only eight months ago.
