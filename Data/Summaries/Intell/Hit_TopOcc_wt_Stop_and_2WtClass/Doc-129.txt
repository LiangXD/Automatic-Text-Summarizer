in order to launch large stationary satellites, japan developed the h series rocket. it is supposed to be the next generation rocket that is both inexpensive and highly reliable. in addition to carrier rockets, japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies. in the field of satellite communications, japan's national space development agency (nasda) spent $310 million to develop the ets-8 (engineering test satellite 8) satellite. this program not only puts japan in the lead in providing new mobile communication services in the asia-pacific region, but also allows japan to test some new satellite communication techniques to be introduced worldwide. in addition, it also plans to develop 12 satellites, a new generation of unmanned space lab, a space station supply system, and a space shuttle in the next 5 years. they include a spy satellite, a data relay satellite to transfer data between satellites, an unmanned universe lab system, a test satellite for communications and broadcasting, an observation satellite for environmental protection, kibo the japanese experimental module of the space station and its supply system, and the h2a carrier rocket to launch all the spacecraft mentioned earlier.
