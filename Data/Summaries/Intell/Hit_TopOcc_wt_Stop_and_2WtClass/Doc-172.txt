brussels - new confidential documents indicate that current israeli prime minister ariel sharon and the army's former leadership were directly responsible for massacres in the palestinian refugee camps of sabra and shatila in 1982. on behalf of some palestinian survivors, lawyers luc walleyn and michael verhaeghe on 18 june filed a complaint with the brussels public prosecution office against sharon and other israeli and lebanese persons deemed responsible for the massacres in beirut. a few days after filing the complaint, the lawyers received a stack of documents in hebrew and in english regarding the 1982 israeli invasion of lebanon and the sabra and shatila events. judging from a few texts that de standaard was given access to, the documents seem to be related to the israeli kahan commission. it published a report, but not all the documents and interrogation reports were released, because they were deemed damaging to the state's interests. it had already been known that lebanese phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with israel, but according to the lawyers, various documents now indicate that israel and the phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance, that israel exercised complete control over the militias, and that, in the wake of the massacres, the israeli army instructed the phalange to assume responsibility. in the meantime, the lawyers have also initiated a civil suit against elie hobeika, the militia leader who is regarded as one of the main perpetrators of the massacres.
