dr. ren guoyu, an expert meteorologist at the national climate center of china, pointed out that the kyoto protocol was only the first step to resolve global warming during his interview with xinhua news agency. this excessive emission of greenhouse gases has caused the mean global temperature to rise by 0.4 to 0.8 degree c in the past 140 years. if emission of greenhouse gases is not rigorously limited and is allowed to continue to climb, then the average global temperature may surge by 1.5 to 5.8 c. in march, the new bush administration openly declared it would rescind its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol. the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by most developing nations in the past several decades only represents a small fraction of the total emission. to implement the kyoto protocol, according to dr. ren, usually a country would incur an economic loss equivalent to 1 percent of its gdp when it tries to lower greenhouse emissions 1 percent. during this conference, countries such as japan, russia, australia, and canada played the same tactic again to try to delay the implementation of the kyoto protocol.
