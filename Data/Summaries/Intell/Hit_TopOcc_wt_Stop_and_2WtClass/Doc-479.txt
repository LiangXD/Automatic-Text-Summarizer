the european parliament, which convened yesterday in strasbourg, decided to advise the 15 member states of the european union to impose economic sanctions on israel and, specifically, to suspend association agreements with jerusalem. for some time, european politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with israel -- a move, which in light of close and extensive trade relations between eu member states and israel, could cause serious damage. earlier this week, belgian foreign minister louis michel, who does not miss an opportunity to provoke israel, threatened that the eu would once again reconsider its relations with jerusalem. it takes more than a recommendation from the european parliament for this to happen the decision has to be taken by both the european commission and the eu's council of foreign ministers, on which all 15 foreign ministers sit, and has to be unanimous. israel will not change its positions on vital security issues, even if the european states eliminate customs breaks afforded to israeli exports. if the europeans wish to influence israel in the political arena -- in a direction that many in israel would support wholeheartedly -- they will not be able to promote their positions in such a manner. eu external affairs commissioner chris patten expressed this clearly tuesday when he said that canceling the association agreements between israel and the eu would do nothing to enhance jerusalem's readiness to listen to european representatives.
