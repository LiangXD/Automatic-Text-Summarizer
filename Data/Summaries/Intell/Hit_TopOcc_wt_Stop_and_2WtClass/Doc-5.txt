helen smith london 1996-08-20 in a theatre open to london's often rainy skies , a troupe of actors begins a risky experiment on wednesday to discover what william shakespeare's plays were like when first peformed 400 years ago. it is the realisation of the dream of american actor-director sam wanamaker , who died of cancer in 1993 , just as the theatre's wooden framework was being put in place. his vision is still central to the 30 million pound ( $46 million ) globe , which begins a _ prologue season _ on wednesday with a production of _ two gentlemen of verona. _ _ anyone who worked with sam was very much influenced by what he wanted to put together , _ said lennie james , who plays one of the _ two gentlemen. _ interviewed under grey skies in the globe's auditorium on tuesday , james said the place feels permeated with a sense of history. _ when ( artistic director mark rylance ) first welcomed us onto the stage saying we were the first actors in 400 years to stand here , i got a real buzz , _ he said. the globe has been carefully recreated from historical records and what could be gleaned from excavation of the original , destroyed in 1644 by england's puritan rulers. rylance said he hoped that working before a live audience would help show up anything the historians got wrong. _ we do not claim that this is it , _ said the boyish rylance. _ this is the best we can do in 1996. there_ 's bound to be more evidence and we look forward to it. _ notwithstanding his search for authenticity , rylance's production will depart drastically from shakespearian traditions. the cast of _ two gentlemen of verona _ will include women and black actors , both unheard of in shakespeare's day , and the play is set in modern italy.
