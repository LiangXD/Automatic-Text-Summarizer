Japan, U.S. Differ Over Global Warming Issues Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and visiting U.S. President George W. Bush differed over the Kyoto Protocol and how to prevent global warming but agreed to cooperate on that issue.The U.S. president announced an alternative proposal last week,calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies in accordance with economic growth instead of mandatory reduction targets presented in the Kyoto pact.Bush repeated his rejection of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol aimed atcurbing global warming, and pushed for the alternative he announced last week."It is for the U.S. to decide whether to take part in the protocol or not, but I hope we will continue with our efforts so we can move in the same direction," said Koizumi, who supports theKyoto Protocol.
