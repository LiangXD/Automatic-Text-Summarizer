But the snag is that first you have to be able to recover the GEMs to culture them to do the catechol yellowing test .There are so many bacteria everywhere that picking out a GEM is a_bit like looking for a candle amongst Blackpool '_ s illumination .Once you have the GEMs on the polystyrene spheres they can be washed off and cultured for testing with catechol or other techniques .are almost certainly the lost GEMs .The beads plus GEM are recovered with a magnet .Suspended in water , only the GEM for which the antibodies were specific will attach to the beads .is essential because_of the risks involved in letting GEMs out_of the laboratory .To develop a recovery method , Morgan , Saunders and Pickup used a Gem called Pseudomonas putida mt-2 , a modified common soil bacterium which may have wide applications for destroying toxic substances .could suddenly produce a GEM with some nasty trick up its sleeve .LOSING your favourite gems may be a personal disaster .by making a GEM both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ?So mt-2 '_ s purified pili and flagellae were injected into animals so that they rapidly produced antibodies specific to them .There are concerns that , once released , GEMs might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria .A second problem is that many bacteria living & bquo ; in the wild & equo ; are not always easy to culture in the laboratory .So_far , none are known to have been released in the UK .This GEM ?is one way .But losing GEMs could have much farther reaching implications .Using catechol is relatively simple and cheap .Engineering a time delayed & bquo ; lethal gene & equo ; into a GEM to give it a finite life ?Link: [Comments: zero anaphor of GEMS]not easy because any bacteria in it are much less abundant than , say in soil .is understandable .According_to the researchers , highly specific antibodies have ensured that the technique is a success .The gene is very uncommon in nature so any intense yellow colonies of bacteria isolated from the wild ?GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital .The researchers have devised a suite of methods based on detecting a marker gene engineered into the GEM .Their method has been designed for recovering a GEM from water ?
