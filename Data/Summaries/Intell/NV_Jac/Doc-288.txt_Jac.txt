Mugabe confident of victory in historic Zimbabwe vote HARARE-Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe predicted victory Saturday as he cast his ballots in presidential and local elections at a primary school in Harare's working-class suburb of Highfield.Tinkering has left voting procedures so confusing in Harare that even Mugabe and his top aides appeared unsure of where the president was to vote.Mugabe had to vote at that particular ward in order to be able to cast ballots both for president and for mayor in Harare, which is holding the two elections simultaneously.But it turned out the president would perform his civic duty instead at Kudzanai School, also in Highfield.
