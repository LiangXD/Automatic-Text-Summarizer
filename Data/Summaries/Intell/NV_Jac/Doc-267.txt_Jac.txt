Jim Unruh, Unisys's president, said he is approaching next year with caution.And Unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter.That, he said, is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business: It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to.That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said a month ago would be laid off.In addition, Unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $100 million during the quarter, leaving it within $100 million of its goal of a reduction of $500 million by the end of the year.Still, Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter, a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters.Unisys, whose revenue inched up 3.7% in the quarter to $2.35 billion from $2.27 billion in the year-earlier quarter, had an operating loss of about $30 million.So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $2 a share from $3.But the company said Friday that it had losses of $673.3 million through the first nine months, compared with earnings a year earlier of $382.2 million, or $2.22 a share fully diluted, as revenue inched up 1.4% to $7.13 billion from $7.03 billion.Unisys said that should help it save $500 million a year in costs, again at the high end of the previously reported range of $400 million to $500 million.
