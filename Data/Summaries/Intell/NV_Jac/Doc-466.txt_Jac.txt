The Israeli government is committing crimes of war against the Palestinians and should be tried by an international tribunal just like the governments of Rwanda and former Yugoslavia.We expect the World Community to take a step toward referring the Israeli criminals of war to the permanent tribunal for war crimes.This tribunal will be responsible for trying war criminals.
