It is not clear why the United States has not officially designated the detainees as prisoners of war, especially since Mr. Rumsfeld said they are essentially being treated as such.And yet, officials at Guantanamo have said that no interrogation has taken place on the base and that the prisoners do not have lawyers.The warden at Camp X-Ray, Col. Terry Carrico, said he was determined at all times to maintain what he called "positive control" over the prisoners.Critics said the United States was using sensory deprivation and other psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners so that interrogations would be more fruitful.Mr. Rumsfeld said one of the complicating factors was that the Geneva Conventions give protection to prisoners from countries but not from terrorist organizations, like Al Qaeda, to which some of the prisoners apparently belong.Amnesty International sought access to the prisoners in Guantanamo and said they should be allowed to have lawyers.Asked what benefit the United States gets by not classifying the captives as prisoners of war, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "I don't know enough of the legal technicalities to answer your question.Mr. Rumsfeld said the Pentagon's clear priority with the prisoners was to extract information from them to prevent future attacks.Several governments joined the chorus, saying the prisoners should be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention."I am telling you what I believe in every inch of my body to be the truth, and I have spent a lot of time on secure video with the people down there," he told reporters, referring to the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where 158 prisoners from the war in Afghanistan are being jailed.Officials have said the prisoners come from a range of countries, - Britain, Yemen, China, Saudi Arabia and Australia among them - and that has also complicated the legal picture.Mr. Rumsfeld said it was "probably unfortunate" that the photographs were released, at least without an explanation."I have grave doubts about whether I have jurisdiction," said the judge, A.The International Committee of the Red Cross, in a rare break with its code of not publicly criticizing detaining governments, said the United States might have violated Geneva Convention rules against making a spectacle of prisoners by distributing the pictures, which were published worldwide.
