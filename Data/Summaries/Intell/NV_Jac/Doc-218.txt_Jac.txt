Israeli's own 35-year-old occupation and resettlement policies have created the breeding ground for the terrorism that Sharon is now trying to root out by resorting exclusively to military means.Since Sharon refuses to offer the Palestinians their own state with acceptable borders and conditions, there are two alternatives left.Israel's resettlement policies have been justified on the grounds of security.Terrorism will not be absent from such a country and, in the process, Israel will lose the right to count itself among the world's democracies.Sharon, of course, will not admit that he is planning anything like this, even though the idea has been discussed in Israel.As Israeli tanks push their way into one Palestinian population center after another it has become more and more difficult to guess what political objectives might be driving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.The temporary security it may produce will be lost immediately if the troops are withdrawn.
