If the United States insisted that these prisoners are to be tried at a military tribunal, it is almost certain that they will be sentenced to death.The Detainees' Status -- an Issue Concerning Their Life and Death After visiting the Guantanamo prisoners' camp, many international organizations and media are accusing the United States of being too harsh for the prisoners.Now that these prisoners are in its hands, it is not likely that the US Government will let them off easily.Becoming a captive after being defeated in a war apparently is bad, but being not treated as a "prisoner of war [POW]" is even worse.What worries the West and some other countries most is that, if the United States refuses to treat these detainees as POWs, then their soldiers may be treated the same way as the Guantanamo prisoners should they be captured by the Taliban remnants and other radical organizations when they take part in the United Nations' peace-keeping missions.But people still question why the US Government refuses to characterize the detainees in Guantanamo as prisoners of war while claiming that the treatment for them is in line with the Geneva Convention on POWs.While these foods are strange to the prisoners, the United States has indeed abided by the dietary rules that Muslims have to follow.This is the first time in war history that "terrorists" have become war prisoners.When the prisoners are let out for exercise, take a bath, or go to the toilet, their hands must still be tied up, and two US soldiers will accompany them.Therefore, on the issue of defining these prisoners' "status," the United States must test the attitudes of the international community, especially the attitudes of European countries.The core issue is whether the Taliban and al-Qaeda members are "POWs" or "unlawful combatants."Reprisal against the prisoners of war shall be prohibited.Without a doubt, the United States' "willfulness" is what has greatly annoyed some countries and international organizations.These prisoners not only are citizens of the belligerent country, but also are citizens of nonbelligerent countries, even citizens of the United States' allies, such as Britain.If the above reports were true, then the treatment for the prisoners would be beyond reproach.The prisoners' hands and feet are shackled.If it chooses to characterize these detainees as POWs, then it must release some of them sooner or later and it is very likely that these people will again attack the United States with terrorist means.Because the prisoners have the dual identities being the enemies and the weaker parties, the US Government must not act as if it is venting its personal grudge against them while detaining them.The United States is one of the signatories.One thing the international community feels incomprehensible is that why are these Taliban and "al-Qaeda" members not considered as POWs since, before the war they were organized combatants, the battles they fought were also organized resistance, and they were obviously captured in battles during the war?Each prisoner is interned in a cell that is 2.5 square meters in size.A medium has this description for the Guantanamo prisoners' camp: The 2.5-square meter cement cell is way below the standards of cells built for American prisoners.Each Side Has a Different Story with Respect to the Treatment for POWs It is reported that the US Armed Forces are regarding the captives interned in Guantanamo as dangerous terrorists and Islamic Muslims.US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said that the Afghanistan's Taliban and "al-Qaeda" members are "unlawful combatants," not "POWs," and so the United States would not treat them as POWs and they would not enjoy any rights prescribed in the Geneva Convention on POWs.The prisoners, dressed in orange one-piece overall, are hand-cuffed.What appears does not seem to be what the United States wants, however.Certain American people also maintain that the US way of treating the prisoners is not reproachable.
