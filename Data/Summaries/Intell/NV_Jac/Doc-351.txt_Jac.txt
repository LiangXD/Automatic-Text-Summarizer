LONDON: British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Tuesday there was already "pretty strong" early evidence that President Robert Mugabe had "stolen" the election in Zimbabwe."If it becomes clear, and the evidence is already pretty strong, that President Mugabe, in the event he is declared the winner, has stolen the election, then that has enormous implications for the nature of our relationship with Zimbabwe," he warned.Counting in the election, in which Mugabe is battling for his political future against opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai after 22 years in power, began Tuesday amid complaints in Zimbabwe over the conduct of the vote.
