While I did not attend the trial--I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good.The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna Dear Joe, I know what you mean about being a journalist.Steve Ballmer, of course, is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft, but it still seems to be Bill's show over there.Now I am getting way too philosophical, but this is my final missive, so why not?The smart-boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully.Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories.I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era (probably decades and decades hence as it is too close).
