Yoo Choon-sik SEOUL 1997-03-31 South Korea on Monday raised the ceiling for foreign share-ownership by three percentage points , but analysts said they saw little short-term impact on the local stock market because_of poor fundamentals .But the Finance Ministry said it was considering further expanding the ceiling within this year .The ministry said it expected the increased ceiling to bring a further $3 billion into the market , but securities analysts estimated the fresh inflow of funds at between $500 million and $600 million .The Finance Ministry said it would raise the aggregate foreign ownership ceiling to 23 percent of a listed company from the current 20 percent , effective from May 1 .Therefore , I think the actual announcement will have a limited impact , _" Rhee said ."_ Foreigners are paying premiums over the counter for these shares , _" said Rhee .The government had earlier said a further three percentage point rise in the limit would take place in 1998 and 1999 , and the ceiling would be removed altogether in 2000 ."_ I do_ n't think foreigners will turn aggressive ( buyers ) unless the current account turns around , _" said Lee Keun-mo , head of research at ING-Baring Securities .Analysts said the country's growing current account deficit and the resulting depreciation of the won are the main factors discouraging foreign investment in local stocks .
