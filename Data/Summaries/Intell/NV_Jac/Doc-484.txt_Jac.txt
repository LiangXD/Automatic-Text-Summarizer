At the rear of the spaceship is the propulsion capsule to provide thrust to the spaceship in orbital control and return to earth.The spaceship is composed of three cylindrical capsules, with the orbiter capsule fitted on the forefront.In accordance with the plan, China's manned spaceship will conduct a series of scientific tests and earth observation after it is launched into space.For the next flight, the top of the spaceship's orbiter capsule may be installed with a docking module for docking tests between two spaceships.What exactly then is a manned spaceship?However, it is understood that China has successfully resolved this problem to provide sufficient power supply for its spaceship.Space technology will not only be used for civilian, but also for military purposes, and there is no exception for China.
