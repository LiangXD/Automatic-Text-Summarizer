It seems summer options aren't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes, so we're doing all we can to make Jameson available.All of our Six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity (and, truth be told, with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed in) and we have a waiting list of 60 children who are hoping to come if a spot should open.I hope you'll consider continuing your support of Jameson's special campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx.
