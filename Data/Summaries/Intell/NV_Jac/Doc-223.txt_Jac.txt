But the EU is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce US emissions.The Climate Change Convention of 1992, to which the US is a Party, requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels.While the intensity improvements may reduce this to around 33%, this is still a very substantial increase in absolute emissions.The "intensity target" proposed allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change.The EU is of the opinion that a cap-and-trade system is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions which combines a guaranteed environmental result with the flexibility to reduce emissions where it is least costly.
