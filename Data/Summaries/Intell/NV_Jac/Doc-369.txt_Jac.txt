In the last few weeks, working with the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, Mr. Marx had been trying to persuade Argentina's foreign creditors to accept lower interest rates on existing debts.In discussing his decision, Mr. Marx suggested that it was time for someone else to oversee the government's negotiations with its creditors.Mr. Marx became finance secretary in December 1999 after a career in private finance and a stint on the board of Argentina's central bank.Mr. Marx stepped down as Argentina paid $700 million in short-term debt owed to local banks by forcing pension funds to buy government bonds."I agreed to continue to work on the national debt issues for Argentina," he said.There was no doubt, however, that Mr. Marx's job had recently become tougher.Mr. Marx said that his foreign consultations had been proceeding "according to schedule."Mr. Marx kept his job through the resignation and replacement of two economy ministers, Jose Luis Machinea and Ricardo Lopez-Murphy, and the return of Mr. Cavallo to government.Mr. Marx added that he would still work with the government, in a capacity that had not yet been formalized.
