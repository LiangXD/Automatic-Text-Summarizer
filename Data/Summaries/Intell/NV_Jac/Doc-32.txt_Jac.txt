By Richard Longworth DIESEL engines are the most fuel efficient vehicle power source available .Trucks , buses and most taxis use them , and 40 per_cent of vehicle fuel sold in the UK last year was diesel .Diesel engine manufacturers have long maintained that these are harmless , but recently they have been found to contain polyaromatich hydrocarbons ( PAH ) , which can cause cancer when breathed deeply .Currently , diesel fuel sold in the EC contains 0.3 per_cent sulphur , except in West Germany where the level is 0.25 per_cent .There are also buses at_least 30 years_old still being run , so it is likely to be decades before the fleet is replaced .But diesel engines also have very dirty exhaust emissions .Some manufacturers such as MAN and DAF have solved the problem by fitting filters which clean themselves with a small furnace as the vehicle is in operation .These will be electronically controlled , a technical task far harder on a diesel engine than on its petrol counterpart .NOx be cut to 11.8g/Kw/hr , and particulates to 11.8 g/Kw/hr , That level will still be significantly higher than US levels , but much lower than vehicles currently being sold .It is small wonder that the truck and bus manufacturers based in areas hit worst by acid rain , Volvo and Scania in Sweden and MAN in Bavaria , are working hardest to cut pollutants .While not having the concentrations of poisonous gases found in petrol engine exhausts , they give out far more & bquo ; particulates & equo ; ( soot ) .The exhaust will also have to be fitted with filters to trap the particulates and their carcinogenic PAHs .
