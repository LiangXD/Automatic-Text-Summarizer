Partono said it was hard to make a fair valuation for Indocement because it could not be considered a pure cement stock or a pure food stock ."_ If we break up the value of Indocement into two divisions , cement and food , the cement business is undervalued , _" he said .But in 1997 and 1998 , its cement division should pick up due_to additional capacity , _" Partono said .Partono said he expected Indocement's cement division to imrove its performance in 1997 and 1998 due_to additional capacity from two new plants in West Java and Kalimantan .JAKARTA 1997-03-31 Net profits posted by Indocement , a major Indonesian cement manufacturer , in 1996 are above market estimates and installation of additional production capacity in 1997 and 1998 should keep the company in good stead , analysts said .Aside_from changes in the accounting method , he also said the stable growth of the company's food division at about 15 percent per year had contributed to earnings growth .However , Partono said the company had instituted changes in its accounting system in 1996 which partially accounted for the above-expectation earnings ."_ Growth of its cement division in 1996 was not too exciting as volume growth and price increases were relatively small .
