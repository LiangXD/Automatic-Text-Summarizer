The United States has not only made a procedural mistake, but the facts are incorrect, officials said.It has no right to issue such a false human rights report, experts said."The United Nations has held the high goal of protecting human rights," Jin said.It is heresy," said Cao.It shows that these so-called truths are not true at all," said Xirao-Nima.I have seen the truth there, which is very different from what some US politicians with ulterior motives have described," said Xirao-Nima, who is a Tibetan.The Italian senator's words are in sharp contrast to what was contained in the so-called China human rights report compiled by the United States, which blindly accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet."His behaviour has violated the Chinese law," said the Rev Cao Shengjie of the China Christian Council."The United States was slandering China again," said Xirao-Nima, a professor of Tibetan history at the Central University for Nationalities.But it nevertheless uses human rights issues to slander China," CSSHR President Zhou Jue said.The report said China should not have arrested Li, a Hong Kong businessman, who was charged with smuggling Bibles into the country in July."The United States has violated the UN spirit of not interfering in other countries' internal affairs," said Jin Yongjian, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations.Its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish China's image and exert political pressure on the Chinese Government, human rights experts said at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of Human Rights (CSSHR) on Friday.
