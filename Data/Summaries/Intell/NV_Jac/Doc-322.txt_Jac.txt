In short, because the estimates of the scale and timing of atmospheric warming are so uncertain, it is just not possible to assess the costs and benefits.The fact is, Kyoto is without principles and no one has a clue what it means.Lorne Taylor, the Alberta Environment Minister, estimated the costs of Kyoto to the Canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year.Taylor may have offered a more prudent guess, but the fact is, accurate estimates of the costs of policies designed to reduce selected gas emissions are impossible.Implementing Kyoto would cost a paltry $500-million, he said, and added more ominously that "the issue, technically, is that international relations fall within the purview of the federal government.Finally, vast uncertainty is built into computer models of climate change.The first, as the numbers tossed about by Taylor and Anderson indicate, is centred on costs of compliance.There are two levels to the controversy around Kyoto.According to Jean Chretien, "the desire of the federal government is to sign it."Swelling the population of envirocrats in Ottawa means that the sole beneficiary is the federal government.
