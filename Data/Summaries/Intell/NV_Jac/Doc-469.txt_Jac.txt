He also said that agreements with as many as nine foreign carriers across the globe had already been signed."The present rate cut of up to 40 percent on peak-time rates is likely to be lowered after Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) and the other ILD operators, who are yet to begin services, announce their rates.Carriers will now connect to Bharti's network and enjoy rates that will enable them to offer deep discounts to the end-consumer.As per the tariff plan announced by Bharti, peak-time call charges to the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] region will be offered at Rs 21.18 per minute as against the present Rs 21.82, while for the rest of the world it will be Rs 24 per minute as against Rs 31.30 to Rs 40 that are applicable now."Bharti, after requisite clearances, will offer its network to all carriers on a non-discriminatory basis.
