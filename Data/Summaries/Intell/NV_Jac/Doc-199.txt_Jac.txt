Through that, the United States can detain and try anybody who is not a US citizen and who is suspected of being a member of al-Qa'ida or of being involved in international terrorism in one way or another.The fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected.Many countries are parties to them, but the United States has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which US troops are taking part.Whenever there is a suspicion that a foreigner is involved in international terrorism, he will be arrested and imprisoned.Such a building enjoys the highest possible protection, and can and should never be the object of an attack, unless it is clearly established that it is being used for military purposes.Not in the United States alone are the screws being tightened.If it emerges that the person concerned cannot be removed from British territory because he is in serious danger in his own country, he can be detained almost indefinitely under this law.But the greatest attention is paid to the fate of the civilian population: In principle, the latter can never be the object of a military operation.Secretary Rumsfeld's statements (on 20 November 2001) that "the United States is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners," and that "my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the Northern Alliance)" also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters.Apart from the reasons or justification for such an action, all the combatants' war conduct must be constantly tested against the standards of international humanitarian law; that is, the rules which curb the use of force during a military operation.That al-Qa'ida terrorists and Taliban fighters are not very concerned about the human suffering that they have caused is also generally known.Hence guilt need not be established "beyond reasonable doubt," nor is there any mention of a presumption of innocence.In the media, the possibility of questioning presumed terrorists very roughly is also being considered aloud.The need for timely and accurate information about possible new attacks is naturally particularly great, but whether the global ban on torture can be abused on that account is another matter.It is stated in black and white that it is hardly feasible for these commissions to apply the normal principles of law and rules of evidence.
