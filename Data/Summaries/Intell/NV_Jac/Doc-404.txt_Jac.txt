Earlier on Wednesday, the US military resumed controversial flights of heavily guarded Al Qaeda and Taliban captives from Afghanistan to a naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a senior US official said.A total of 158 captives, whom the Pentagon has refused to classify as prisoners of war, are already being held and interrogated at Guantanamo amid criticism they have not been treated properly under the Geneva Convention.The official, who asked not to be identified, told newsmen that the first flight of captives in more than two weeks had left Afghanistan late on Wednesday and was to arrive at the isolated prison camp late on Thursday.None has yet been charged with a crime, but Washington has maintained that the prisoners are being treated humanely.And, "Al Qaeda is an international terrorist group and cannot be considered a state party to the Geneva Convention."It will not change their material life on a day-to-day basis: they will continue to be treated well because that's what the United States does," said Fleischer, who noted neither group would be granted prisoner of war status.
