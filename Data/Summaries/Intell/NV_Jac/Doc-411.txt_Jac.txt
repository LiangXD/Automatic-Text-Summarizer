At Goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day: A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients: "You can earn the money to support yourself and your family," she says.Just like the impact Goodwill's work has on our community.Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center, a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs.We don't waste time as we are helping the community.You and I know that solutions to difficult problems don't just happen.While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us.The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no time to waste.
