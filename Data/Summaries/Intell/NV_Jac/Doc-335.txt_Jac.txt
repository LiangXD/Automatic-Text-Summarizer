Van Laak said Russian space officials believe the soft bump that happens when Endeavour docks at other port on the station would not jar the Russian supply ship loose.Sensors and photos showed that debris about the width of a piece of string or wire is preventing a solid fit on the docking, said Jim Van Laak, NASA manager of operations and integration for the space station.NASA experts were worried that if the Russian supply vessel were not securely docked, it might jar loose and damage the space station."What we are concerned about is a wobbl ing" that could damage the locking mechanism, Van Laak said.
