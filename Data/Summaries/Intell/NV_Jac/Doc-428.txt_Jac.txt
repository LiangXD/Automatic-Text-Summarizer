The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clinton's marital problems a major campaign issue.Does she have any comment on whether Ms. Hanover plans to be Hillary Clinton's campaign manager?(One of the three is Kelsey's sister, whose motives can be similarly questioned; the other two heard Broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip, as only Kelsey and Broaddrick's husband claim to have.)But she did say in the interview, which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about Hillary Rodham Clinton's interest in the same New York Senate seat, that Mrs. Clinton is a 'very interesting' person.Hanover "would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate, whether she would like him to run for Senate, or whether she would campaign for him if he did.
