"_ It will not be long_before we can win a race with them . _" Hill's team also praised the Bridgestone tyres .Team manager John Walton said : "_ I think we could have gone the distance with these tyres and scored a good finish if it had not been for other problems . _" Villeneuve's victory , however , proved that the Canadian had the ability to produce strong racing even when things were tough and he was not running on the best tyres .Although Villeneuve dominated the twice-started race in his Goodyear-shod Williams , it was the performances of Panis , in a Bridgestone-tyred Prost , and Hill , in his much improved Arrows using Bridgestone rubber , which were most notable .But just as I expected , our tyres did not maintain their performance level over the whole race . _" I had a job getting past Hill as his tyres were still in top condition and this lost me a_lot_of time and probably cost me at_least one or two places . _" Even before the season began , Schumacher was warning former monopoly suppliers Goodyear that they needed to improve the tyres they supplied to the top teams if they were to resist the challenge from the newly-entered Japanese company Bridgestone .
