& bquo ; To a farmer it '_ s an anathema not to produce on his land and therefore it '_ s not that he is not being responsible in meeting the challenges . & equo ; Many farmers , it turns out , would n't in the least object to making the countryside ?There are various calculations about how much land is potentially redundant : it could be as many as three million acres .There is a Ministry proposal called & bquo ; extensification . & equo ; It means that the whole farm has to produce 20 per_cent less .There is a big fear in the hills that in_order_to maintain businesses in the lowlands , people will diversify into sheep , and the profitability of sheep in the lowlands will be greater . & equo ; In fact , the Countryside Commission has just announced an imaginative scheme for 12 & bquo ; community forests & equo ; on marginal urban fringe farmland .Conservationists , farmers and government agencies all agree that there is an opportunity right_now for debate and then decision .It is called & bquo ; set aside . & equo ; A proportion of the farm ?She goes on : & bquo ; The problem with taking a management decision out_of a farmer '_ s hands as an economic decision and putting it into conservationists hands is that the conservationists do n't always agree .It depends on what is defined as attractive .Or be allowed to go on growing ?& bquo ; In the future , it seems , we are going to be taking arbitrary decisions about what we want from the countryside : the large blue here , a certain bird there , and we are going to manage for those species , which will mean that everything_else will go . & equo ; The countryside may be changing .She says one fear is that land in the hills will become redundant . & bquo ; These are areas where you could say farming was marginal .Both the farmers and the conservationists agree that there ought_to be a debate .Either way , the countryside changes .Britain is over-producing : there will have to be some way of reducing output .Another problem is that the wildlife lobby is divided even over simple things like the future of old farm woodlands .But there is no debate , and any decisions are likely to be taken , piecemeal and by default .Unfortunately , even this wo n't be enough : the output figures from well-run organic farms are only between 6 and 12 per_cent below those from intensive estates .There are also emotional objections . & bquo ; We wish to see as many farmers as possible occupying the countryside , & equo ; said Melinda Appleby . & bquo ; We want to see a working countryside and we do n't want to see it fossilised so it '_ s almost like a theme park . & equo ; Farmers have higher hopes of the & bquo ; extensification & equo ; programme in the wings .One scheme is already in place .As profitablilty declines , they would go out_of farming .There is a nettle for a somebody ?there is a case for that too ?Some farmers are likely to achieve this by converting to organic farming .To a farmer it '_ s anathema not to produce on land .They also agree that a debate does n't seem to be taking place .Most will still be farming what they always farmed .THE British farmer is about to wander into fresh woods and pastures new .It will go on changing .Miss Melinda Appleby is environmental policy adviser to the National Farmers _' Union .So & bquo ; extended & equo ; farms will have to leave a wide strip of unsown soil in each field , and let the hedges grow .One of them is the geography of decline .The point is , that for the first time in decades , the environmentalists have a powerful voice ?
