Here is an interesting detail from his unpublished "Moscow speech" that was delivered to Chinese students studying in Russia.Shenzhou-1 was launched on November 20, 1999; it stayed in the orbit for about 24 hours, having orbited the Earth 14 times.China's three (unmanned) spaceships were launched into space from there:"A bit less than that," was the answer.China is also working on programs for Chinese cosmonauts to fly to the Moon, as well as a space station.That speech was delivered on November 15, 1957, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China authorized its rocket production program a year before that, in October of 1956 (on Mao Tse-tung's initiative).As China's experts believe, there should be at least four test unmanned flights performed before they can launch a man into space.However, it is evident now that China has reliable rocket systems; it has mastered the art of space navigation and soft landing of a spaceship.There was even an Austrian there, but the country who organized the forum, the third country on the rating of space explorers, was not represented.China will not agree to put its citizens on a foreign spaceship, as it must launch its own space vehicle from its own cosmodrome.At the same time, when the Chinese von Broun managed to reach China, there were other bearers of fresher secrets there from the country, which could "launch ambassador Liu Xiao into space."
