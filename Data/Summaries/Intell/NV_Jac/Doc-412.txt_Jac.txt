As it happens, the four countries cited, Colombia, Cuba, Panama and Nicaragua, are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left-wing politics.Over the past six months, six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas -- who often are one and the same -- in Colombia.The report charged that Panama's Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before.A final statement yesterday said: "While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere, the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship: death by assassination."<LU_ANNOTATE> The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing.They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war."1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere, repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever."The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions, but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today's editions.The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America, the United States, the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey, Mexico, this week.
