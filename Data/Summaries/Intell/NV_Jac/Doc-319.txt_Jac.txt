AFTER SPENDING months in frigid Afghanistan caves subsisting on Allah knows what, the 158 detainees the United States is holding in tropical Guantanamo Bay must think they've died and gone to heaven.It should be noted that much of the uproar is over photographs of the detainees taken as they were being transported from airplanes to their cells.Then there's the status of the detainees.Instead, Amnesty International and the comrades are outraged that the military is treating al Qaeda captives like prisoners.Yet, some Americans and Brits have been hollering about the U.S. treatment of these tough guys.Then there's the reporter who asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld if American Taliban John Walker will be treated the same as the detainees.You could understand the outrage if the U.S. military were torturing or otherwise mistreating the detainees.Amnesty International issued a press release accusing the United States of "keeping prisoners incommunicado, (using) sensory deprivation, the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them" in an effort to 'break' the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation."As for the "unnecessary restraint," one detainee has announced that he wants to kill an American before he leaves Cuba, and another detainee bit a guard, according to Pentagon spokesman Capt.Isn't the Taliban code all about sensory deprivation?
