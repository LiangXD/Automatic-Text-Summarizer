Those statues probably hadn't been a good likeness of him, anyway.It's been almost a year since the Taliban blew up those monumental 1,500-year-old sandstone statues in northcentral Afghanistan, at which time the only way for the rest of us to handle the insult to human sensibilities was to emulate the Gautama Buddha himself, and profess relief.So he is unlikely to have been enamoured of statues.Besides, those statues had been defaced long before they were finally reduced to rubble.Even at the time, though, this was a stretch for even the most ardent apologist.And so it has come ironically to pass that, one year on, a new Afghan order is dreaming of rebuilding those statues, while what's left of the Taliban now sits in cells a world away, beardless, bald and clad in saffron.Judging by its demeanour, the statue hadn't felt a thing.His clothes probably never looked quite like that - the statues' fashion sense had been clearly influenced by the Greeks, what with Alexander the Great having passed through on his way to giving up with India.The veil of compassion was hardly elastic enough to pull over those two great big holes in the earth.
