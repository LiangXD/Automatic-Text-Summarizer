yoo choon-sik seoul 1997-03-31 south korea on monday raised the ceiling for foreign share-ownership by three percentage points , but analysts said they saw little short-term impact on the local stock market because_of poor fundamentals. the finance ministry said it would raise the aggregate foreign ownership ceiling to 23 percent of a listed company from the current 20 percent , effective from may 1. most other firms would be ignored unless their economic fundamentals improved , they said. _ i do_ n't think foreigners will turn aggressive ( buyers ) unless the current account turns around , _ said lee keun-mo , head of research at ing-baring securities. _ i do_ n't expect much from the announcement. _ the ministry said it expected the increased ceiling to bring a further $3 billion into the market , but securities analysts estimated the fresh inflow of funds at between $500 million and $600 million. namuh rhee , head of research at dongbang peregrine securities , also played down the likely impact of the expanded ownership ceiling. _ most of the rebound we saw in the past couple of days reflected the expected increase in the foreign investment limit. the expansion of the ceiling was in line with south korea's earlier plan that called for a three-percentage-point increase by the end of this year. analysts said samsung electronics co , sk telecom co , pohang iron and steel co , kookmin bank and shinhan bank would benefit most from the increased ceiling. _ foreigners are paying premiums over the counter for these shares , _ said rhee. the aggregate foreign ownership ceiling on _ strategically important _ pohang iron and korea electric power corp will be raised to 18 percent from the current 15 percent.
