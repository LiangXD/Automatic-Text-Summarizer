new delhi, april 22 -- international call charges have finally started tumbling down, with bharti telesonic ltd -- the long-distance arm of the bharti group offering tariffs that are up to 40 percent lower than the existing rates. the present rate cut of up to 40 percent on peak-time rates is likely to be lowered after videsh sanchar nigam ltd (vsnl) and the other ild operators, who are yet to begin services, announce their rates. as per the tariff plan announced by bharti, peak-time call charges to the saarc [south asian association for regional cooperation] region will be offered at rs 21.18 per minute as against the present rs 21.82, while for the rest of the world it will be rs 24 per minute as against rs 31.30 to rs 40 that are applicable now. he also said that agreements with as many as nine foreign carriers across the globe had already been signed. these nine carriers account for 90 percent of the traffic coming to india. bharti, after requisite clearances, will offer its network to all carriers on a non-discriminatory basis. carriers will now connect to bharti's network and enjoy rates that will enable them to offer deep discounts to the end-consumer.
