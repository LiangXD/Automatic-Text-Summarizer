's agreement to acquire 51% of sansui electric co. proves that foreign companies can acquire japanese companies -- if the alternative for the japanese company is extinction. polly peck, a fast-growing british conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new shares of sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions. usually when a japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of sansui's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour. whether polly peck's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen, but at the news conference, mr. nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn sansui around. sansui, he said, is a perfect fit for polly peck's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an original equipment maker basis for sale under other companies' brand names. he said polly peck will greatly expand sansui's product line, using sansui's engineers to design the new products, and will move sansui's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into polly peck's own factories. and while polly peck isn't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of sansui, it is bringing in a former toshiba corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer.
