harare, march 17 (xinhua) -- despite western pressure on him over his re-election victory, zimbabwean president robert mugabe was sworn in on sunday as the country's head of state to serve another six-year term. mugabe, who is from the ruling zimbabwe african national union-patriotic front (zanu-pf), won last weekend's presidential election by polling 1,685,212 against his closest rival morgan tsvangirai of the movement for democratic change (mdc) who polled 1,262,401 votes. in the run-up to the march 9-11 poll, critics had accused the zimbabwean leader of stirring up the emotive land issue merely to garner support in the country's closest-fought election since independence in 1980. many african leaders have supported mugabe's re-election victory in zimbabwe's crucial election, which they said was transparent, credible, free and fair. in his campaign for re-election, the zimbabwean leader repeatedly accused britain and its western allies of trying to re-assert neocolonial rule in zimbabwe, and the region, by installing a compliant opposition party in power. however, mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity, incorporating his closest rival in the poll, to ensure political and economic stability in zimbabwe. diplomats here said a government of national unity was partly intended to allow britain and the united states to save face over their insistence on the mdc' s victory in zimbabwe's election.
