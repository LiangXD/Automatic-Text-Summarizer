this milestone puts japan's aerospace development program back on track. japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development. in the field of satellite communications, japan's national space development agency (nasda) spent $310 million to develop the ets-8 (engineering test satellite 8) satellite. in the past decade, despite its stagnating economy, japan has still put space exploration as a top priority item in its space program. the japanese aerospace industry has an ambitious plan to explore the planets. after two years of stalemate, the japanese government recently reorganized its aerospace development agency. they include a spy satellite, a data relay satellite to transfer data between satellites, an unmanned universe lab system, a test satellite for communications and broadcasting, an observation satellite for environmental protection, kibo the japanese experimental module of the space station and its supply system, and the h2a carrier rocket to launch all the spacecraft mentioned earlier.
