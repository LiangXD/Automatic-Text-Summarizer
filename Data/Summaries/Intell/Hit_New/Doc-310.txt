africa endorses mugabe victory, the west condemns it international reaction to the controversial re-election of zimbabwean president robert mugabe to another six year term varied widely. president daniel arap moi of kenya congratulated mugabe, calling his victory testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of zimbabwe hold in you. that position chimed closely with views expressed by the main zimbabwean monitoring group, the zimbabwe election support network which had 400 observers monitoring the poll and have been heavily critical. jack straw, the foreign secretary of the former colonial power, britain, which is locked in a verbal war with mugabe, said the zimbabwean head of state was bent on achieving one goal, power at all costs. bush's secretary of state, colin powell, earlier concluded: mr mugabe may claim victory, but not democratic legitimacy. the united nations' secretary-general, kofi annan, appealed for calm after the poll and urged zimbabweans to refrain from violence. mugabe's allies and detractors may all hope that he is spending the time reviewing the tense situation in the country and working out how best to calm fears and concern and rally zimbabweans together.
