bagram, afghanistan, dec 7 (afp) - in a foretaste of resistance to foreign peacekeepers by the northern alliance, an uneasy atmosphere reigns between us forces and their afghan allies at the bagram airbase north of kabul. once the main soviet airbase during moscow's 1979-89 invasion of afghanistan, bagram has now become the hub for flights into the country as kabul's own airport cannot be used because of unexploded us bombs. although northern alliance control the main entrance to the base, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of kabul, just inside the perimeter there is a checkpoint manned by heavily-armed us soldiers. but the ill-disciplined alliance troops showed little-disguised irritation at the americans' dominant role at bagram, refusing to allow journalists through to speak to the us soldiers. a group of journalists who toured bagram accompanied by us soldiers on wednesday were halted in their tracks by a burst of gunfire by alliance soldiers next to their vehicle. he said that northern alliance commanders were irritated by images of armed us soldiers on afghan soil, and so media access to the base had to be temporarily suspended. however northern alliance defence minister general mohammad qasim fahim said the same day that he had rebuffed a british offer to send troops to kabul in the coming days and insisted he wants a strictly limited un force.
