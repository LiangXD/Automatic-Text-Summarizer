russia disagrees with 'axis' remark munich, germany -- russia's defense minister said sunday that his country disagrees with the u.s. view of iraq, iran and north korea as an "axis of evil." italian defense minister antonio martino, meanwhile, said sunday that his country would not support an attack on iraq without "proven proof" that baghdad is supporting al qaeda, and iraqi leader saddam hussein dispatched a delegation to meet with european union leaders in spain. ivanov said the west uses a double standard in its definition of terrorism, asking why members of osama bin laden's al qaeda network are terrorists, but not chechen separatists fighting russia. "well, we don't like some of your allies like saudi arabia or gulf states who give finance to terrorism organizations," ivanov said. a diverse u.s delegation delivered a singular message to conference participants: nato remains vital and the united states needs a range of allies in the fight against terrorism and intends to consult its friends. sunday's final session also underscored the vast differences between the united states and russia. ivanov said there was no evidence belarus has sold arms to nations under sanction such as iraq, though it did do business with nations not under sanctions such as tajikistan, angola and "even gulf states."
