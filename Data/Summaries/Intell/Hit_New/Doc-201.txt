environmentalist groups staged a protest against the u.s. alternative to the kyoto protocol on curbing global warming near the u.s. embassy in tokyo on sunday prior to president george w. bush's arrival in the capital. protesters carried banners reading, ratify the kyoto protocol, and koizumi say 'no' to bush: stick to kyoto protocol. representatives of the ngos including kiko network, peace boat and foe japan handed a letter addressed to bush to a guard at the embassy. bush sparked international outcry when he rejected the kyoto protocol last march, saying it would mean sacrificing u.s. economic growth. we think this plan cannot be an 'alternative' to kyoto protocol because it would allow the current greenhouse gas emissions of the united states to increase by around 30% compared to 1990 level in 2010, the letter said. we demand of you, mr. president, to reconsider your climate policy plan immediately and re-enter the kyoto protocol. kiko network also sent an e-mail message to koizumi urging the premier to call on bush to return to the kyoto protocol at an early stage and to inform him of japan's plan to ratify the kyoto protocol after the diet approves ratification during the current diet session.
