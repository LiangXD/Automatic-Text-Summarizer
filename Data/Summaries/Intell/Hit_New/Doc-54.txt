we planted trees mainly in the major five areas that are severely endangered by sandy wind, said cai baojun, an official with the bureau in charge of forest planting. the shifting dunes in beijing's suburbs and rural areas have been successfully controlled by green barriers of trees and grass, which have also helped upgrade the city's forest proportion to 43 per cent, 23 percentage points higher than the nation's metropolitan average. by 2005, 50 per cent of beijing's land, including both urban and rural areas, will have been covered with trees. over the next 10 years, china will invest 6 billion yuan (us$720 million) to prevent sandstorms hitting beijing, according to sources from the state forestry administration. private organizations are also being encouraged to help fight sandstorms, according to the administration's vice-director li yucai. beijing was struck by sandstorms several times this spring. it is believed that sand from northern areas, especially the inner mongolia autonomous region, and floating dust from the city's uncovered construction sites are the main causes.
