govt dismisses us rights report government yesterday trashed a us human rights report which lists a number of human rights violations in namibia at the hands of security forces and government. the us government report on namibia's human rights practices for 2001, released this week, says members of the security forces committed several extra-judicial killings during security operations in the kavango and caprivi regions during 2001. during arrests and detentions, security force members reportedly tortured and beat citizens who were suspected of complicity with unita, the report says. the report says even though the namibian constitution provided that people arrested must be informed of the reason for their arrest and be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours of their detention, this has not been the case. shivute said namibia attached little value to the latest us rights report as it carried a lot of factual inaccuracies and was a mere reproduction of unverified and unsubstantiated reports. he said the report, for instance, claimed that the swapo publication namibia today, the ruling party paper, was a government-owned magazine. shivute also said the report carried a total confusion of historical data by claiming that the national union of namibian workers (nunw) was no longer affiliated to the swapo party.
