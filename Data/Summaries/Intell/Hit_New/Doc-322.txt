politics, not the environment, drives kyoto author: barry cooper and david bercuson the only winners in the increasingly heated debate over global warming are the boffins in ottawa. a couple of weeks ago, the federal government distributed a colourful announcement in newspapers across the land proclaiming that the earth is getting warmer and that implementing the 1997 kyoto protocol, on the targeted reduction of so-called greenhouse gases, would fix things. ten days ago, when asked about kyoto at the now famous team canada press conference in moscow, premier ralph klein produced a letter indicating that all the premiers, except the ever-distinct quebec, opposed kyoto. a few days later in munich, provincial opposition was hedged with qualifications: the ndp premiers of saskatchewan and manitoba apparently thought the principles of kyoto were fine. herb dhaliwal, the federal energy minister, weighed in with even more qualifications: some important details have to be worked out before canada ratifies the kyoto protocol, he said. lorne taylor, the alberta environment minister, estimated the costs of kyoto to the canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year. he was alluding to the great money laundering operation whereby the federal government transfers cash from productive provinces such as alberta and dispenses it in places such as quebec.
