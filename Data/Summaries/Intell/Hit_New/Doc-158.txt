introducing the currency board system in 1991 obliged the central bank to guarantee the pesos in circulation with foreign currency reserves, in the same way as issuing bodies used to only issue notes to the equivalent of the gold reserves they held. michael mussa, chief economist with the imf until last april, recognizes this: if we had paid more attention to the growing budgetary deficit and national debt between 1996 and 1998, argentina would have been in a much better position to absorb the impact of the devaluation of the brazilian real. argentine pension funds have enjoyed interest rates as high as 35 percent over recent months: no less than 45 percent of the national debt estimated at between $130 and $150 billion is held by the argentines themselves. at the same time private debtors who became indebted in a strong currency would find themselves ruined by a peso devaluation. the final switch to the dollar would stabilize relations between creditors and debtors. but neither dollarization nor the currency board provides a guarantee of low interest rates, as there will always be an argentine risk. that leaves the most economically realistic solution, the one backed by the technical experts: floating the currency, but it is also the most risky.
