mr. chavez, 47, a firebrand populist who had said he would remake venezuela to benefit the poor, was obligated to resign in a meeting with three military officers about 3 a.m. today after large street protests on thursday in which at least 14 people were killed by gunmen identified as his supporters. the interim government quickly moved to undo mr. chavez's policies, dissolving the national assembly controlled by his supporters, firing members of the supreme court and changing the country's official name back to the republic of venezuela. while pledging to hold presidential elections within 365 days, officials said that mr. carmona, who had been a leader in the protest movement against mr. chavez, will not be able to run. mr. chavez had fired mr. lameda in february and appointed a left-leaning ally in his place along with five board members close to his government, enraging thousands of office workers at the company. the interim government today ended mr. chavez's policy of offering oil to cuba under terms favorable to havana. american officials praised the venezuelan military and the police for defying mr. chavez, as well as television stations and other media outlets that continued to function despite government orders to shut down. among mr. carmona's most pressing tasks now will be to assuage concerns in other countries about how mr. chavez's reign ended and deal with the polarization between rich and poor that divides this country, analysts familiar with venezuela said.
