mr. mugabe, zimbabwe's leader for all its 22 years of independence, won a fifth term in office yesterday, defeating his opponent morgan tsvangirai in an election marred by violence, intimidation and the manipulation of electoral laws. according the registrar-general's office, mr. mugabe received 56% of the 3.1 million votes cast to mr. tsvangirai's 41%. the win gives the 78-year-old mr. mugabe a six-year term in office and was hailed by patrick chinamasa, zimbabwe's justice minister, as a runaway victory. mr. chretien, who this month headed off a move to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth in advance of the vote, said the election of mr. mugabe does not look very good but insisted canada must wait for the results of a commonwealth report before acting. mr. tsvangirai seemed at a loss over what to do next, saying that the leadership of his movement for democratic change (mdc) would have to meet to come up with a strategy to counter mr. mugabe's victory. the mdc says the disorganization in harare was planned by mr. mugabe in order to disenfranchise mr. tsvangirai's supporters. according to the government, as few as 42% of harare's 800,000 voters cast their ballots while the rate of participation in mr. mugabe's rural strongholds approached 69%, a figure disputed by the mdc.
