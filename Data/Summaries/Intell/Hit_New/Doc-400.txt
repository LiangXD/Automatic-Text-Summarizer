washington: unprecedented scepticism and scorn accompanied the release by the united states on monday of its annual human rights report amid charges of hypocrisy and double standards arising from the ongoing war on terrorism. washington's kid glove treatment of its so-called allies such as saudi arabia and pakistan came up for withering scrutiny at a briefing to release the 2001 country reports on human rights practices, an annual administrative exercise mandated by the congress that many feel has increasingly become a meaningless ritual. the individual country reports is a compendium of alleged human rights violations culled from various sources, mostly the local media. critics in the media sharply questioned such duplicity at monday's briefing as lorne cramer, us assistant secretary for democracy, human rights, and labour, struggled to defend american policy. with the demise of the taliban, there is arguably no government in the world that has as bad a human rights record as saudi arabia does. what is the united states doing to actively promote democracy and human rights with saudi arabia? q: because other administrations told us that they've talked to the saudis about human rights and democracy issues, participation in women's rights and all of it.
