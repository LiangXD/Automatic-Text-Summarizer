eugene moosa tokyo 1997-03-31 japanese prime minister ryutaro hashimoto , moving to tackle his biggest political problem , vowed on monday to push through legislation to extend land leases for u.s. military bases beyond a may deadline. the new legislation will , in effect , give the japanese government a temporary extension of its leases on land occupied by the u.s. bases after the current contracts expire. hashimoto faces a may 14 deadline on the leases on land owned by some 3,000 people on japan's southern okinawa island , who are refusing to renew the contracts. the case is now before an okinawan land expropriation committee , whose decision to renew leases was not expected before the may deadline because_of a lengthy hearing process. hashimoto is expected to visit washington in late april for talks with clinton. _ at the u.s.-japan summit talks , i have no intention of seeking the reduction or withdrawal of u.s. troops , including the marines ( on okinawa ) , _ hashimoto said. private land for u.s. bases is expropriated by the japanese government , not the u.s. military itself. local authorities on okinawa , where about half of the 40,000 u.s. troops in japan are stationed , want the bases closed by 2015 but tokyo strongly opposes such a move.
