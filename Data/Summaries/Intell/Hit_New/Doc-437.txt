for the past three years, mccoy has been actively engaged in accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others: youth service providers, youth, funding bodies, and interested citizens to name a few. the formation of the community academy, a pilot project directed at expelled students from local school systems, has come about as a result of mccoy's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response to a pressing issue. one concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the united northwest area in partnership with the junior league of indianapolis and community partnerships with youth from fort wayne, indiana. since its re-organization, mccoy has established its unique niche within the community by refraining from direct service programming and focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs, and moving toward collaborative solutions. mccoy invites the support of the __ company foundation in the amount of $10,000.00 to support such activities as: ---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhood-based youth councils ---- the promotion of youth employment opportunities ---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery ---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youth-adult relationships ---- the development of community-wide supports for the positive growth of all marion county young people. in the last several years, the business and corporate community has recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to the development of a competent workforce. in our fund raising efforts to date, we have received the support of local government, foundations, and corporations as well as the personal financial commitments of individual mccoy board members.
