marshall schwarz was named chairman and chief executive officer of u.s. trust corp., a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $17 billion. mr. schwarz, who is president of u.s. trust will be succeeded in that post by jeffrey s. maurer, 42, who is executive vice president in charge of the company's asset-management group. but mr. schwarz welcomes the competition in u.s. trust's flagship businesses, calling it flattery. the new services allow u.s. trust to cater to the new wealth, mr. schwarz says. we will have a reasonably flat year this year, mr. schwarz says. mr. schwarz also said costs associated with u.s. trust's planned move to midtown manhattan from wall street will continue to be a drag on earnings through 1990. mr. schwarz's father was a u.s. trust trustee until 1974.
