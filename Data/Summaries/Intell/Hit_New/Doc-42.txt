risa maeda tokyo 1997-03-31 the bank of japan ( boj ) may continue to let japanese short-term money rates to fluctuate widely after april 1 to remind the market of the risk of relying too much on overnight money , analysts said on monday. but analysts and bankers said the convenience financial firms now find in the quasi-fixed overnight money may sooner of later be replaced by risk. the rate was at 0.53 percent on the previous day. _ by allowing the key overnight rate to rise sharply , the boj at that time let market participants know that they should take a liquidity risk as long as they rely on the overnight money , _ said shoji kitta , president of totan research co. _ also , if the boj leaves the current upward bias in the key overnight rate after april , which is highly likely , that may encourage banks to use longer-term transactions and lessen settlement risks in trading overnight money , _ he said. but the key overnight rate was boosted to 0.85 percent by some banks which were in great need of overnight money after failing to raise enough longer-term funds covering the fiscal year-end , bankers said. the central bank has since december gathered ideas from the financial institutions based in tokyo on the rtgs system , in which transactions are settled instantly on a real-time basis through the accounts that they have at the boj. but once any defaults , all transactions would need to be halted , paralysing the entire system. _ once banks do have concerns about liquidity risk , they should raise more longer-term funds. they also need to increase collateral to enable them to raise funds from the market because that is likely to be required under the rtgs system , _ said a senior official at a major city bank. $-- tokyo treasury desk +81-33432-8570
