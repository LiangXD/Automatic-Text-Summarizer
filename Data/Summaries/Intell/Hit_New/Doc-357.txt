across from sears is camp x-ray, a teeming hive of concertina wire, canvas tents, guard towers, and newly constructed plywood interrogation shacks with window-unit air conditioners. the chain-link cells themselves don't need air conditioning, since a comfortable caribbean breeze (temperatures range from the low 70s at night to the low 80s during the day) continuously circulates through the encampment. and while american prisoners in the hanoi hilton often spent years in solitary confinement and received no medical care (john mccain to this day can't comb his own hair), x-ray detainees get daily sick calls from all manner of doctors, from optometrists to podiatrists. while public affairs officers these days are going to great lengths to talk about how docile the prisoners are, detainees have been reported biting a guard, spitting, and threatening to kill americans. many organizations who haven't been to gitmo, like human rights watch, have been extremely critical of the prisoners' treatment, while the icrc has aired no complaints. after rumsfeld tours camp x-ray with four senators and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, richard myers (who is so overshadowed by the secretary's rock star aura that one reporter has to ask who he is), rumsfeld meets the press on heartbreak ridge. while he remains as firm as ever that the detainees are illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, which would afford them more rights under the geneva convention, he nicely avoids plucking the only hair worth splitting--whether the captives' status is his call.
