to be fair, so far as truth can be discerned from polls, the free western world is indeed grateful, and on balance quite supportive of the cause the americans are leading. this man, who advanced a mendacious critique of orientalism, is himself a product of the scholarship he demeaned and is able to command audiences in egypt and elsewhere in the middle east because of his success in america. and while the conventional and verbal anti-americanism is in a different league from the terrorist strikes -- closer to hypocrisy than to murderous hatred -- i think the two are animated by a common cause: a cause to be sought in the murk of the individual human soul, not in the externals of political argument. in the column i wrote on the very day of the september catastrophe, i touched upon the envy of america, which i believed to be its root cause. ( yes, that was horrible... but we have to realize why the americans are so hated. ) it was no surprise to me, though a surprise to others, to find both right-wing tabloids and left-wing pundits joining the fray in europe over what i have come to call, facetiously, the gitmo gandhis to see the speed with which even mildly conservative fellow-canadians jumped to the conclusion that the united states was mistreating its hostages, and wilfully ignoring geneva conventions that few had ever read. for while the left has compounded anti-americanism into dogma, the right in canada, europe and beyond, participates in the envy of u.s. success. let me pause only briefly to allow that america is imperfect, like all earthly things that its governments and people have committed many sins that might does not make right that power and wealth are not good in themselves that goodness, truth and beauty may be found in every country and town.
