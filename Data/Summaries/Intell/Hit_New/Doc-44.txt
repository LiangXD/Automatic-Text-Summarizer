jakarta 1997-03-31 net profits posted by indocement , a major indonesian cement manufacturer , in 1996 are above market estimates and installation of additional production capacity in 1997 and 1998 should keep the company in good stead , analysts said. pt indocement tunggal prakarsa announced it booked a net profit of 551.49 billion rupiah in 1996. analysts said the market consensus for the figure was 549.4 billion rupiah. _ the ( net profit ) result of indocement for 1996 is slightly above our expectations of about 523 billion rupiah , _ stephanus partono , an analyst at goldman sachs in singapore , told reuters. partono said he expected indocement's cement division to improve its performance in 1997 and 1998 due_to additional capacity from two new plants in west java and kalimantan. partono said indofood's new west java plant , with an annual capacity of 1.3 million tonnes , would start operations in april while the one in kalimantan , with an annual capacity of 2.4 million tonnes , would start operations in august 1998. _ growth of its cement division in 1996 was not too exciting as volume growth and price increases were relatively small. however , partono said he expected indocement to perform only in line with the broader market and not exceed it. _ if we break up the value of indocement into two divisions , cement and food , the cement business is undervalued , _ he said. partono said it was hard to make a fair valuation for indocement because it could not be considered a pure cement stock or a pure food stock.
