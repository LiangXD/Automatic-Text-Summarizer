guantanamo to hold terror prisoners the u.s. naval base at guantamano bay, cuba, once a detention center for thousands of cubans and haitians seeking freedom in america, may soon become a prison for men with a radically different view of the country. ileana ros-lehtinen, r-miami, said she supported the idea, in part, because it would underscore the naval base's strategic importance at a time when some members of congress have urged returning the territory to cuba. because the base is not on u.s. soil, people detained there are not entitled to american residency and eventual citizenship privileges. during the 1994-95 rafter crisis, 50,000 cubans and haitians were housed there in a tent encampment after u.s. naval vessels had picked them up at sea. 1999 plans at the southern command in miami, the pentagon's base for military operations in latin america and the caribbean, spokesman steve lucas said planners had pulled out blueprints from april 1999 -- when the clinton administration had briefly considered housing up to 20,000 refugees from the kosovo conflict at the base. there is also a gate between cuba proper and the base that is sometimes opened for meetings between military commanders, or to repatriate cubans who have been taken to the base. cuban leader fidel castro has long argued that the u.s. military occupation of the base is illegal, while u.s. officials say the base exists under a lease agreement that was part of a 1934 treaty with cuba.
