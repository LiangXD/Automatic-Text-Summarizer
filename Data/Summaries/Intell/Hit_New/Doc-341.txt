africa's grand bargain all was not lost in zimbabwe's rigged election last week. africa's two richest and most powerful nations, south africa and nigeria, decided to punish zimbabwe on tuesday for a flawed presidential vote. this grand bargain to uplift the world's poorest continent would have been in jeopardy if thabo mbeki, south africa's president, and olusegun obasanjo, nigeria's president, had not agreed to suspend zimbabwe from the 54-nation group of former british colonies known as the commonwealth. mbeki and other african leaders need to press mr. mugabe to stop his repression and to not take farmland from whites without just compensation. such desperation by mugabe should not be condoned by african leaders. south africa's leader, mbeki, who has been inclined toward quiet diplomacy with zimbabwe, has now made himself heard. his stature in africa and his stand on zimbabwe's future bring hope for african economic renewal and greater democracy. back to top untitled copyright @ 2002 the christian science monitor.
