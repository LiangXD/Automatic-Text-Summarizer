that world which had looked in tears at the photos and the pictures of september 11, the towers collapsing, and the infamy against civilization, and which is now discovering these other photos, the first ones to come out of camp x-ray, the open-air prison which the united states has set up at guantanamo base, their historic outpost on the island of cuba. one hundred and forty-four is the number, so far, of prisoners captured in the 100 days of the afghanistan war, and taken here from kandahar air base on a 27-hour flight, blindfolded, gagged, tied up, and dosed up with sedatives on the c17 cargo planes belonging to the stars and stripes air force. but the photos of 'gitmo' are now in danger of removing the united states from the niche of affection and solidarity which september 11 had guaranteed it in the hearts of many people. outside the camp, there lies the absurd small piece of the united states which is guanatanamo on cuban soil: a mcdonald's outlet, the school with its yellow bus for the children of families living on the base, the store windows with the latest roller-blades at 50 dollars, and the cinema, currently showing 'domestic disturbance.' and, around this small piece of the united states, the cuba of old man castro, who up until now has not batted an eyelid, and has renounced using the scandal of x-ray and attacking the 'hated yankees' with his propaganda, relying on the possible end of the embargo against his regime. it is a clash of civilizations, and it is perhaps about to become the first global prison in the new world: yesterday stockholm announced that in a cage of guantanamo there is a swedish citizen, while the next ones due to arrive are six algerians, who have nothing to do with the war in afghanistan, and who were arrested in bosnia on a tip-off from the us secret services, because they are suspected of preparing an attack against the us embassy in sarajevo (one of them is said to have phoned a member of al-qa'ida). morton haplerin, from the council for foreign relations, said: it is clear that the united states sees guantanamo as a place where it can gather persons caught in all parts of the world.
