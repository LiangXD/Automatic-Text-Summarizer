the european parliament, which convened yesterday in strasbourg, decided to advise the 15 member states of the european union to impose economic sanctions on israel and, specifically, to suspend association agreements with jerusalem. for some time, european politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with israel -- a move, which in light of close and extensive trade relations between eu member states and israel, could cause serious damage. earlier this week, belgian foreign minister louis michel, who does not miss an opportunity to provoke israel, threatened that the eu would once again reconsider its relations with jerusalem. european commission president romano prodi expressed similar sentiments: in his opinion, the eu should consider imposing an economic punishment on israel in protest against the operations of the israel defense forces in the territories. the same goes for spanish foreign minister josep pique, who was offended after israel refused to allow him and eu foreign policy chief javier solana to meet with pa chairman yasser arafat in ramallah. the europeans know that repeated denunciations of israel, not to mention its punishment, will not lead to a solution of the conflict. eu external affairs commissioner chris patten expressed this clearly tuesday when he said that canceling the association agreements between israel and the eu would do nothing to enhance jerusalem's readiness to listen to european representatives.
