november 27, 1995 dear friend: what kind of people benefit by your contribution to pleasant run children's homes? families are being torn apart, and too often, children are the victims. pleasant run children's homes began serving children nearly 130 years ago. then the task was to help children who lost parents in the civil war. in 1994 pleasant run served 346 children and 125 families. the children and families who come to pleasant run are given the opportunity to become happy, loving, and productive members of our society. for pleasant run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families, we need your support.
