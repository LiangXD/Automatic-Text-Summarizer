canadarm2 lays track for space railway subhead: 'a unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment': improved mobility author: broward liston cape canaveral, fla. - the first railway in outer space was ready to roll yesterday after astronauts from the space shuttle atlantis prepped it for its inaugural run. the rail car is part of the 13-metre-long s-0 truss, the centerpiece of what is to be a 120-metre girder running the length of the space station. in a spacewalk lasting more than six hours, astronauts steve smith and rex walheim, the same team that mounted the new truss segment on to the station last thursday, released launch restraints on the rail car, which rode to space in the shuttle's cargo bay. captain marc garneau, president of the canadian space agency, said canadarm2 has so far performed flawlessly in its pivotal role installing the truss segment. the massive robotic arm, canada's contribution to the multi-national space station, lifted the truss segment out and away from the shuttle's cargo bay and attached it on the station's laboratory module. the arm was then used for the first time to move the spacewalking astronauts to different work sites around the newly installed truss. the 18-metre arm, which is powerful enough to lift entire station modules, was also rewired so it could draw power through the s-0 truss.
