china's minister in charge of taiwan affairs says beijing will not resort to force to defend taiwan despite the changing situation on the island, which he described as our renegade province. wang yi, who made a three-day working visit to thailand last week, sought to allay fears amongst allies in asia about its cross-straits ties with taiwan. he said beijing will maintain its pursuit of peaceful unification with taiwan and welcomed the resumption of dialogue, bogged down since 1999. he said the number of thai politicians visiting taiwan, especially members of parliament, was increasing at an unusual rate. we disapproved of these visits because no matter in what capacity these people travel, taiwan treats them as official visits. wang said beijing raised no objections to the so-called stop-over tactic used by taiwanese leaders as long as the visits do not generate political activities in the host country. last year there were 2.85 million taiwanese visitors in china, he said.
