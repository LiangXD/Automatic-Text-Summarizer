mmm f_name l_name title company address city,st zip march 4, 1999 dear ltr_name: cci has come a long way in the last five years. it's clear that if we don't increase our base of private funding, we won't have the kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers and the very important services they offer. where else would that many people turn if cci weren't there to help? where else would that many people turn if cci weren't there to help? this way when we go out to ask for community support and are asked about our board giving level, we can show our in-house commitment through 100% board participation. your financial support of the development process is just one step in making cci a stronger, more efficient and ultimately more effective federation of service providers. sincerely, j.chris graffeo chair p.s. if you have any questions, feel free to call valery de long at cci, 638-3360 x23.
