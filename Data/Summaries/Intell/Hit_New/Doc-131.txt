the scenes of destruction reminded the palestinian people of the ongoing devastation and the palestinians who are falling victim to the israeli acts of bombardment, targeted assassinations, and incursions into palestinian towns and villages, including bayt jala, gaza, khan yunus, rafah, janin, tulkarm, ramlallah, jericho, nabulus, and others. nobody who has a live conscience and human feelings, whether he is palestinian or otherwise, could not have been moved by these events and expressed sympathy for the families of the us victims, regardless of the us political stances that are totally biased to israel and israel's use of the most advanced us weapons to curb the palestinian intifadah. this is because the palestinians were, and still are, hoping that the americans would realize, if they have not already realized, the justice of the palestinian cause and the enormous injustice suffered by the palestinians, who were expelled from their homeland, whose land was occupied, and who were deprived of the minimum political and human rights. these people saw the majority of their security sites destroyed and the residential neighborhoods and apartment buildings parallel to the combat lines with the israeli army and settlements in the west bank and gaza targeted by the apaches helicopters and large-caliber artillery and machine guns. this is because israel is an occupation state, one that is persecuting the palestinians and denying them the right to exercise their national and sovereign rights. while the world is busy following the news of the attacks on the us targets and feeling sorry for these acts, israel carried out an incursion into janin and the neighboring villages, bombarded more palestinian internal security sites, demolished more homes in east jerusalem, and killed an additional number of palestinian activists and non-activists, including an 11-year-old girl. what is required of israel is to withdraw, both on the military and settlement fronts, from the territories occupied in 1967, and the united states should push its ally israel in that direction.
