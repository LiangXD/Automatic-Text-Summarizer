on thursday [29 november] the belgian government formally committed itself, vis-a-vis its russian and european partners (the european space agency [esa]), to pay frank de winne's ticket into space. the formal agreement regarding frank de winne's flight with the russians was signed in brussels on thursday by charles picque, the minister for science policy, and his government commissioner yvan ylieff. the document, a letter sent to both the esa (european space agency, to which frank de winne currently reports) and the russian rosaviacosmos space agency, guaranteed the payment by belgium of the expenses tied to this space trip. so, if that should prove necessary, de winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship. in brussels on wednesday [28 november], the french astronaut claudie haignere, who had just completed a flight in space together with the russians that in every way was identical to the one scheduled for de winne, could not find enough praise for our fellow citizen, with whom she trained for several months in moscow. de winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting. de winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting.
