apart from criticizing the axis of evil countries for abusing human rights, it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti-terrorist alliance. consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overshadowing concerns about human rights. the human rights report poses a substantial challenge to the us interpretation of good and evil. the report expressly points out that, it is extremely easy for terrorists to find supporters in countries where human rights are not respected and where individual freedom is repressed. to prove that human rights are important ammunition in the battle against terror, then, the us must attack terrorism to make human rights matter to these countries. if, however, us president george w. bush still believes in the supremacy of human rights, he must not forget the breeding ground for terrorists that exists within the anti-terrorist alliance. if the us, which claims to be the world's policeman, is incapable of looking beyond us interests or of practicing the universal values of human rights, democracy and peace, then shouldn't the international community reconsider the role played by the un, or learn from the way the european parliament works?
