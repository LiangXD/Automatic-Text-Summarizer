the zionist and us administrations have the illusion that they succeeded in defeating the palestinian people and their valiant intifadah. it is also true that thousands of palestinians and their leaders are held hostage, and that the entire palestinian people are now experiencing the utmost suffering as part of their daily lives. the zionists have succeeded in achieving these things, but a deep-rooted fact is that they have not succeeded, and will never succeed, in breaking the will of this valiant people or in forcing the palestinians into relinquishing their just, legitimate rights and ending their glorious struggle for these rights. the real victor in this battle is, in fact, the palestinian people and not the zionists. as has been acknowledged by uri avneri, a veteran zionist writer, the intifadah's structure exists within millions of palestinians and also within tens of millions of arabs in whose chests the fire of anger is blazing. the conclusion to which we come is that the zionist and us administrations have aggravated the zionist entity's historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that force can break the palestinian people's will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose. contrary to the visible scene and to the illusion of sharon and bush, this zionist-us crime has confirmed that the zionist entity's historical impasse is constantly aggravating and that the arabs' recognition of this entity's right to exist is now more distant than before despite some official arab recognitions.
