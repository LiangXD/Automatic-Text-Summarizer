leaders of the united states probably withheld their breath monday evening while watching on television what russian president vladimir putin was about to say to his people. putin has exceeded the positive neutrality policy his country (the soviet union at the time) has pursued during the gulf war, and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable. true, putin only permitted (americans) to deliver via russian airspace aid to the theater of the anti-terrorism military operations, (i.e. not soldiers and weapons). reformers told putin all along that he should take advantage of the rare opportunity for (russia) to become integrated with the civilized world. after the americans had promised everything good and nice, putin remarked almost as an aside that the events in chechnia could be interpreted only in the context of the struggle against international terrorism. nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the united states called upon the chechens to unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups, and that they accept putin's offer to make peace. if we view this warning against the background that putin's government has always seen usama bin ladin's hands behind chechen terrorism, we were witnessing a late recognition of moscow's views.
