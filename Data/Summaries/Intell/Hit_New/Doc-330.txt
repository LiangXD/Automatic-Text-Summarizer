not only has australia's opposition labor party called for hicks, currently held at guantanamo bay, cuba, to be returned home, but a supreme court justice has described hicks as a casualty of his own government's attempt to maintain favor in washington. the australian government is, frankly, pathetic in that, for the argument of convenience, we are letting this man be held in conditions that clearly violate established conventions on the treatment of prisoners. the us government classifies the men as illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, and therefore they don't have the rights laid out in the geneva convention. opposition justice spokesman darryl melham says the australian government's refusal to demand consular access to its citizen compares poorly with british foreign secretary jack straw's immediate insistence that three british nationals captured with al qaeda should face neither a military tribunal nor the death penalty. the americans seem to have retreated from an earlier position of the death penalty for foreigners, but we are still worried about the extent to which this guy's legal rights are being subjugated to the australian government's shuttle diplomacy with the us. british officials have visited the british captives at guantanamo bay and said they have no complaints about their treatment, which contrasts greatly with the feelings expressed in some of the british press. if hicks and other foreign captives receive markedly different treatment to walker, even though all men served the same taliban, melham predicts damage to the international coalition against terrorism.
