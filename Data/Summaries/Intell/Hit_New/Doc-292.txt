europe to tax israeli settlement goods ramallah (palestine media center): signaling a toughening policy towards the illegal israeli settlements, the european union's (eu) origin committee, which consists of customs experts and commissioners, is to discuss imposing taxes on all israeli goods produced in the occupied palestinian territory, including east jerusalem as well as the occupied golan heights. the discussion is to be held today, 26 february, and it shall be centered on creating a common european policy, which would revoke duty benefits awarded to israeli settlement products. the move, which follows the european union's rejection of israel's military occupation of the palestinian territory, including east jerusalem, was the subject of european debate and israeli objection in the past. in november of last year, the eu had issued a warning to european importers, specifying that israeli exports originating in the occupied palestinian territory as well as the golan heights were not included in the free trade agreement with israel. while israel rejects the eu plan for political and economic reasons, the eu affirms its position of not recognizing the israeli settlements in the occupied palestinian territory as a legitimate part of israel. and while the israeli settlement products only amount to us $100 million of the us $8 billion israel gains annually from its exports to europe, israeli officials have expressed their worry over the committee's deliberations. although high contracting parties to the convention have affirmed the convention's de jure applicability to the occupied palestinian territory, including east jerusalem, israel maintains its refusal to respect its obligations as an occupying power, which would include the dismantling of its illegal settlements in that territory in addition to not exporting any products from them.
