new argentine president quits after a week march vote nixed buenos aires - argentina ended 2001 leaderless and penniless yesterday with its new interim president resigning a week into the job and the country fearing more bloodshed and the loss of savings frozen in the banks. plunged into chaos by looting and deadly riots that forced fernando de la rua to resign as president a week ago, argentina fell deeper into anarchy when interim leader adolfo rodriguez saa quit on sunday after losing his party's support. but bickering politicians agreed the crisis was too serious to subject argentina to the pressure of quick elections, which had been scheduled for march, and decided yesterday to choose an interim leader to rule until 2003, when de la rua's mandate was to end. de la rua's cowed radical party agreed, with senior party official federico storani saying it would be madness to hold elections now because the interim government wouldn't have the power to apply measures to get us over this crisis. the country of 36 million people is living in fear of more shop looting and violence that killed 27 people before de la rua quit, of more riots like those that erupted on friday and of more misery as a four-year-old recession grinds on. 'shameful' ordinary argentines have been pouring into the streets night after hot summer night, banging pots and pans demanding, and eventually receiving, the resignation of de la rua, his unpopular economy minister and aides to rodriguez saa who were suspected of corruption. while the moratorium on part of argentina's $132-billion public debt, heralding the biggest default in history, had long been expected by markets that have dumped argentine bonds this year, rodriguez saa's plans for a new currency caused alarm.
