president unleashes army, rocket launchers, mig-21s subhead: rumblings of rebellion: opposition aghast at 'state terrorism' author: jan cienski harare, zimbabwe - elements of zimbabwe's army began leaving their barracks yesterday in an ominous sign that robert mugabe intends to rig this weekend's presidential election and is preparing for a fight if the opposition challenges him. meanwhile, a group of up to 800 veterans of zimbabwe's independence war has asked for foreign help to mount a rebellion against mr. mugabe if he steals the election. morgan tsvangirai, the mdc leader who is giving mr. mugabe his toughest challenge, accused his opponent of conducting a calculated campaign of intimidation. if mr. mugabe wins, we are going to fight, my friend, said an mdc supporter and trader in harare's main market, while senior government officials have indicated they will not respect an mdc victory. matabeleland has long been a bastion of resistance to mr. mugabe and an mdc stronghold. the appeal, which amounted to a de facto call to arms, risks being represented by mr. mugabe's government as proof of foreign military meddling in zimbabwe. the appeal, which amounted to a de facto call to arms, risks being represented by mr. mugabe's government as proof of foreign military meddling in zimbabwe.
