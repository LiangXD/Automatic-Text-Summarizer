parallel lines to the future : britain is among the front runners as tomorrow '_ s supercomputers take shape , says greg wilson by greg wilson from desk-top micros to the largest mainframes , conventional computers are built around a single processor and a single store of memory. at a seminar hosted by the edinburgh concurrent supercomputer project last month , researchers and vendors could finally say with confidence that supercomputing in the 1990s and beyond will be done by parallel computers. faced with these problems , computer scientists began in the mid 1970s to experiment with using many processors in a single machine to work in parallel on a single problem. while some manufacturers advocated the latter , a more popular approach has been to build computers out_of conventional processors so that many current programs and , more importantly , programming concepts , can be recycled. there are now manufacturers world-wide pursuing variations on this approach , building everything from high-powered graphics work stations for computer-aided design and advertising , like soon-to-merge american firms ardent and stellar , through to teradata , another american company which has sold several hundred of its parallel database machines , to britain '_ s meiko scientific , manufacturer of the computing surface. the edinburgh concurrent supercomputer project ( ecsp ) , under professor david wallace , now has the largest parallel computer in europe , with 400 processors which can perform 400 million arithmetical calculations a second. he pointed out that every major supercomputer manufacturer , including such giants in the conventional supercomputer market as cray , were now building multi-processor machines in_order_to stay competitive.
