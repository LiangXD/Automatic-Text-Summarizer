i personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of microsoft on just one man--at aol, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other characters, for lack of a better word. while i did not attend the trial--i was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of bill gates took a beating and the insular culture of microsoft did not look so good. that's ironic, since i think it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that aol has benefited from being in the virginia suburbs rather than in silicon valley. aol would never have existed if it had been founded here, i am sure, since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati. from where i am sitting, i think the microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age. will the strongman of the era be aol, at&t, microsoft, or one of the big media companies? i always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whether it is aol or microsoft or disney--is in charge of all our destinies: babylon was.
