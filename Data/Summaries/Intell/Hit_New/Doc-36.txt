for_once , the uk is in the good books of the european space agency ( esa ) for our support of the european remote sensing ( ers ) programme , which will use the most complex satellites it has ever attempted to build. & bquo it '_ s one of the most important projects we have for the 1990s , & equo says philip goldsmith , head of earth observation at the european space agency. whilst other space agencies have equally ambitious plans , they remain as blueprints , or , as one european scientist puts it , & bquo pie-in-the-sky-eyes-in-the-sky. & equo ers-1 has five instruments which will scan the earth at microwave wavelengths to monitor ocean , ice and land resources. though esa admits there have been electronic problems with one of the system '_ s processors , it '_ s hardly surprising. & bquo it '_ s the most complex instrument we '_ ve ever built , & equo says joe mccaughey , marconi '_ s project manager. & bquo ers as a whole is a quantum leap for europe. & equo the rutherford appleton laboratory in oxfordshire has provided the along-track scanning radiometer , an infrared instrument which will measure sea surface temperatures down to 0.3c. & bquo there are americans who '_ d give their eye teeth for this sort of data , & equo says one ers project scientist at the laboratory. but the emphasis for ers-1 is science , as the ers programme is esa '_ s contribution to woce , the world ocean circulation experiment , an important part of global climate research in the 1990s. ice coverage limits the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and ocean , effectively & bquo insulating & equo polar regions from sunlight during summertime. & bquo you '_ d be amazed how little we know about the polar regions , & equo says dr preben goodmandsen of the technical university of denmark. & bquo during the wintertime , there '_ s no sunlight. ers-1 is expected to return the first quantitive data on these processes at the poles. & bquo the key to the ers programme is continuity , & equo says guy duchossois of esa headquarters. it '_ s just a matter of finding the money. & equo next week , in paris , esa '_ s governing body of national representatives meets to discuss ers-2 amongst other future plans.
