and now kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $1 billion cereal plant. kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival general mills inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. led by its oat-based cheerios line, general mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of kellogg. the company has five other u.s. plants, including a modern facility at its battle creek headquarters known as building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year. the new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and kellogg's largest construction project. last friday's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic. until recently, kellogg had been telling its sales force and wall street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume.
