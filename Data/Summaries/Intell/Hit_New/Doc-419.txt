but the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that i was ok. all my life i always wanted to be a teacher even from the time i started to school. uh, while i was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that i had an extra bone in my foot and she said, well now sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college. um, i remember once, when i was working in a mill, and i was spinning yarn, and i was saying to myself, and, i was praying actually, and i said, god, one day i want to work in the school system. my husband became very ill with cancer and i had to make a decision as to whether i would continue my education or take care of him and i felt like i needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while i was going to school. i guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that i was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence. um, that, i really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because i was there i think the first year i went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and i don't think they used that gym no more than three years.
