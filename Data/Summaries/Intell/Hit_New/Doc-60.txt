he said stic was likely to post sustainable growth of at_least 20 percent in net profit over the next two years , with its industrial park activities continuing to drive earnings. stic president tay siew choon told a news conference the group would increase its investment in heavy infrastructure projects , including bridges , expressways and power plants , with a continued focus on china , india and indonesia. the group's income from joint ventures fell 6.5 percent to s$8.75 million largely due_to start-up costs for its projects on the indonesian island of bintan. tay said stic's leisure resorts on bintan had only begun operating last year and its industrial park had to realign its focus to attract electronics and engineering companies. he said the first phase of stic's resort project on bintan was likely to start contributing to profits over the next two or three years , eventually helping offset an estimated s$100 million in start-up costs for the second phase. income from associates rose 74.5 percent to s$10.84 million , largely due_to contributions from cathay international investment , a bermuda-incorporated company through which stic operates four bridges and a tunnel in china. tay said the group aimed to build its business to ensure sustainable profit growth of 20-25 percent but added that there could be some volatility on an annual basis , depending on whether its projects were in development or start-up phases.
