harare -- opposition leader morgan tsvangirai has accused zimbabwean president robert mugabe of deliberately withholding food from some areas of the drought-ravaged country as punishment for not voting the correct way in march's election. i feel very strongly for these people, mr. tsvangirai said. because of restrictions on foreign reporters in zimbabwe, it was impossible to obtain direct government comment on mr. tsvangirai's allegations. meanwhile, mr. tsvangirai alleged, the land-reform plan, nominally launched to resettle one million poor families, is actually putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite. meanwhile, mr. tsvangirai alleged, the land-reform plan, nominally launched to resettle one million poor families, is actually putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite. the situation we see now is what i call the last supper -- it is zanu-pf's final feast, mr. tsvangirai said. mr. tsvangirai also touched on his own legal battle with the government: on may 31, he is to stand trial on a charge of treason, accused of plotting to have mr. mugabe assassinated.
