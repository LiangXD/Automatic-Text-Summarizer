finance minister pedro malan insisted yesterday on the need for a more profound constructive engagement on the part of multilateral institutions and governments in helping argentina. malan criticizes the stance taken by multilateral institutions like the imf, who are asking for reforms in argentina before the country can receive financial help. pedro malan's attitude in relation to argentina is very different from that of jaime caruana, governor of the bank of spain, the spanish central bank. malan noted that as part of the constructive engagement in relation to argentina, a group of experts spent the day with authorities from that country, recounting their experiences in situations like the one the argentines are facing. in the group were former bank of mexico governor miguel mancera, who dealt with the peso crisis in 1995 a former chilean central bank president who faced the 1982 crisis, when the chilean gdp dropped by 14 percent former imf fiscal affairs director vito tanzi an expert in restructuring the spanish debt and former brazilian central bank president gustavo loyola, who lived through the time of the collor government's withholdings and of the proer [program to encourage the reorganization and strengthening of the national financial system] - the program to restructure the brazilian banking system. in argentina's defense, malan says that brazil's mercosur partner has sought to define with clarity the fundamental issues of its basic regimes - foreign exchange (floating exchange rate regime), monetary (they intend, after phase of transition, to define their inflation goal system, which was important to spain from 1995-1998) and fiscal. the minister says that after the october elections in brazil, it will be necessary to make more progress in the process of making changes to which the country has been committed over the past years.
