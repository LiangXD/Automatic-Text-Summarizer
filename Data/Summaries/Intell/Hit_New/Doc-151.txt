belgian industry is advocating benchmark covenants because it is afraid that an absolute limit would weaken considerably its competitive position with respect to similar companies in regions where the kyoto protocol is not ratified. second, benchmark covenants do not guarantee that the external climate costs of energy use (the increased greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuels) are correctly taken into account in the final products of the sectors concerned. fourth is the contrast between the benchmark covenants' relative emissions standards and the belgian government's absolute restrictions on emissions within the framework of the kyoto protocol. since industry does not wish to let itself be pinned down on an absolute emissions ceiling, while the government feels itself committed to an absolute ceiling, industry is foisting the necessary efforts onto other sectors in society through the benchmark covenants. this european proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the flemish benchmark covenants. however, the benchmark covenants could be opportune here for settling the initial allocation of emission rights. by using the benchmark covenants to allocate emission rights initially, the good points of covenants are retained and their drawbacks are eliminated.
