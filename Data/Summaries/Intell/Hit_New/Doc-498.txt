australia's plans to construct a space port on christmas island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of jakarta, has concerned some in the indonesian government. therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from christmas island if australia is really willing to listen to indonesia's objections. as the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the australian space port, indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the liability convention, section 14. these un conventions are the treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies 1967 (space treaty 1967), the convention on international liability for damage caused by space objects 1972 (liability convention 1972), and finally, the convention on registration of objections launched into outer space 1974 (registration convention 1974). a national space and flight agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim. in the case of objections to the christmas island space station, indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the christmas island station. the basic principles of the space treaty 1967 oblige australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour.
