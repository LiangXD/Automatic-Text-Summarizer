endeavour links to space station with delivery of fresh 3-man crew cape canaveral -- space shuttle endeavour docked with the international space station friday, delivering a new three-member crew to relieve the men who have been up there since august. the shuttle pulled up as the two spacecraft orbited 250 miles above the polish-ukrainian border, ending a two-day chase. space station commander frank culbertson had eagerly awaited the arrival of endeavour, his ride home. "we're ready to see you guys," culbertson radioed once endeavour pulled within 1 1/2 miles. he watched as the shuttle, a ghostly white against the blackness of space, drew ever closer. as endeavour slowly closed the final 40 feet, culbertson rang the ship's bell aboard the space station and announced in the tradition of the high seas, "endeavour arriving." culbertson and his crewmates, vladimir dezhurov and mikhail tyurin, will move out of the space station today.
