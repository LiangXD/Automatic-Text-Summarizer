according to a report released in 2000 by the national air issues co-ordinating committee on climate change, a group staffed by officials from the federal, provincial and territorial governments, hitting canada's kyoto target may mean the loss of roughly one year's growth, or, viewed in absolute terms, in 2010, the loss in annual economic output of approximately $40-billion (or $1,100 per capita). as for the globally felt benefits that would follow from canada's implementation of the kyoto protocol, they are slight. even if canada managed to convince the united states and every other kyoto signatory to ratify the protocol, world carbon dioxide emissions would still soar. according to the u.s. energy information administration, world energy consumption will increase by about 60% between now and 2020, with most of the upsurge expected to come from developing nations, which are not covered by the kyoto protocol. while helping third world nations plant new crops, vaccinate people and relocate coastal towns will be costly, the bottom line will likely be only a fraction of kyoto's 13-digit price tag. kyoto protocol download the full text in pdf here. climate change/kyoto protocol activities a list of related meetings, conferences projects and reports on the accord hosted by the united nations industrial development organization.
