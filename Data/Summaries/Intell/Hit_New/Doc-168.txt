dr. ren guoyu, an expert meteorologist at the national climate center of china, pointed out that the kyoto protocol was only the first step to resolve global warming during his interview with xinhua news agency. in march, the new bush administration openly declared it would rescind its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol. the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by most developing nations in the past several decades only represents a small fraction of the total emission. furthermore, on a per capita basis, emissions by developing nations are also far less than that by industrialized nations. to implement the kyoto protocol, according to dr. ren, usually a country would incur an economic loss equivalent to 1 percent of its gdp when it tries to lower greenhouse emissions 1 percent. as a reminder, dr. ren pointed out: the kyoto protocol is merely a gesture for mankind to stop global warming. dr. ren suggested that developing nations should also join forces in emissions reduction in the future.
