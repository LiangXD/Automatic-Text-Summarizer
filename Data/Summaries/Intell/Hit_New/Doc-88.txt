1997-03-31 great western financial corp said monday hostile suitor h.f. ahmanson and co's effort to solicit shareholder consents to start negotiations has fallen _ far short _ of a majority of the outstanding shares. earlier monday , ahmanson said more than 80 percent of _ voted _ great western shares supported its proposals. in a press release , great western said _ it is an indisputable fact that an overwhelming majority of great western stockholders have not consented to ahmanson's proposed resolutions and amendments to great western's by-laws. _ the release continued , _ what ahmanson has carefully avoided acknowledging is that it has fallen far short_of obtaining the necessary consents from a majority of great western shares by its artificial march 27 deadline. _ peter gleason , an analyst with institutional shareholder services ( iss ) said that , under delaware law , ahmanson can continue soliciting consents until approximately may 12. he said that , although ahmanson had tried to garner a majority of consents by march 27 , that was _ not a real date. _ iss is a consulting firm that advises large institutional investors on how to vote their shares on issues of corporate governance. a spokesman for ahmanson , reading a prepared statement , characterized great western's announcement as _ more obfuscation. _ comments: this provides the referent for the spokesman in another sentence, but is not itself relevent. the spokesman said ahmanson stands behind its numbers that more than 80 percent of voted shares back its solicitation and that 19 of great western's 20 largest shareholders have voted for or indicated a vote for ahmanson's proposals. asked if ahmanson would continue to solicit consents , he responded , _ that_ 's correct. _ the ahmanson spokesman continued : _ despite great western's rhetoric it has been clear from the outset that this consent solicitation is about creating a level playing field for all bidders , good corporate governance and maximizing stockholder value. _ great western , in its press release , said ahmamnson was trying to divert attention from an _ inferior merger proposdal. _ a wall street arbitrager , who requested anonymity , said that , without knowing how many shares have been voted , the ahmanson figures were like an _ exit poll. _ _ it_ 's impressive they_ 're getting this percentage of consents without a doubt , but i_ 'm still not sure where it leaves you , _ the arbitrager said.
