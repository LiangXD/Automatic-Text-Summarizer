kawamura: one of the reasons that the united states has all along not provided aegis destroyers to taiwan is that in the past the united states considered taiwan's armed forces to be the armed forces of the nationalist party, not the armed forces of the nation. question: where is china's true threat to taiwan sato: china's threat to taiwan is the use of the three methods of missiles, amphibious landing, and submarine blockades. taiwan has some people who very obviously purposely play up china's use of force to scare taiwan. before the united states attacked afghanistan, it first explained the reasons to every nation of the world, and china using missiles to attack taiwan is certainly not simple. i reckon that the probability of war occurring between china and taiwan is smaller than small. not using peaceful methods to resolve the taiwan issue won't do, and i reckon that the us-japan summit talks will discuss the issue of the two shores. taiwan announcing independence is not itself a problem, but because taiwan announcing independence would bring unrest and a domino effect would occur with regard to tibet and xinjiang, this is china's greatest fear.
