by richard longworth diesel engines are the most fuel efficient vehicle power source available. but diesel engines also have very dirty exhaust emissions. while many politicians have only recently seen their green light many diesel engine manufacturers have looked further ahead , and have been developing cleaner engines , principally in response to stringent american legislation. unlike lead , which the fuel companies eventually proved only too pleased to take out_of petrol , sulphur does nothing for either the performance or longevity of diesel engines and it contributes to acid rain. currently , diesel fuel sold in the ec contains 0.3 per_cent sulphur , except in west germany where the level is 0.25 per_cent. klaus schubert , technicaldirector at man , says his company would like to see it reduced to 0.02 per_cent , but recognises that 0.05 per_cent is a more realistic level. however john bullock , retail fuels technical manager at shell uk , says the price of the fuel would rise significantly , because extra crude would have to be refined to run the hydro-desulphurisation process.
