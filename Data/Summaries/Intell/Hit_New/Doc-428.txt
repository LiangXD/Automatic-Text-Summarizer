husbands and wives chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext (and hence much of the appeal) of a hillary clinton-rudy giuliani senate race would be wronged wife vs. neglectful husband. the media conventional wisdom is that giuliani would make hillary clinton's marital problems a major campaign issue. giuliani's estrangement from his wife, donna hanover, is made clear in an interview with hanover that appears in today's new york times. but she did say in the interview, which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about hillary rodham clinton's interest in the same new york senate seat, that mrs. clinton is a 'very interesting' person. and, for a punch line: ms. hanover's press secretary, joannie danielides, said this week that ms. hanover had no comment on mrs. clinton's potential senate campaign. does she have any comment on whether ms. hanover plans to be hillary clinton's campaign manager? indis index update: nbc, in its juanita broaddrick broadcast last night, turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by broaddrick in the late 1970s that bill clinton raped her.
