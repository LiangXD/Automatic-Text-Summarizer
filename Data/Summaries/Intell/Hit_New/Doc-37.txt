there is a ministry proposal called & bquo extensification. & equo it means that the whole farm has to produce 20 per_cent less. it is called & bquo set aside. & equo a proportion of the farm ? or for that matter all of it ? is set aside , left fallow , mown once a year while the farmer draws a set fee per acre and manages on the rest or gets another job. there is a big fear in the hills that in_order_to maintain businesses in the lowlands , people will diversify into sheep , and the profitability of sheep in the lowlands will be greater. & equo in fact , the countryside commission has just announced an imaginative scheme for 12 & bquo community forests & equo on marginal urban fringe farmland. there are also emotional objections. & bquo we wish to see as many farmers as possible occupying the countryside , & equo said melinda appleby. & bquo we want to see a working countryside and we do n't want to see it fossilised so it '_ s almost like a theme park. & equo farmers have higher hopes of the & bquo extensification & equo programme in the wings. so & bquo extended & equo farms will have to leave a wide strip of unsown soil in each field , and let the hedges grow. and they still wo n't feel enthusiastic about extensification. & bquo to a farmer it '_ s an anathema not to produce on his land and therefore it '_ s not that he is not being responsible in meeting the challenges. & equo many farmers , it turns out , would n't in the least object to making the countryside ? their countryside ? more attractive. she goes on : & bquo the problem with taking a management decision out_of a farmer '_ s hands as an economic decision and putting it into conservationists hands is that the conservationists do n't always agree. & bquo in the future , it seems , we are going to be taking arbitrary decisions about what we want from the countryside : the large blue here , a certain bird there , and we are going to manage for those species , which will mean that everything_else will go. & equo the countryside may be changing.
