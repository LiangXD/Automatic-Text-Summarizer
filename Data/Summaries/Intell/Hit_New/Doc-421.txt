perhaps because jerusalem was in neutral territory not allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of israel, david made it the capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented artisans, dedicated priests, magical poets and musicians, and the most formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city. but with his death the empire collapsed, and the israelite kingdom was divided into two separate, impoverished, often warring nations: israel, with its capital at shechem in the north, ruled by a series of northern dynasties and the smaller kingdom of judah, with its capital at jerusalem, from which the davidic dynasty continued to rule. roman jerusalem after the initial years of roman administration and political infighting, rome installed herod (scion of a family from idumea, a jewish kingdom in the desert) as king of judea. much of the best islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times. west jerusalem, separated from the rest of the new jewish nation, held out under siege for several months until israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the coastal areas. as a result of armistice agreements in 1949, jerusalem was divided: west jerusalem was to be under israeli control, and east jerusalem (including the old city, with its jewish, muslim, christian, and armenian quarters) came under jordanian authority. however, with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire, no israeli or jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the western wall or other jewish sites in east jerusalem.
