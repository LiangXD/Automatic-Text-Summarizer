already, washington's refusal to grant them official prisoner-of- war status has sparked protests from human rights groups, and a disagreement with the international committee of the red cross (icrc), which oversees the geneva conventions. defense secretary donald rumsfeld told re- porters that we do plan to, for the most part, treat them in a manner that is reasonably consistent with the geneva conventions, to the extent that they are appropriate. but he was careful to refer to the prisoners as unlawful combatants or battlefield detainees, not prisoners of war. that description severely reduces the rights that the men would have as pows under the geneva conventions, and prompted a rebuttal from the international red cross. under the third geneva convention, prisoners of war may only be tried in the same courts and according to the same rules, as soldiers of the country that is holding the prisoners. under the geneva conventions, pows must be returned home at the end of the war. i don't think anything quite like this was envisioned when the geneva conventions were drawn up, says tom farer, dean of denver university's graduate school of international studies and a former special assistant to the defense department's special counsel.
