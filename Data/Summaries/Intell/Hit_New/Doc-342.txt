zimbabwean presidential vote begins author: angus shaw harare, zimbabwe (ap) - zimbabweans waited in long lines outside polling stations saturday, some knitting and playing with their children, while waiting for the chance to vote in elections that present the strongest challenge yet to president robert mugabe. following a campaign wracked by intense violence and intimidation blamed on the ruling party, opposition leader morgan tsvangirai said he was pleased to see so many people voting, believing a strong turnout favored him over the man who has ruled this country since independence in 1980. mugabe is trying to move the goal posts to disenfranchise people, these people he thinks will vote against him, tsvangirai said, urging voters in line to be patient. the number of polling stations in urban areas, considered opposition strongholds, were cut by half by the government. the opposition says scores of its polling agents have been detained or harassed the government refused to accredit most independent zimbabwean voting monitors, but many of them showed up outside of polling stations anyway. lines snaked around polling stations in harare, one of them more than a mile long. the opposition had asked the supreme court to overturn mugabe's decree restoring the controversial election laws, as well as to resolve confusion over voter registration and the location of polling stations and allow the polls to remain open if long lines made it impossible for some to vote.
