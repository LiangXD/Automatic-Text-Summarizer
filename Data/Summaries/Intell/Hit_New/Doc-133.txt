islamic countries are with the us in combatting terrorism but we don't want it to be prolonged because it can create trouble and instability all around the islamic world, he said. syed hamid said the international community must deal with terrorism rationally and form a new security architecture to combat what he described as a new dimension of crime against humanity in the long term. this is not the conventional security but it is internal and we must look at terrorism and its sources, he said. over the long term, we have to look at how terrorism manifests itself and have an international convention where terrorism is properly defined and where it is considered as a crime against humanity so there can be a proper tribunal. syed hamid said critics must also accept that the war against terrorism could affect civil liberties. the summit is set to issue an anti-terrorism declaration at the conclusion of the largest gathering of world leaders since the september 11 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon. the declaration was necessary because terrorism was the most dangerous enemy of law-abiding citizens and an affront against law and democracy , syed hamid said.
