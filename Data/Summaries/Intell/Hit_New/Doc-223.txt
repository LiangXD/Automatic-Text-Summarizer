but the eu is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce us emissions. the intensity target proposed allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change. while the intensity improvements may reduce this to around 33%, this is still a very substantial increase in absolute emissions. the eu is concerned about the purely voluntary nature of the actions proposed. the eu is of the opinion that a cap-and-trade system is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions which combines a guaranteed environmental result with the flexibility to reduce emissions where it is least costly. by 2005, the eu intends to implement a cap-and-trade system covering 46% of all co2 emissions in 2010. however, mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions at company level would be necessary to adequately assess whether the proposals by president bush represent an effort comparable to the ones under the kyoto protocol.
