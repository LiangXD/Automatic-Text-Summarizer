on thursday the arab summit in the lebanese capital of beirut ended with the adoption of a resolution whose content illustrated how far the arab world has come since the summit that took place in the sudanese capital of khartoum in 1967, shortly after the israeli victory in the six days war. on thursday the summit adopted a resolution that proposed the recognition of the jewish state, normal relations, and an end to the conflict in return for israeli withdrawal from the palestinian territories that israel has occupied for almost 35 years. the resolution that was put forward by saudi arabia was a plea addressed to the israeli people over the heads of ariel sharon's government. as a first step israeli forces were sent into the main palestinian town, ramallah, where arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous palestinian areas are administered. israeli's antiterrorist operations must not bring the palestinian authority to collapse, israeli forces must not reconquer the territories under the jurisdiction of the authority, and arafat the man must not be molested. it cannot solve the israeli people's security problems, because the root of the terrorism is the israeli occupation and the israeli settlements on occupied territory. the day the israeli tanks again leave ramallah they will have sown the seed for new terrorist actions.
