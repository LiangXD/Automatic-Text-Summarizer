the attacks on the world trade center towers and the pentagon were attacks on the freedoms and values for which the united states and the western world stand, president bush declared shortly afterward, and many people in europe repeated it after him. apart from the reasons or justification for such an action, all the combatants' war conduct must be constantly tested against the standards of international humanitarian law that is, the rules which curb the use of force during a military operation. many countries are parties to them, but the united states has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which us troops are taking part. secretary rumsfeld's statements (on 20 november 2001) that the united states is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners, and that my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the northern alliance) also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the taliban and al-qa'ida fighters. humanitarian law leaves no doubt that those who fall captive in their opponent's hands are entitled at all times to decent treatment, even if they do not qualify for prisoner of war status. presumed war criminals such as milosevic enjoy all the guarantees of a fair trial, but the taliban and al-qa'ida fighters at guantanamo will get a trial which falls far short of the basic standards of the us constitution and the treaty on civil and political rights ratified by the united states. the fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected.
