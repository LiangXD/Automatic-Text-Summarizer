westinghouse electric corp., capitalizing on a major restructuring program, expects operating margins of more than 10% and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year, top officers told securities analysts here. john c. marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5% annually through the next three years. since 1983, westinghouse has shed 70 businesses that it didn't expect to produce 10% operating margins while acquiring 55 businesses. mr. marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company's target goal of 8.5%. westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to 25% of total corporate sales from 20% last year. mr. marous said westinghouse would own 70% of the facility. company officials also said that any gain from the sale of westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the swiss firm of asea brown boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
