at no time was it clearer that countries should take steps to slow this process than when 150 countries signed the kyoto protocol in 1997. but now, with president george bush saying the us will not ratify the protocol - which was shaped in part to fit washington's concerns five years ago - the accord's ultimate effectiveness is in doubt, and many us allies are irritated. it is absolutely inadmissible for the us, which is the greatest gas-emitting country, to once again turn its back and present something that is against kyoto protocol and the framework convention on climate change, says mie asaoka, president of the kiko network, a tokyo environmental-umbrella organization representing about 150 japanese groups. during mr. bush's visit here last month, mr. koizumi gently balked at the president's proposed alternative to the kyoto agreement, saying that japan would like to see further efforts on the part of the us. in the eyes of japan and many us allies, the bush administration's decision not to ratify the kyoto protocol is one of many signals that washington is growing increasingly unilateralist in the six months since the sept. the bush administration is offering its own alternative plan, the clear skies and global climate change initiatives, which aides say are more market-sensitive and will reduce the worst air pollutants by 70 percent while finding a strategy to cut greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent over the next 10 years. they fear that, because the us is forging its own way, smaller nations that are expected to ratify the kyoto protocol could start backing out.
