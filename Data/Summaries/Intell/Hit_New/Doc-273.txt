courtaulds plc announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value. the establishment of the separate company, to be called courtaulds textiles, could be effective as early as next year's first quarter. courtaulds' restructuring is among the largest thus far in britain, though it is dwarfed by b.a.t industries plc's plans to spin off roughly #4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from anglo-french financier sir james goldsmith. some analysts have said courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined. courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including australian financier kerry packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year. even without a specific takeover threat, courtaulds is giving shareholders choice and value, said julia blake, an analyst at london stockbrokers barclays de zoete wedd. courtaulds chairman and chief executive sir christopher hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff.
