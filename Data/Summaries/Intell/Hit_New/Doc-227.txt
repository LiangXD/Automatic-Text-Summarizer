[ opinion u.s. human rights claims only empty rhetoric] the u.s. state department on monday published its annual report on the status of human rights in other countries in the year 2001. in this report, when referring to iran, the united states repeated its allegations against the islamic republic but failed to provide any evidence in support of its baseless charges. among the unfounded allegations was the claim that the islamic republic enjoys no social base and is an unpopular system because of its human rights violations. it is interesting that the u.s. state department's annual global human rights report came this year at a time when washington itself is being sharply criticized by most countries and international human rights organizations for the killing of a large number of innocent civilians in afghanistan and the torture and inhuman treatment of the taleban and al-qaeda prisoners at its military base at guantanamo bay. indeed, the u.s administration, which claims to advocate international human rights issues and which tries to play the role of a world policeman, is actually condoning the most atrocious human rights violations committed in the united states itself. although the united states claims to advocate human rights, its harsh treatment of its own citizens and its hegemonic and belligerent policy towards other nations prove that the claim is just empty rhetoric.
