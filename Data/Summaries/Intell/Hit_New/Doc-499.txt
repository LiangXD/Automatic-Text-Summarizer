c'wealth mission conduct questionable by a special correspondent - britain's prime minister, tony blair, privately did two things concerning zimbabwe during the recent retreat by commonwealth leaders in australia that raise questions about today's meeting in london by the troika of australia, nigeria and south africa. the first was that blair said he had received an interim report from the commonwealth observer mission to zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote. the british leader fudged his reply and the commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the blair report had already been written in london before the commonwealth mission even left for zimbabwe. blair's second faux pas in australia, according to some of the assembled commonwealth leaders, came in his response to a remarkably conciliatory speech by zimbabwe's foreign minister, dr stan mudenge. but there was still an unanswered question in the minds of the commonwealth leaders: how had the british prime minister seen the purported commonwealth report on zimbabwe when they had not? a namibian woman member of the commonwealth observer mission, who is the well-respected, deputy speaker of the national council in her country, held different views to those stated in the interim commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known. presidents obasanjo and mbeki, however, have the benefit of their own observer missions to zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the commonwealth.
