in the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval, the aegean islands next came under the influence of the mycenaeans (at around 1300 b.c. ), who had a base in the peloponnese region of the greek mainland. from a power base in anatolia, the persians overran the eastern aegean islands and set their sights on the cyclades. although in 88 b.c. , mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the east across asia minor and the aegean islands, the next major power change brought influence from the west. the genoese took control of the eastern aegean islands, which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade. in 1566, they wrested chios from the genoese, bolstering their hold on the eastern aegean islands, but the cyclades remained in venetian hands for another generation or more -- tinos was the last to fall in 1715. in 1770, russia came to aid the greeks (defined by their orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries), declaring war on the ottoman empire and occupying several aegean islands until 1774. the expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism, and greece along with the aegean islands became exciting destinations for northern europeans escaping their damp, cool summers.
