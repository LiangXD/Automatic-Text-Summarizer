the computers are biological molecules, using dna for software and enzymes for hardware, and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second. some scientists believe dna-based computers could have an advantage over existing computers based on silicon chips. although computers with dna input and output have been made before, they have always involved a laborious series of reactions, each requiring human supervision. professor shapiro and a growing number of other scientists believe dna-based computers may lead to a number of useful applications -- they could be planted inside cells, where they would watch for irregularities or even synthesize drugs. let's say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a b dna type appears in a dna section is odd or even. the dna section -- the input -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer's hardware. the computer can also do other calculations, such as checking whether the b sequence appears at least once, or at most once, by inserting different types of software dnas.
