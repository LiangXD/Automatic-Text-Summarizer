the man whom some economists say is leading the step backward in time is the country's new president, eduardo duhalde, argentina's fifth in two weeks. after four years of crippling recession, duhalde and others are questioning whether argentina's decade-long pursuit of free market reforms is the right solution. with his appointment by congress last wednesday to finish the two years left in the term vacated by ex-president fernando de la r?he peronist duhalde is now promoting a number of emergency measures that would turn back the clock on liberal economic reforms. on friday, president duhalde asked congress for broad new powers to end the country's decade-old currency regime that pegs the peso to the us dollar, to intervene in the banking system, to institute price controls, and to protect local industry and jobs. but some analysts are concerned that duhalde will follow it up with a return to the protectionism and failed policies that dominated the country's economy for half of this past century, until ex-president carlos menem changed course last decade and ushered in an era of stability. a weekend poll by aresco consultancy showed 52 percent of argentines highly in favor of duhalde's stated economic plans and another 34 percent giving him medium approval - an indication of public confidence. although he's so far successfully rallied the country's political class behind him, duhalde, a former vice president to menem and two-time governor of buenos aires province, has been dogged by allegations of corruption throughout his career.
