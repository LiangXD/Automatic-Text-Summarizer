unlike him, mk joseph paritzky did his best to undermine confidence in the israeli shekel when he told israelis to consider transferring their wealth abroad. most of the argentine government's debt is in dollars, while most of the israeli government's debt is, fortunately, in shekels. the structure of the israeli economy is basically sound, but on the other hand, israel is at war, with a significant proportion of its resources devoted to defense. based on false premises regarding anticipated government revenues and underestimates of the need for defense expenditures, a totally unrealistic budget was prepared. at the same time, there was no let-up in his continuing battle with the governor of the bank of israel, who is supposed to be his partner in managing israel's economy. it should be clear that the problem israel is facing at this time has much more than just an economic dimension. but successful management of the economy - the second front - is essential so that the resources needed for defense needs can be made available without causing serious damage to the economy. @ copyright 2002 ha'aretz.
