foreign firms furiously lobby in argentina buenos aires -- foreign multinational companies trying to avoid billions in losses furiously lobbied argentine lawmakers and the new government ahead of today's final vote on emergency legislation to devalue the peso and end the country's decade-old currency parity with the u.s. dollar. u.s. and other foreign banks, telecommunications, transport and energy companies are expected collectively to lose billions of dollars if lawmakers approve president eduardo duhalde's controversial economic package. the economic package nonetheless was passed by argentina's lower house late saturday night and is expected to gain easy passage through the senate today. on saturday, congress began debating an emergency package that would grant vast special powers over the economy to duhalde, argentina's fifth president in less than three weeks. most debt in dollars more than 80 percent of personal debt in argentina is in dollars, and most of that debt is held by the middle class. foreign companies are also trying to reverse a portion of the emergency package that proposes to end a decade of billing in dollars at the gas pump, or for fixed and cellular phone services, water and power bills and the like. foreign companies that took over former state transportation, phone and energy companies want -- but appear unlikely to get -- some form of indexing so they can raise their prices to compensate for what is expected to be a widening gap between the peso and dollar.
