a report about settlement activity in palestinian territories has confirmed that 36 new settlement sites--settlement enclaves--have been created since sharon became prime minister of israel less than a year ago. the annual report published by the national bureau for defending land and resisting colonization in cooperation with the international solidarity establishment for human rights said that the nuclei of 36 new settlements were established from march 2001 to the end of november 2001 in various parts of the west bank. he pointed to the allocations in the sharon government's budget for supporting and widening settlements and building new ones, despite the crisis and recession from which israel's economy suffers. he said: at a time when israel's economic growth rate declined to 1.5 percent and the budgets of the ministry of labor and welfare and other ministries were cut, sharon's government maintained its support for settlements and increased it to compensate for the growing exodus from settlements. advocate faris abu-hasan pointed to the violation of international laws represented in settlement activity and settlement building, and to israel's continuing refusal to respond to international appeals and violation of relevant international laws. he said: there are two grave violations, the first concerns settlement building and the transfer of settlers to the palestinian territories on which tens of settlements have been built. he surveyed the attacks against unarmed citizens carried out by settlers, the legal protection and backing they are provided by israeli governments, and the encouragement that this gives them to continue their assaults.
