their loved ones were gunned down, first by sympathizers of mr. chavez and subsequently by supporters of the short-lived interim government. mr. chavez was ousted in a military coup on april 12 after 17 persons were killed during an anti-chavez protest, apparently by sharpshooters faithful to the president. mr. chavez has placed his cronies in every democratic institution, from congress to the courts, and is expected to prevent any honest inquiry. according to taped radio conversations broadcast yesterday in venezuela on radio and television, mr. chavez ordered tanks and troops to surround the presidential palace, as unarmed civilian protesters marched against him on april 11. indeed, after all the muscle-flexing, mr. chavez has little to offer the venezuelan people. in fact, mr. chavez consolidated his power by rewriting the country's constitution in 1999. interestingly, mr. chavez initially rose to power in the 1990s because of the discontent with former president carlos andres perez, who had ordered the military to shoot at crowds in 1989.
