the two african leaders, thabo mbeki of south africa and olusegun obasanjo of nigeria, maintained a cryptic silence while mr. howard spoke, endorsing the decision by their presence at a news conference but avoiding embroilment in a debate over whether they now view mr. mugabe's presidency as illegitimate. mr. mbeki and mr. obasanjo - both of whose countries have under past undemocratic regimes been excluded from the commonwealth - are torn between solidarity with a fellow african leader who was a crusader against colonialism, and their commitment to democratic standards as part of african economic regeneration. the move avoids an open rift between its majority members in africa and asia, some of which have tended to side with mr. mugabe, and rich, white-ruled countries like britain, canada and australia, which have criticized him. the committee has decided to suspend zimbabwe from the councils of the commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate effect, mr. howard said, reading the statement alone, apparently as a face-saving gesture to mr. mbeki, whose own election observers in zimbabwe found the vote legitimate. the response to mr. mugabe's behavior was seen by many outsiders as a token of south africa's and nigeria's own commitment to democracy as a way of fostering economic renewal. the commonwealth also supported moves to resolve the country's violent crisis over the seizure of white farmers' land, backing mr. mugabe in his commitment to redistribute territory among landless black zimbabweans. according to the statement, the leaders of south africa and nigeria will continue to talk to mr. mugabe about ways to lift the suspension.
