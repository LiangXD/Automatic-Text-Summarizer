under the request of organizations, such as the international red cross, and the media, the united states let them go to guantanamo to inspect the situation of the detainees there. ann crawd [name transliterated], chairwoman of the un human rights commission, pointed out: the united states shall not play with human rights and may not violate the geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war that we have signed. these prisoners not only are citizens of the belligerent country, but also are citizens of nonbelligerent countries, even citizens of the united states' allies, such as britain. therefore, on the issue of defining these prisoners' status, the united states must test the attitudes of the international community, especially the attitudes of european countries. the detainees' status -- an issue concerning their life and death after visiting the guantanamo prisoners' camp, many international organizations and media are accusing the united states of being too harsh for the prisoners. if the united states insisted that these prisoners are to be tried at a military tribunal, it is almost certain that they will be sentenced to death. what worries the west and some other countries most is that, if the united states refuses to treat these detainees as pows, then their soldiers may be treated the same way as the guantanamo prisoners should they be captured by the taliban remnants and other radical organizations when they take part in the united nations' peace-keeping missions.
