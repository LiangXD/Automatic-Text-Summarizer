after spending months in frigid afghanistan caves subsisting on allah knows what, the 158 detainees the united states is holding in tropical guantanamo bay must think they've died and gone to heaven. the detainees should look at the balmy camp x-ray -- replete with running water, three square meals a day and modern medical care -- as a sort of taliban version of club med. amnesty international issued a press release accusing the united states of keeping prisoners incommunicado, (using) sensory deprivation, the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them in an effort to 'break' the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation. it should be noted that much of the uproar is over photographs of the detainees taken as they were being transported from airplanes to their cells. the military wisely shackles prisoners during transport: that's when it's easiest for violent people to hurt others. as the washington post reported, foreign office parliamentary secretary ben bradshaw also explained that there were no gags, no goggles, no earmuffs and no shackles while (the prisoners) are in their cells. instead, amnesty international and the comrades are outraged that the military is treating al qaeda captives like prisoners.
