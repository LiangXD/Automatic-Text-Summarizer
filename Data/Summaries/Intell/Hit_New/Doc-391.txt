the 110 al-qaeda and taliban prisoners admitted to gitmo by the end of last week are, said rumsfeld, the hardest of the hard core, men who had killed dozens and dozens of people. in the meantime, the prisoners at camp x-ray--as the place has been called since the early 1990s when it housed haitian refugees--have been given thin green mats and blankets on which to sleep and pray, and are allowed to shower and exercise. last week a delegation from the international committee of the red cross arrived to inspect the camp and offer private recommendations on its operation. the pentagon has resisted calling the detainees prisoners of war, preferring the terms unlawful combatants or battlefield detainees. under the geneva convention, those holding true pows are bound to release them at the end of hostilities but that is the last thing the u.s. wants to do with men who may be al-qaeda operatives. the geneva convention does contemplate that some irregular forces captured in battle need not be considered pows. that may be so unfortunately, as amnesty international has pointed out, under the geneva convention the pentagon has no business making such a determination.
