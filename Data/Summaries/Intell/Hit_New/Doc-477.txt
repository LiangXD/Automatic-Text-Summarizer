buenos aires, 22 april (telam) -- justicialist deputy jose manuel diaz bancalari said today that the imf is seeking to create an uncontrollable social situation with the demands it has made of the government and, on the other hand, he confirmed the pj [justicialist party] bloc's willingness to support approval of the draft law on bonds submitted by the executive branch. it seems as if they are seeking to create an uncontrollable social situation, the legislator stated this morning, referring to the demands presented by the imf to the country for reaching a new agreement that would bring in foreign financing for the government's accounts. analyzing the imf's responsibility in the complex crisis the country is experiencing, diaz bancalari stated his impression that the imf members want more money for themselves, without admitting any degree of co-responsibility their managers have had in the things that have happened in argentina. he believes that in any negotiation there may be someone who tries to impose conditions by cheating and said that in the case of argentina, the cheaters were the imf, who praised the policies (of the last decade) and held them up as an example and now they cannot tell us that they did not know what was going on. i think there must be reasonable things in the agreement the country reaches with the imf, diaz bancalari said, and then he asserted that argentina is a country in which one can do good business, but what they must know is that there is no more room for shady deals. all the governments are saying that argentina has to make arrangements first with the imf before receiving any kind of aid, and they know perfectly well that they are asking us to put 450,000 fellow citizens out of work, and that is only possible with a military government, he asserted. regarding the draft law from the executive branch on swapping bonds for fixed-term deposits, he believes that if the senate debates and approves it today the deputies can debate the issue tomorrow and pass it, so that on wednesday [24 april] the financial system would be open.
