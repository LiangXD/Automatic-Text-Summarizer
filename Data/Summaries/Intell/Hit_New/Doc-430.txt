stephanopoulos analyzes his own crime there was former clinton aide george stephanopoulos on abc's this week this morning, furrow-browed and heartbroken with all the evidence coming out against the president. by lending credence to the lewinsky charges, and treating clinton's familiar defenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, stephanopoulos shows he's not a fool. during the 1992 campaign, when gennifer flowers first brought clinton's philandering to public attention, stephanopoulos--as clinton's chief spinner, distracter, and all-around bullshit artist--played a crucial role in discrediting flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth, namely that clinton had a disturbing zipper problem. near the end of the war room, stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of clinton paramours, which he is about to publicize. you might say that stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection techniques that seem to have made clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught. when democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of clinton, they don't need to look much further than the big lie about philandering that stephanopoulos, carville (and a cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992. if clinton, as is now increasingly clear, was a time bomb waiting to explode, then stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the white house and muffled the ticking.
