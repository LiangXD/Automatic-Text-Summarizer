21 - the deadly riots in argentina, the collapse of its government and another multibillion dollar bailout gone awry have raised fresh questions about the effectiveness of the international monetary fund and the financial policies of the united states, the fund's leading shareholder. some say the monetary fund showed callousness by failing to give new aid to argentina early this month, as the country's economic program, designed with i.m.f. approval, was forcing painful austerity measures on its citizens. the french, who like the united states are significant fund shareholders, have called on the lending agency to step up its involvement to help argentina recover. when argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, bush administration officials did not take a firm position, allowing the i.m.f. to make the call on withholding additional loans, people involved in the fund's deliberations said. michael mussa, the i.m.f.'s chief economist until last spring, said the fund was justified in providing aid to argentina late last year. but he said that he disagreed with the decision by the fund and the bush administration to continue the aid program in august, when he said the situation in argentina had likely deteriorated beyond repair. at an august meeting at i.m.f. headquarters, fund officials told domingo cavallo, argentina's economy minister, that the country would be better off delaying debt payments.
