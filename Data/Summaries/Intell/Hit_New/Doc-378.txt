harsh detention for afghan prisoners taleban and al-qaeda prisoners flown from afghanistan to an american naval base in the caribbean are being held in tough conditions of detention. a temporary detention centre called camp x-ray has been set up at the base in guantanamo bay, an isolated us outpost on the edge of fidel castro's cuba. as the base is located outside sovereign territory, the prisoners have no legal rights under the us constitution, and no right of appeal to federal courts. the first group to arrive - 20 prisoners described by us military officials as the worst elements of al-qaeda and the taleban - wore goggles covered with tape and had their hands tied. hundreds of marines and military police have been flown to guantanamo bay to expand the compound to house up to 2,000 prisoners. us officials are eager to question the three, who they believe may have vital clues about the whereabouts of mullah omar and osama bin laden. the hunt continues for bin laden himself and mullah omar, who is believed to have escaped by motorbike as thousands of afghan soldiers closed in on his suspected hideout.
