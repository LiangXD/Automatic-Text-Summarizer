zimbabwe suspended for rigging election subhead: 'bad decision,' mugabe camp says author: robert fife, ottawa bureau chief ottawa - the commonwealth suspended zimbabwe for a year yesterday and called for new elections after concluding robert mugabe had rigged recent presidential elections. election observers reported thousands of voters were not given the chance to cast ballots in the election, while others were intimidated into voting for mr. mugabe's governing zanu-pf party. in harare, zimbabwe's opposition movement for democratic change (mdc), whose leader morgan tsvangirai had challenged mr. mugabe, praised the commonwealth for taking concrete action. in canada, the opposition parties were highly critical of the commonwealth, saying it should have suspended zimbabwe indefinitely until mr. mugabe holds free and fair elections. canada must push for punitive action against mr. mugabe and his band of thugs that have brutalized the people of zimbabwe, which means an indefinite suspension from the commonwealth, a ban on travel for mugabe's cronies and to freeze their personal assets. mr. mugabe, 78, led zimbabwe to independence from britain in 1980 and ruled a country that was seen as a great hope for prosperity until the last few years, when the economy has collapsed. at least 150 people have died and tens of thousands left homeless in attacks backed by mr. mugabe's government.
