10 - a c-17 globemaster cargo plane carrying 20 heavily guarded taliban and al qaeda prisoners left a marine corps base in southern afghanistan today on its way to the united states naval base at guantanamo bay, cuba, the first wave of hundreds of detainees who will be held there. the pentagon provided few details about the flight, but senior military officials said more than 40 specially trained military police officers guarded the prisoners on the flight, which was expected to make one stop before reaching cuba, possibly as early as friday morning. pentagon officials said some prisoners might also be sedated during the more-than-20-hour flight, but it was not clear whether that had happened. amnesty international issued a statement today saying that sedating prisoners or shackling them for an entire flight would violate international standards prohibiting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. but he defended the use of strong measures, saying the pentagon had closely studied violent uprisings by taliban and al qaeda prisoners held in the northern afghan city of mazar- i-sharif and in pakistan. military officials also said john walker lindh, the american who was captured with taliban forces near mazar-i-sharif, was not among the prisoners transferred today. american forces in afghanistan were holding a total of 371 prisoners today, including 351 at kandahar and 19 at bagram air base north of kabul.
