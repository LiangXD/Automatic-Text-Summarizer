's big defense and automotive electronics unit, gm hughes electronics, said net income fell 22% in the third quarter, reflecting declining military spending and slumping gm vehicle production. the earnings drop at gm hughes electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of hughes aircraft co. and gm's north american automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the delco electronics corp. side of the gm hughes unit. in addition, gm's north american vehicle production fell 8.4% from a year ago, which hurt delco electronic's earnings, a company spokesman said. in the nine months, gm hughes net fell 6.6% to $486.6 million, or $1.48 a share, from $521 million, or $1.58 a share. in the first nine months, gmac's earnings fell 8% to $859.5 million from $930.2 million. revenue from non-gm accounts was 45% of eds's total business in the latest nine months, compared with 40% a year earlier. the company has said it wants to boost non-gm revenue to at least 50% of its total business by the end of 1990.
