it would put them six points clear at the top of european group two with home games against their main challengers still to come. three well-taken goals and three valuable points but still room for improvement against a polish team which also came close to upsetting england at wembley and who give nothing away on their home turf. _ poland will be a difficult side to play against but if we go there and play with the same attitude that we showed tonight , then things should go well , _ said stefano eranio after the moldova match. in group one , croatia can go top if they beat pointless slovenia in split and leaders greece slip up against bosnia in sarajevo. the bosnians , meanwhile , are bubbling with confidence about the prospect of playing in front of 40,000 at the kosevo olympic stadium. _ i think i_ 'll get a goal and we_ 'll win the match , _ said captain meho kodro. group four throws together the two leaders as scotland , 2-0 winners over estonia on saturday , look to consolidate their place at the top with a win over austria in glasgow. bulgaria can leapfrog israel and russia to take over at the top of group five if they beat cyprus in sofia. romania will stay top of group eight if they beat lithuania in vilnius although the republic of ireland can keep up the pressure with a good result from their trip to macedonia.
