zanu pf readies for war by basildon peta special projects editor 10/18/01 9:43:45 pm (gmt +2) zimbabwe is amassing huge quantities of arms and ammunition using two african allies in preparation for next year's crucial presidential election, it has been established. financial gazette investigations in the past one-and-a-half months have revealed that the democratic republic of the congo (drc) and namibia are helping zimbabwe circumvent an international arms embargo to buy huge quantities of guns and bullets for next year's ballot. most of the guns have been arriving secretly at suri suri airbase in chegutu before they are distributed to other military bases and some will be sent to farms where self-styled war veterans have established bases to intimidate voters. the weapons consist of a significant portion of french-made guns, most of which top government sources say will be distributed to war veterans who are central to the ruling zanu pf party's re-election strategy in the presidential poll. the sources say zimbabwe, after the massive depletion of its armoury because of its participation in the three-year-old drc war, has been finding it extremely difficult to replenish its arms stocks because its traditional and cheaper arms suppliers in europe are refusing to sell it arms. asked why weapons of french origin were finding their way into zimbabwe in an interview last month, jerome sautier, the first counsellor at the french embassy in harare, and lieutenant colonel dault, the defence attache, said france was not selling any arms to zimbabwe. the first secretary at the namibian high commission in harare, mati jose, said he had no knowledge of namibia helping zimbabwe to bust the arms embargo while the drc's ambassador to zimbabwe mawapanga mwanananga could not be reached for comment.
