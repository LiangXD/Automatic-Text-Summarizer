after months of fear and intimidation, zimbabweans streamed to the polls this weekend in record numbers to cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago. the government slashed the number of polling stations in urban areas where the mdc is favored, while boosting the number in rural ruling-party strongholds. rural bindura had 41 polling stations for a smaller number of people. the question foremost in the minds of most zimbabweans is whether attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last- minute election-law changes, and outright fraud have succeeded. an increasing number of local election monitors and international observers say the vote rigging has been so thorough that hopes for a free election are dead. the main cheating took place long before election days, says brian murphy of the zimbabwe citizens support group, an organization whose members spread around the country this weekend privately monitoring the elections. mugabe is trying to move the goal posts to disenfranchise people, these people he thinks will vote against him, said tsvangirai, visiting one polling station where thousands waited angrily to cast their votes, waving their hands in the open-handed signal of the mdc.
