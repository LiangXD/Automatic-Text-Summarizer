last week alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, according to estimates by dalbar financial services inc., a boston research firm. in the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, dalbar says. their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months. some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices. if the heavy outflows continue, fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead. fidelity's junk fund has fallen 2.08% this year through oct. many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues, such as rjr nabisco, to raise cash to meet expected redemptions.
