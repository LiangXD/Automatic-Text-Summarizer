pakistan rejects us human rights report islamabad - pakistan tuesday slated us state department's country report on human rights situation in pakistan and labelled it factually inaccurate and unwarranted. the report fails to acknowledge the important policy measures and initiatives by the government of pakistan to promote and protect human rights, a foreign office spokesman said. the spokesman said that the us report ignored the implementation of almost all initiatives announced and set at an april 2000 human rights conference. the spokesman said: the government has amended pakistan citizenship act of 1951 to enable women of pakistani descent to claim pakistani nationality for their children born to foreign husbands. the spokesman said that despite these developments, the report states 'the govt's human rights record remained poor'. the government of pakistan, therefore, feels constrained to reject the assessment of the report about pakistan, and the tendency of some states to sit in judgement over others. he said that the government of pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and will welcome the assistance of friendly countries towards that end.
