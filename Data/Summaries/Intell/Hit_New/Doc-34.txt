the reluctance of uk authorities to sanction their release ? for such agricultural purposes as extending the range of plants which harbour nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their roots ? is understandable. there are so many bacteria everywhere that picking out a gem is a_bit like looking for a candle amongst blackpool '_ s illumination. a second problem is that many bacteria living & bquo in the wild & equo are not always easy to culture in the laboratory. the gene is very uncommon in nature so any intense yellow colonies of bacteria isolated from the wild ? and cultured ? are almost certainly the lost gems. once you have the gems on the polystyrene spheres they can be washed off and cultured for testing with catechol or other techniques. this research , to enable identification of a released gem ? and its whereabouts ? is essential because_of the risks involved in letting gems out_of the laboratory. there are concerns that , once released , gems might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria.
