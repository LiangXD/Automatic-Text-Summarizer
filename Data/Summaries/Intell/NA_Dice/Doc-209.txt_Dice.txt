China has considered Taiwan a renegade province since 1949 and has threatened to bring it back by force if it continues to indefinitely refuse proposals for "peaceful reunification."Zhang said: "The remarks of the US official are a ... violation of US commitments made (on Taiwan) and interference in China internal affairs.Wolfowitz expressed concern about China's continuing deployment of forces and tactical missiles to areas across the straits from Taiwan.US officials denied Wolfowitz's remarks reflected a change in US policy on Taiwan."China has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the United States and Taiwan," Zhang said.The visit, if Beijing allows it, is widely expected to be centered on China's dissatisfaction over the Taiwan issue."The United States is committed to doing whatever it takes to help Taiwan defend itself," said Wolfowitz, echoing President George W. Bush's remarks made when he first took office last year.
