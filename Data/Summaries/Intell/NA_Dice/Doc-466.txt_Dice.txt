We expect the World Community to take a step toward referring the Israeli criminals of war to the permanent tribunal for war crimes.The Israeli government is committing crimes of war against the Palestinians and should be tried by an international tribunal just like the governments of Rwanda and former Yugoslavia.The Palestinian people and the entire Arab World are waiting for a proof that international law protects human beings in general regardless of their color, ethnicity and religion.
