Suspended in water , only the GEM for which the antibodies were specific will attach to the beads .There are so many bacteria everywhere that picking out a GEM is a_bit like looking for a candle amongst Blackpool '_ s illumination .Once you have the GEMs on the polystyrene spheres they can be washed off and cultured for testing with catechol or other techniques .Engineering a time delayed & bquo ; lethal gene & equo ; into a GEM to give it a finite life ?This GEM ?Their method has been designed for recovering a GEM from water ?are almost certainly the lost GEMs .could suddenly produce a GEM with some nasty trick up its sleeve .This research , to enable identification of a released GEM ?It '_ s not the only way of checking for C230 .is essential because_of the risks involved in letting GEMs out_of the laboratory .There are concerns that , once released , GEMs might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria .The researchers have devised a suite of methods based on detecting a marker gene engineered into the GEM .So mt-2 '_ s purified pili and flagellae were injected into animals so that they rapidly produced antibodies specific to them .Link: [Comments: zero anaphor of GEMS]To develop a recovery method , Morgan , Saunders and Pickup used a Gem called Pseudomonas putida mt-2 , a modified common soil bacterium which may have wide applications for destroying toxic substances .A second problem is that many bacteria living & bquo ; in the wild & equo ; are not always easy to culture in the laboratory .The beads plus GEM are recovered with a magnet .by making a GEM both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ?But losing GEMs could have much farther reaching implications .of very many different species ?But the snag is that first you have to be able to recover the GEMs to culture them to do the catechol yellowing test .The reluctance of UK Authorities to sanction their release ?They '_ ve used one that codes for an enzyme called catechol 2,3-dioxygenase ( C230 for short ) .GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital .The gene is very uncommon in nature so any intense yellow colonies of bacteria isolated from the wild ?As a result , it '_ s been estimated that not many more than one per_cent can be cultured at any one time .But none of these tricks can insure against a mutation .
