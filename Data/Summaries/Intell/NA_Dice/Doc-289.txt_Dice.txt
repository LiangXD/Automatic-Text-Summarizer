US begins flying Afghan prisoners to Cuba WASHINGTON: The US military on Thursday began flying al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners under heavy guard from Afghanistan to jail at the American Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a military spokesman said.A US Marine spokesman in Kandahar told CNN late on Thursday that the gunfire came from snipers that penetrated the outer perimeter of the base and was not believed to be linked to the transfer of prisoners.The convention sets out the rights and responsibilities of war prisoners and their guards.Rumsfeld told reporters on Thursday that every effort would be made to secure hardline prisoners, many considered dangerous and possibly suicidal followers of Bin Laden.Hundreds of US military police and Marine Corps reinforcements have been flown to the "Gitmo" base, as it is called, in Cuba and prisoners will be held inside a compound ringed by two fences topped with razor wire.Lowell said some small-arms fire was directed at US troops on the Kandahar base after the aircraft took off in the early evening Afghanistan time, but that the C-17 was not fired upon.In Washington, US defense officials earlier said that unprecedented security -- including chains and possibly sedation and hoods -- might be used in transporting the prisoners, who include members of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda guerrilla network.He declined to say when the first prisoners might arrive at facilities surrounded by razor wire at the US Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay."The aircraft had departed earlier when the Marines at the operating base received fire.'Willing to kill themselves, others': "There are among these prisoners people who are perfectly willing to kill themselves and kill other people," Rumsfeld added.US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters that major security precautions were being taken in moving the prisoners, including hard-line, anti-Western followers of fugitive guerrilla leader Osama Bin Laden.The US military has so far taken control of more than 300 prisoners at a base in Kandahar and others at Bagram air base near Kabul, at Mazar-i-Sharif and aboard the Navy helicopter assault ship USS Bataan in the northern Indian Ocean.The human rights advocacy group Amnesty International expressed concern about reports that the prisoners "may be drugged, hooded and shackled," saying that they must be treated with full respect for international standards.
