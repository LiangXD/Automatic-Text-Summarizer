At Goodwill, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day: A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients: "You can earn the money to support yourself and your family," she says.While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us.Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center, a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs.Just like the impact Goodwill's work has on our community.These people and their successes are real.Your support helps provide real solutions.On his way home, he shares the story with four people at a street corner.
