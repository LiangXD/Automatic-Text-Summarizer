Amnesty International issued a press release accusing the United States of "keeping prisoners incommunicado, (using) sensory deprivation, the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them" in an effort to 'break' the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation."As for the "unnecessary restraint," one detainee has announced that he wants to kill an American before he leaves Cuba, and another detainee bit a guard, according to Pentagon spokesman Capt.You could understand the outrage if the U.S. military were torturing or otherwise mistreating the detainees.AFTER SPENDING months in frigid Afghanistan caves subsisting on Allah knows what, the 158 detainees the United States is holding in tropical Guantanamo Bay must think they've died and gone to heaven.Instead, Amnesty International and the comrades are outraged that the military is treating al Qaeda captives like prisoners.Yet, some Americans and Brits have been hollering about the U.S. treatment of these tough guys.Does Amnesty International think that wearing a hood on an airplane is sensory deprivation, instead of a security measure?"Torture!" and "Monstrous Inhumanity," while stories say prisoners are treated "like wild beasts" in "cages."The detainee status however, gives the U.S. military the leeway to interrogate these former operatives about any future terrorist attacks.Then there's the status of the detainees.
