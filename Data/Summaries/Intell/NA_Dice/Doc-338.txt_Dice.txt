Cubans celebrate Venezuelan president's return to power, compare botched coup to Bay of Pigs HAVANA - (AP) -- Thousands of Cubans celebrated Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's return to power at a rally Tuesday, likening the failed coup against the Cuban ally to the disastrous U.S.-backed effort to overthrow Fidel Castro's government 41 years ago.Both Castro and Chavez are leftists who see themselves as revolutionary leaders.He said it was a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came so soon after Venezuelans "have written a page of dignity and honor by going out into the streets to overthrow the coup attempt."
