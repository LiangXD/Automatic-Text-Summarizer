Let me pause only briefly to allow that America is imperfect, like all earthly things; that its governments and people have committed many sins; that might does not make right; that power and wealth are not good in themselves; that goodness, truth and beauty may be found in every country and town.For while the "left" has compounded anti-Americanism into dogma, the "right" in Canada, Europe and beyond, participates in the envy of U.S. success.And while the conventional and verbal anti-Americanism is in a different league from the terrorist strikes -- closer to hypocrisy than to murderous hatred -- I think the two are animated by a common cause: a cause to be sought in the murk of the individual human soul, not in the externals of political argument.In the column I wrote on the very day of the September catastrophe, I touched upon the envy of America, which I believed to be its "root cause."From British lords down to humble skinheads, sneering at the American "vulgarity" confers a comforting sense of personal and national vindication, when no other prop can be found.Again and again, I have discovered it is a simple prejudice, rather than a product of comprehensive reasoning: for the charges brought against those "damn Yankees" shift loosely between the U.S. polity and people, and are no sooner effectively rebutted than more charges come forward in their place.The targets in this conflict are the common enemy of all civilized men and women, regardless of race, colour or creed; and the magnitude of the threat they pose was revealed to the world on the morning of Sept.In the words of one, "I can't believe anyone would sacrifice themselves and many others over something as petty as envy."To be fair, so far as truth can be discerned from polls, the free Western world is indeed grateful, and on balance quite supportive of the cause the Americans are leading.Author: David Warren WASHINGTON - On the face of things, it is hard to see how any reasonable person could object to the "war" the United States is now waging against international terrorism and terrorist regimes.The world's most prominent self-styled "Palestinian refugee," Edward Said, is the perfect example of this: a man who would be nothing without the chic and prestige conferred by elite U.S. universities and the publishing institutions of New York, N.Y.
