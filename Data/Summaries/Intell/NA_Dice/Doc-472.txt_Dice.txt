Hence one can see that it is not to be surprised that the United States chimed in with the Venezuela's coup organizers.According to US news media, that coup in Venezuela had something to do with the United States.Why didn't the United States inform Venezuela's constitutional government of the coup attempt by Rincon and the others?Coup d'etat is an unusual means to seize a country's political power.States "supports democracy" and that "we in no way would support any coups or unconstitutional activity."This is far out of tune with the attitude the United States used to take when a coup occurred in other countries.After taking the Office of Presidency, Chavez has implemented an independent foreign policy and seemed to be not in step with the United States in many respects.
