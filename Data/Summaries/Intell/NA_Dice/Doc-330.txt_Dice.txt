No opinion polls have been taken, but talk radio, a popular medium that politicians use as a barometer of national opinion, is running slightly against him, according to the media monitoring agency Rehame Australia.Mr. Williams says "neither the US nor Australia is in a position to begin a prosecution against Hicks," acknowledging that he may not have committed any offenses under Australian law.The US government classifies the men as "illegal combatants," not prisoners of war, and therefore they don't have the rights laid out in the Geneva Convention.Mr. Hicks is one of a handful of Westerners - including three British fighters - who fought with the Taliban and Al Qaeda.Opposition justice spokesman Darryl Melham says the Australian government's refusal to demand consular access to its citizen compares poorly with British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's immediate insistence that three British nationals captured with Al Qaeda should face neither a military tribunal nor the death penalty.Not only has Australia's opposition Labor Party called for Hicks, currently held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to be returned home, but a Supreme Court justice has described Hicks as "a casualty" of his own government's attempt to maintain favor in Washington."The Australian government is, frankly, pathetic in that, for the argument of convenience, we are letting this man be held in conditions that clearly violate established conventions on the treatment of prisoners."If Hicks and other foreign captives receive markedly different treatment to Walker, even though all men served the same Taliban, Melham predicts damage to the international coalition against terrorism."The Americans seem to have retreated from an earlier position of the death penalty for foreigners, but we are still worried about the extent to which this guy's legal rights are being subjugated to the Australian government's shuttle diplomacy with the US."But the detention by US forces of Australian Taliban fighter David Hicks has provoked tensions that could fray the bilateral goodwill.
