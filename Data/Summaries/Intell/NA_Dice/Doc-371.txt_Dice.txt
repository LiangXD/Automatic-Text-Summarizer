"The committee has decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate effect," Mr. Howard said, reading the statement alone, apparently as a face-saving gesture to Mr. Mbeki, whose own election observers in Zimbabwe found the vote "legitimate."The move avoids an open rift between its majority members in Africa and Asia, some of which have tended to side with Mr. Mugabe, and rich, white-ruled countries like Britain, Canada and Australia, which have criticized him.According to the statement, the leaders of South Africa and Nigeria will continue to talk to Mr. Mugabe about ways to lift the suspension.The suspension was decided by the three men, who met as a committee charged with deciding the Commomwealth's response.Yet many African politicians, including Morgan Tsvangirai, the Zimbabwe opposition leader defeated in the election, had expressed doubt that the Commonwealth would take any action at all.In the 60's, white-ruled South Africa quit the Commonwealth rather than be suspended over apartheid; Nigeria was suspended in the 1990's during military rule because of the execution of the human rights activist Ken Saro Wiwa.The Commonwealth also supported moves to resolve the country's violent crisis over the seizure of white farmers' land, backing Mr. Mugabe in his commitment to redistribute territory among landless black Zimbabweans.The two African leaders, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, maintained a cryptic silence while Mr. Howard spoke, endorsing the decision by their presence at a news conference but avoiding embroilment in a debate over whether they now view Mr. Mugabe's presidency as illegitimate.
