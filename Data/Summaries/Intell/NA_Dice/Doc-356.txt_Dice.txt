In the eyes of Japan and many US allies, the Bush administration's decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is one of many signals that Washington is growing increasingly unilateralist in the six months since the Sept."It is absolutely inadmissible for the US, which is the greatest gas-emitting country, to once again turn its back and present something that is against Kyoto Protocol and the framework convention on climate change," says Mie Asaoka, president of the Kiko Network, a Tokyo environmental-umbrella organization representing about 150 Japanese groups.During Mr. Bush's visit here last month, Mr. Koizumi gently balked at the president's proposed alternative to the Kyoto agreement, saying that Japan would "like to see further efforts" on the part of the US.They fear that, because the US is forging its own way, smaller nations that are expected to ratify the Kyoto Protocol could start backing out.Not everyone in Japan is upset with Bush's alternative.The Bush administration is offering its own alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, which aides say are more market-sensitive and will reduce the worst air pollutants by 70 percent while finding a strategy to cut greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent over the next 10 years.For Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, the shaping of the accord on their soil was a source of pride - and proof that they were still relevant players on the world stage.At no time was it clearer that countries should take steps to slow this process than when 150 countries signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.After the Earth Summit of 10 years ago, he says, Japan discussed and implemented a self-action plan to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions.
