The 1998 warrant charged that Bin-Ladin, a Saudi billionaire housed as a "guest" in Afghanistan, was involved in the 1994 murder of two Germans in Syrte, Libya.The force, based in Lyon, France, will work non-stop to "help to filter any information coming from Interpol country members," Noble said.Interpol will meet in Budapest from September 24-29, where member countries will discuss methods of bringing those responsible for the attacks to justice, Espigares and Noble said.The two warrants -- from 1998 and 2000 -- were released at a press conference here by Interpol President Jesus Espigares of Spain and Secretary General Ronald K. Noble of the United States.Espigares and Noble also said that Interpol has created a task force, named "September 11," after the date on which two hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City and another hit the Pentagon in Washington, leaving thousands dead.
