It is a message that Mr. Bush's aides said in interviews this week that they hoped would force officials of developing countries and foreign investors to work out their problems without relying as much on huge aid packages from the International Monetary Fund and from Washington, which became commonplace after Mexico.Both the I.M.F. and the United States, the fund's largest shareholder, have come under some sharp criticism for denying new loans to Argentina after previously approving aid to the country.The hard line on Argentina, White House and Treasury officials say, was calculated to send the message that under the Bush administration, the United States would be a reluctant financial firefighter and that the markets should not bet on a bailout.And some argue that both the Clinton and Bush administrations should have acted sooner to steer Argentina away from its doomed efforts to defend a 1-to-1 peg of its peso to the dollar.Some longtime critics of the fund applauded the Bush administration's stance.Already there is considerable doubt that Argentina will now agree to the kind of hemispheric free-trade agreement that Mr. Bush himself, with Mr. de la R? his side, said last year was a major goal of his administration.When Argentina barreled toward a similar default in recent weeks, it was Mr. Bush who had to make the bailout call - and his decision was to let Argentina suffer the consequences of its own economic mismanagement.There are other new aspects to the Bush policy.Bush's Policy on Argentina Signals Shift in Approach WASHINGTON, Jan.Officials say Mr. O'Neill supported the decision by the I.M.F. to cut off Argentina's loans because it had failed to meet the fund's demands for fiscal restraint.The critics of Mr. Bush's decision to pull the plug on aid argue that the I.M.F. and the Bush administration were callous for abandoning an ally at a sensitive moment.
