Nevertheless, Taiwan heightened its diplomatic campaign through what Wang said was "parliamentarian" or "private diplomacy" to win recognition from Beijing's allies.China's minister in charge of Taiwan affairs says Beijing will not resort to force to defend Taiwan despite the changing situation on the island, which he described as "our renegade province"."Weapons cannot prevent Taiwan from reuniting with China," he told Thai and Chinese media last week.He said Beijing will maintain its pursuit of peaceful unification with Taiwan and welcomed the resumption of dialogue, bogged down since 1999.Wang believes unification will benefit people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.Wang Yi, who made a three-day working visit to Thailand last week, sought to allay fears amongst allies in Asia about its cross-straits ties with Taiwan.While President Chen Shui-bian has mellowed his stance on independence, he has refused to bow to the "one-China policy", a precondition for dialogue.
