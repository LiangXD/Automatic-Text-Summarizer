The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down.So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.Yeah, and at the time, I was also working in the classroom.I think that was the last class I took.I don't, just so I can work in the school I'll be happy.As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, "Have you considered being a teacher assistant?"He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too.But he told me to go ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.If I could just work, even as a teacher assistant I would be happy."I enjoy my job very much.I guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence.And before you know it, the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl's head off.And I enjoy what I do.Well I didn't like writing at the time but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper.All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school.I really don't, I don't remember why that school was ever closed but it was.So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.That was my dream, to teach school.As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.I've only worked at two, two schools.So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.
