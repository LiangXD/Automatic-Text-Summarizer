A simple autonomous agent, say, a bacterium, is a Darwinian creature.The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent say, an early bacterium is somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world.In short, once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere.Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the "doings" of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent.After all, I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment, defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf, then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf.Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier, yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics, intentionality, value, and ethics arise with autonomous agents.Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent.Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents?And the stunning fact directly before us, every day, is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf.What in the world is "know-how" ?Unlike "know that," "know-how" does not involve propositions about the world.From the fact that mothers care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, Hume argued.I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words.Popperian creatures, in Dennett' s fine phrase, have "internal models" of their world and can "run the internal model" with the clutch disengaged, rather than running the model in real time in the real world.Now, five chapters later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter, energy, and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf.If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a useful or more, a proper definition of life itself, then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where "purpose" is ascribed by all of us to one another.Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creature namely, at least humans.On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like F = MA and Darwin' s "natural selection" and "fitness," that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world.I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had, individually and collectively, the embodied know-how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world.If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our tools literally stone knives, arrows, digging sticks, machine tools to enlarge our shared world of facts and processes.Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological.But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom "intentionality" and "purpose" are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties.Philosophers distinguish between "know-how" and "know that."This enlarged shared world gives us more know-how, and more know that.And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present?"Know-how" involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world.Stones and chairs are not, by my definition, autonomous agents.The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli, or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around.We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents.Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view.Strange and interesting, is it not, that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise?While fully aware of Hume' s injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent' s perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent.But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how.I cannot buy Shannon' s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent.The incoming molecule is "yuck" or "yum."An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is (i) food; (ii) poison; (iii) a signal; (iv) neutral; (v) something else.There is no autonomous agent, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations.Without invoking consciousness, not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject, it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems, even without evoking nerve cells.Indeed, Hume' s injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements.There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries, to doubt a physics of semantics.
