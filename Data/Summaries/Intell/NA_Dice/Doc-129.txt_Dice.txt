In the field of satellite communications, Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) spent $310 million to develop the ETS-8 (Engineering Test Satellite 8) satellite.However, these two rockets are primarily used to launch low orbit satellites.Japan is determined to become a major power in aerospace.Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development.In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies.Japan has prepared a military space program and allocated $1.3 billion to implement it.Japan also has a huge space power plant plan.This low cost approach brought about a series of satellite launch failures."Lunar A," one of the major projects, is aimed at delivering two penetrators on the moon to collect various data.Between 1970 and the end of 1999, Japan launched a total of 66 satellites.In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket.This satellite doubled the capacity of the test satellite previously launched by Japan.
