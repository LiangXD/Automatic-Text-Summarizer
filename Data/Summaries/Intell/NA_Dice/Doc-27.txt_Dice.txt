& bquo ; Whatever the Government '_ s idea is , I do n't think that '_ s it , somehow . & equo ;& equo ; The end result is that Dr Jones takes on overseas researchers . & bquo ; That '_ s fine as far as I am concerned & equo ; he says . & bquo ; They do n't cost British industry or taxpayers a thing , but of_course they take all their expertise abroad .But while rising demand , high prices and fast growth provide the stimulus , the prawn '_ s life-cycle presents many problems for the would-be farmer .Dr Eric Edwards of the Shellfish Association says : & bquo ; Customer reaction is that they are stylish and upmarket . & equo ; Demand in Europe and North America continues to rise by 4 per_cent a year $- despite the fact that natural sources are already overfished .& bquo ; It '_ s exactly the same , essentially , as making nylon , & equo ; he says . & bquo ; To do that , you take a_lot_of identical molecules called amines and join them together to form a chain .& bquo ; Once we had solved the thickness problem , it became a commercial possibility , & equo ; says Dr Jones , & bquo ; and Mars ?We '_ ve learnt an enormous amount because the microcapsule is such an ideal tool for simplifying and controlling food intake . & equo ; Dr Jones and his team are now extending their work to other species , and to the post-larval stage , which leads to the ultimate product ?& bquo ; Haemoglobin , chicken egg and many other natural proteins are rich in the important chemical groups , and these cross-link without any problem at all .A team of scientists from the distinctly untropical environment of the University College of North Wales in Bangor has solved some of these problems by designing food fit for a prawn to eat .A team led by Dr David Jones , of Bangor '_ s renowned School of Ocean Sciences , designed a revolutionary new feed , using a process called microencapsulation which puts a thin , digestible membrane around each tiny food particle .& bquo ; Through refining our feed , by leaving things out and seeing what happens , we have been able to define the dietary requirements of the prawn throughout its development .& bquo ; Frippak support our work generously , & equo ; he says . & bquo ; But they are understandably reluctant to pay for research students , because they will probably go off and join the competition .& bquo ; It '_ s a real Catch 22 situation .& bquo ; Now if , instead_of having a single interface between the two liquids , you emulsify the two ( like oil and vinegar in French dressing ) the reaction occurs over the surface of each suspended droplet , creating a capsule . & equo ; Originally , the team mixed prawn nutrients with amines , thinking that they would be needed to form the capsule .Developing the diet has had great scientific spin-offs . & bquo ; It '_ s amazing that a multi-million pound industry was built on an animal nobody knew anything about , & equo ; Dr Jones says . & bquo ; We have 50 years of data on the chicken or the pig .The project '_ s got alpha ratings , but the council saw the industrial involvement and said & bquo ; Go to industry ?& bquo ; We know how fast food moves through its gut , how much energy it takes to make one post-larval prawn from the day it hatches , and_so_on .Traditionally , prawn farmers have trapped these young adults ( or & bquo ; post-larvae & equo ; as they are called ) and put them into ponds .But Dr Jones '_ s involvement with industry has led him into difficulties ?we '_ re short_of money & equo ; .prawn hatcheries ?though I still find the teaching and research spin-offs the most exciting part of it all , & equo ; says Dr Jones .In the past , hatcheries have had to rely on live feed , which is as unreliable and expensive to harvest from nature as it is to grow artificially .Ideally , farmers would like to grow the larvae from eggs , and so a new industry ?& bquo ; When you put the two together , the cross-linking reaction occurs , and all the amine molecules at the interface of the two liquids join together in a polymer .From a modest 1,000 tonnes a year in the early 1970s , the world '_ s prawn farms are expected to produce 440,000 tonnes by 1990 .Once you get working with industry , there '_ s a feeling that industry must pay for everything .& bquo ; That did n't work either .
