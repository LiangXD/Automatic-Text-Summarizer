Mission Control's officials also stated that this unplanned space walk would be conducted in order to repair the malfunction, which had appeared in the docking unit during the docking of the Russian Progress M1-7 cargo space ship.The space walk period will decrease if they successfully remove the object located in the gap between the ship and the docking unit.According to the Russian Mission Control, the space walk may last from 3 to 6 hours because of the mission's difficulty.Experts believe that the 4mm gap between the ship and the station's docking unit has been caused by an object, which now prevents the tight joining of the two space vehicles.
