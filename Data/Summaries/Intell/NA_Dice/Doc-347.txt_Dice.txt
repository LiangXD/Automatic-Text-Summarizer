Zhang said: "The remarks of the US official are a ... violation of US commitments made (on Taiwan) and interference in China internal affairs.China has considered Taiwan a renegade province since 1949 and has threatened to bring it back by force if it continues to indefinitely refuse proposals for "peaceful reunification."Wolfowitz expressed concern about China's continuing deployment of forces and tactical missiles to areas across the straits from Taiwan.BEIJING: China on Thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the United States and Taiwan, demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to US weapons sales."China has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the United States and Taiwan," Zhang said.The visit, if Beijing allows it, is widely expected to be centered on China's dissatisfaction over the Taiwan issue.US officials denied Wolfowitz's remarks reflected a change in US policy on Taiwan."The continual sale of arms by the United States or upgrading of relations with Taiwan will only lead to tensions across the straits," foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said.
