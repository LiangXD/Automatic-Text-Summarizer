Although he called current market conditions "highly competitive," Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year.Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg.The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project.Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%.Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume.The company has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year.General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity."I don't think Kellogg can get back to 40% this year," he said.Kellogg is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources say.Kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market.The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions.
