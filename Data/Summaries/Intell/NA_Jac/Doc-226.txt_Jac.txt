A report about settlement activity in Palestinian territories has confirmed that 36 new settlement sites--settlement enclaves--have been created since Sharon became Prime Minister of Israel less than a year ago.The report highlighted the damage caused to the agricultural sector as a result of settlement activity.He said: "There are two grave violations, the first concerns settlement building and the transfer of settlers to the Palestinian territories on which tens of settlements have been built.The report also noted that work on bypass roads continued at a rate faster than that of the government of Barak who gave free rein to settlement activities.The second is Israel's enacting of laws that facilitate expropriating Palestinian land and settlement activity, a matter that is considered among the war crimes."He indicated that settlements have emerged as military bastions and bases for launching attacks against Palestinians during the intifadah.He stressed the need to concentrate on resisting settlement activity, settlers and their militias, and abstaining from subjecting this file to any discussion as a condition for halting the intensified settlement activities and removing existing settlements.In the Gaza Strip 1,051 donums were annexed to existing settlements, 32 new housing units were built, and work on 190 additional units was started.In addition, 102 mobile caravans were added to settlements and new settlement sites and more than 705 donums were added to existing settlements.While a settler who opened fire on a group of Palestinians wounding four of them was sentenced to four years imprisonment by an Israeli court.He explained that the intifadah has proved that the settlement battle is not over.
