Your financial support of the development process is just one step in making CCI a stronger, more efficient and ultimately more effective federation of service providers.The community initiatives committee is working with our development office to put together a long-range fundraising plan that will ultimately bring more money into our centers.I also encourage you to seek additional support through your company, church, or service organization.
