There are many Marthas here, people who marched to ZANU-PF anthems and cheered President Robert Mugabe at rallies, while secretly planning to vote for Mr. Tsvangirai.In rural areas, many polling stations stood empty by midday.An increasing number of local election monitors and international observers say the vote rigging has been so thorough that hopes for a free election are dead.Rural Bindura had 41 polling stations for a smaller number of people.Mugabe is trying to move the goal posts to disenfranchise people, these people he thinks will vote against him," said Tsvangirai, visiting one polling station where thousands waited angrily to cast their votes, waving their hands in the open-handed signal of the MDC.The government slashed the number of polling stations in urban areas where the MDC is favored, while boosting the number in rural ruling-party strongholds.In Kuwadzana, there were seven polling stations for about 55,000 people.The MDC says that 52 percent of its rural polling agents were chased away, abducted, or refused accreditation by government officials, leaving the voting process open to widespread abuse.Now the country's 5.6 million voters are waiting anxiously for the results of the poll to be announced, although the voting, which was supposed to end Sunday, may stretch on for days.He refused, but sent her to talk to the election officers - both of whom represented the ruling ZANU-PF party.After months of fear and intimidation, Zimbabweans streamed to the polls this weekend in record numbers to cast their votes in the country's first contested election since independence 22 years ago.Even as voters went to the polls over the weekend, the intimidation and attempts at rigging continued.Many arrived at overburdened polling stations in the early hours of the morning and waited in the hot sun for the entire day without food.
