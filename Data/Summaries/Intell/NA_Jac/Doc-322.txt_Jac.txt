Lorne Taylor, the Alberta Environment Minister, estimated the costs of Kyoto to the Canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year.Implementing Kyoto would cost a paltry $500-million, he said, and added more ominously that "the issue, technically, is that international relations fall within the purview of the federal government.Last spring the American National Academy of Science warned that because "there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally," any estimates of either the magnitude or the direction of future warming must be highly tentative.In short, because the estimates of the scale and timing of atmospheric warming are so uncertain, it is just not possible to assess the costs and benefits.At the same conference, Taylor's federal counterpart, David Anderson, announced that the Alberta numbers were absurd.Herb Dhaliwal, the federal Energy Minister, weighed in with even more qualifications: "Some important details have to be worked out before Canada ratifies the Kyoto Protocol," he said.The fact is, Kyoto is without principles and no one has a clue what it means.Underlying the uncertainties regarding costs are more fundamental uncertainties about the scientific evidence.Another sign the debate is intensifying emerged last week at a global warming conference in Ottawa.Taylor may have offered a more prudent guess, but the fact is, accurate estimates of the costs of policies designed to reduce selected gas emissions are impossible.
