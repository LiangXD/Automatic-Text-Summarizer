Unfortunately, some leading African countries like South Africa and Nigeria have compounded the problem by accepting Mugabe's victory despite earlier assertions that they would not recognize the results of a rigged election.By failing to hold firm they not only damage their diplomatic credibility, but also ignore the consequences for nearby African states of Mugabe's misrule.Thugs and fraud cannot keep the 78-year-old Mugabe in power forever.It is blessed with fertile agricultural land, and during the first dozen years of Mugabe's rule it was relatively prosperous and free.
