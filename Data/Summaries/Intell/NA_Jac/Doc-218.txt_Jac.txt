Israeli's own 35-year-old occupation and resettlement policies have created the breeding ground for the terrorism that Sharon is now trying to root out by resorting exclusively to military means.Israel's resettlement policies have been justified on the grounds of security.Since Sharon refuses to offer the Palestinians their own state with acceptable borders and conditions, there are two alternatives left.As Israeli tanks push their way into one Palestinian population center after another it has become more and more difficult to guess what political objectives might be driving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.He says he wants to destroy the "infrastructure" behind the suicide attacks against the Israelis.We can understand this as an immediate military objective, but nothing will be achieved by the operation politically.Sharon, of course, will not admit that he is planning anything like this, even though the idea has been discussed in Israel.
