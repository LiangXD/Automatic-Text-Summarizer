It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre.Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967.The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping."Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre.These principles are upheld in the Space Treaty 1967.These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 (Space Treaty 1967), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 (Liability Convention 1972), and finally, the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 (Registration Convention 1974).The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states' space projects.This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case Australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state.Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space.A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim.Therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia's objections."If Australia then denies the claim, we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities.In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station, Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station.The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention.The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour.
