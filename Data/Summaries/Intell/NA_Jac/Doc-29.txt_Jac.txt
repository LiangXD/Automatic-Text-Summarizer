Seeking an ethical watchdog for the genetic scientists By TOM WILKIE IN A RARE display of consensus last week , industry , consumers _' organisations and the environmental movement called for a national committee to examine the social and ethical implications of biotechnology and genetic engineering of plants and animals , Tom Wilkie writes .representatives of consumer interests , environmental groups such as the Green Alliance , and commercial firms such as ICI ?Keith Pike , a manager of ICI Seeds , told the meeting that & bquo ; industry likes to know where it stands .But he opposed any suggestion that representatives of the environmental movement might sit on the technical committees set up_to decide on the safety of any release of genetically manipulated organisms into the environment .The suggestion was supported both by companies involved in biotechnology and by environmental groups .Ann Foster , the council '_ s food policy adviser , said : & bquo ; There should be the equivalent of a Warnock Committee to look at aspects of genetic manipulation other than simply matters of safety . & equo ; The Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology was set up in July 1982 under the chairmanship of Dame Mary Warnock to investigate in_vitro fertilisation and human genetic research .Ms Foster put forward the idea of a similar investigation for plant and animal biotechnology because she was troubled by the unnecessary secrecy and seeming insensitivity of government departments to issues other than the narrow technical one of safety .
