Although he called current market conditions "highly competitive," Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year.Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg.Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%.The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project.Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume.General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity.The company has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year."I don't think Kellogg can get back to 40% this year," he said.The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions.Mr. Maxwell said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills' share increased to 30% or more.Kellogg is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources say.
