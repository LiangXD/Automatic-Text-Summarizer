Russia signed the document three years ago, in March 1999.The Obligations of Foreign Countries Under the Kyoto Protocol Developed countries and transitional economies must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 by at least 5 percent from the recognized baseline year of 1990.The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change.On the agenda of tomorrow's meeting of the Russian government is the question of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol -- a highly important international document that is supposed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.Russia's Obligations Under the Kyoto Protocol They are relatively mild for our country.This approach is based on the fact that Russia's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990, and, according to forecasts, the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years.It was aimed at reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and assigns countries quotas on their emissions.Facts According to estimates by the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Energy, Russia's total carbon-dioxide emissions in 2008-2012 will be 20 percent below the 1990 level.Within the framework of the protocol our country must maintain records of, and monitor, emissions and emission quotas, as well as regulate quotas.That is why carrying out a project and reducing emissions in Russia is far cheaper than in most developed countries.In Russia, up to 98 percent of all emissions of the main greenhouse gas -- CO2 -- come from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas).Our country has something like a controlling block of shares, since without Russia and the US the Kyoto Protocol will die.Some of the participants took the line that this is an extremely useful for Russia, which has "hot air" (that is, it is 30 percent short of the permitted level of CO2 emissions), and the country can become the dominant seller in the market; consequently, it has a greater stake than anyone in the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.In Mr. Gudkov's view, everything is developing well, we can take our time, and we can do nothing at all, since global warming is a threat only to the southern countries.The convention was designed to unite efforts to prevent dangerous climate changes and to achieve a stabilization of the content of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a relatively safe level.American at first signed the document, but a year ago President Bush announced that he would not impose regulations in his country on the discharge of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.Our institute, along with the Institute of Systems Analysis and the Russian Academy of Sciences Computer Center, has begun studying the role of climate change in individual regions of Russia in order to forecast economic development.But the expert urged everyone to despair, "since control of global warming without Russia is impossible; the country is becoming the owner of the controlling block of shares."The problem is that the present stage of study of small climatic models has scientists studying the life of the models as the life of a real climatic system.A limitation, rather than reduction, of emissions is specified for several developed countries (New Zealand, Norway), and Australia and Iceland received the right to increase emissions.What is cited as the reason for them, the scientist continues, "is almost always the increase in the greenhouse effect due to a larger concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.For example, Prof. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan maintain that "we must not speak of warming, but of global climatic changes; warming is merely one aspect of these changes."A consensus was arrived at that climate has always changed, but it has never occurred with such speed.Russia is third in the world in total emissions -- after the US and China.As of today, more than 80 nations (all the developed countries and almost all of the CIS countries) have signed the Kyoto Protocol, and almost 40 have ratified it.This means that Russia will be able to offer the carbon market emission quotas of up to 3 billion tons.Background The Ecological-Economic Meaning of the Kyoto Protocol This is the first international document that makes use of the market mechanism as an approach to solving global ecological problems.Rumor has it that the late author of the greenhouse model told Academician Roald Sagdeyev: "I'm a little uneasy when I tell the Americans about my model, because it suggests that Russia's agriculture will gain from global warming, while America's agriculture will lose."Participants in the debate also proceeded from the postulate that the earth's atmosphere has been heating up over the past 100 years.And now Andrey Gudkov, an expert at the Center for Strategic Studies, follows Budyko in insisting that Russia, as well as Canada and Alaska, gain, since "lands situated in a condition of permafrost will gradually turn into fertile soils for agricultural production."Russia has quite a lot of low-lying areas, such as St. Petersburg.The world community became hopeful that it would be possible to solve the problems that brought about the UN Convention on Climate Change (1994).A total of 186 nations are parties to the convention, including Russia, all of the developed countries and all of the CIS countries.The US, Japan and members of the EU must reduce emissions by 7, 6 and 8 percent from the 1990 level.
