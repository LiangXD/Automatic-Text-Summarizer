This committee is scheduled to start the debate on the Senate's euthanasia bill today.Moreover, the Chamber's justice committee seems to want to go it alone regarding the euthanasia debate.The Chamber will treat the bill differently than the Senate, which worked with a joint justice and public health committee.It will discuss the bills on euthanasia and palliative care that the Senate approved in the autumn of 2001.
