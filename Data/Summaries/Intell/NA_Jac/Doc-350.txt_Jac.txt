If the rate of increase in greenhouse gases had been maintained at the peak reached in 1980, the climate by 2050 would have reached temperatures not currently anticipated until 2100, when CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere are expected to have doubled, the researchers calculate.The slowdown also "is due in part to the slower growth of methane and carbon dioxide, for reasons that aren't well understood and need more study," notes James Hansen, the NASA researcher who conducted the study with Makiko Sato, also with the GISS.It's not another ice age, but at least it's cooler As countries gear up for battles over ratifying the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a recent study suggests that the world already has stepped along the path to a future cooler than it might have been.The duo calculates that by reducing methane emissions by 30 percent, for example, the effect on climate would be comparable to the effect from cuts in CO 2 envisioned by the Kyoto Protocol during its first commitment period, which runs from 2008 to 2012.
