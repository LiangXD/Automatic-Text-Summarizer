The criteria set by Rice are the following: the three countries in question are repressive and grave human rights violators, and aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction.One can name more than a dozen countries which are contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one speed or another.Come to think of it, acquiring weapons of mass destruction per se may not be a correct basis for judging whether a nation is good or evil.All other countries which are seemingly refraining from acquiring such weapons are doing so not so much to escape being branded as "evil" but rather because they have neither the knowledge nor the money to join the "nuclear club".This is, in fact, the fear of all countries, as they feel that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction.
