Powell's words, "we are working on this plan," are unclear, because he did not say what the plan is, and Israel's call for a conference on the Middle East is also unclear.It is worrying that among Powell's priorities in Beirut were the talks on the activities of the Hezbolah, with an announcement that terrorists might open a new front.Europe does not have a united stance on the violence in Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem, and the Palestinian refugee camps, despite the clear situation that Israel is the only country in the world that secures its borders by occupying territories of another state.The impression is that, under US sponsorship, the international community deliberated too long about the violence in the Middle East.Israel did not even have the goodness to look at this plan, demonstrating arrogance toward everything Arab.
