The green development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol opens the way for businesses from industrialized countries to pay for the introduction of more environmentally-friendly technology in polluting industries in developing countries.Regardless of what Norway and other countries manage to do in this respect, we must prepare ourselves for climate changes.The government wants to play an active role internationally but we should also work on reducing emissions here at home.Initiatives between now and 2008: The government wants to show demonstrable progress in the reduction of climate emissions by 2005."The government wants to point to a significant reduction of climate gate emissions before 2005 after Norway has ratified the Kyoto Protocol in the course of the year," Environmental Protection Minister Borge Brende has written.For later periods, sharper reductions are necessary and there is also the need to get more countries to take on climate obligations.According to the United Nations' climate panel, in the next 10 to 20 years changes in the climate will be almost unaffected by what we do in the way of initiatives in the next few years to reduce emissions of climate gases.The possibility of cooperating with other countries' early quota systems.North Norway will also get more precipitation in the fall but warmer temperatures in the winter.There is consensus that a broad quota system with international quota exchange should be used to achieve our emission responsibilities during the first obligatory period, 2008-2012.All the world's countries and peoples are affected by climate changes but it is the poor countries that are being hit the hardest.How should we prepare ourselves for more and bigger floods?In the government's work to put the quota system into shape in Norway, we are now discussing a number of problems.Businesses that are obligated by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quotas they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions.I am pleased that there now seems to be broad political consensus that in Norway as well we should get under way with an early quota system.Regardless of the shape of the measures in Norway, Norwegian businesses as well ought to contribute to reducing emissions in poor countries.The government wants to set the stage for Norway to ratify the Kyoto Protocol next year.Even if developing countries have contributed to these climate problems to just a slight degree, they will nevertheless bear the greatest burden.
