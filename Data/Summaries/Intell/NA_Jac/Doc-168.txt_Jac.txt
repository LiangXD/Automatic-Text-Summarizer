It mainly requires the joint effort of industrialized nations to resolve global warming.He indicated that there is a long way to go and a great deal of effort to put in before global warming can be successfully arrested.Dr. Ren Guoyu, an expert meteorologist at the National Climate Center of China, pointed out that the Kyoto Protocol was only the first step to resolve global warming during his interview with Xinhua News Agency.Fundamentally, the targets set by the Kyoto Protocol are far less than what actually will take to effectively curb global warming.As a reminder, Dr. Ren pointed out: The Kyoto Protocol is merely a gesture for mankind to stop global warming.This disaster can only be averted if we all join in to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to stop global warming.This excessive emission of greenhouse gases has caused the mean global temperature to rise by 0.4 to 0.8 degree C in the past 140 years.If emission of greenhouse gases is not rigorously limited and is allowed to continue to climb, then the average global temperature may surge by 1.5 to 5.8 C.To implement the Kyoto Protocol, according to Dr. Ren, usually a country would incur an economic loss equivalent to 1 percent of its GDP when it tries to lower greenhouse emissions 1 percent.This increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by industrialized nations.Mankind should continue to work on a solution to global warming.
