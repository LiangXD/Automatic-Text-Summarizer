"If sanctions are imposed on Zimbabwe, it will not survive.MDC leader Tsvangirai at it again in South Africa Herald Reporter OPPOSITION youths are agitating to get guns to "shoot" President Mugabe "out of office," MDC leader, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai said in South Africa yesterday.Mr Tsvangirai endorsed a United States proposal for targeted sanctions against President Mugabe and members of his Government but said full economic sanctions would be a ruinous mistake."Until such time as Mugabe actually subverts the electoral process - when one goes to that extreme, international sanctions will be an option.The superior court has since heard State and defence arguments on the legality of the charges being laid against the opposition leader and reserved judgment.But analysts expressed concern that the MDC leader is "flirting with mercenaries in South Africa".Charges against the MDC leader arose after he allegedly told a crowd at the party's first anniversary last year that "...If the Supreme Court rules in favour of Mr Tsvangirai, who if convicted on the charges might face life imprisonment, the Attorney General's Office will have to draw up a new charge.Speaking in an address to the Cape Town Press club, Mr Tsvangirai, who is on a visit to South Africa, was quoted by Reuters as saying he was having to "rein in militants keen to fight President Mugabe's rule".
