& bquo ; To a farmer it '_ s an anathema not to produce on his land and therefore it '_ s not that he is not being responsible in meeting the challenges . & equo ; Many farmers , it turns out , would n't in the least object to making the countryside ?Conservationists , farmers and government agencies all agree that there is an opportunity right_now for debate and then decision .Either way , the countryside changes .To a farmer it '_ s anathema not to produce on land .Some farmers are likely to achieve this by converting to organic farming .His land could tumble down to scrub and nettles and eventually untidy woodland .It is called & bquo ; set aside . & equo ; A proportion of the farm ?There are also emotional objections . & bquo ; We wish to see as many farmers as possible occupying the countryside , & equo ; said Melinda Appleby . & bquo ; We want to see a working countryside and we do n't want to see it fossilised so it '_ s almost like a theme park . & equo ; Farmers have higher hopes of the & bquo ; extensification & equo ; programme in the wings .There is a Ministry proposal called & bquo ; extensification . & equo ; It means that the whole farm has to produce 20 per_cent less .Both the farmers and the conservationists agree that there ought_to be a debate .together with new land released for development , will barely scratch the surface of the problem .She goes on : & bquo ; The problem with taking a management decision out_of a farmer '_ s hands as an economic decision and putting it into conservationists hands is that the conservationists do n't always agree .She says one fear is that land in the hills will become redundant . & bquo ; These are areas where you could say farming was marginal .plus the Commission '_ s other plan for 100,000 acres of new forest in the Midlands , which will also soak up redundant land ?In the first place , the scheme only operates for five years , with no guarantee of continuation .Under this , farms would have to reduce output by 20 per_cent .So & bquo ; extended & equo ; farms will have to leave a wide strip of unsown soil in each field , and let the hedges grow .There is a big fear in the hills that in_order_to maintain businesses in the lowlands , people will diversify into sheep , and the profitability of sheep in the lowlands will be greater . & equo ; In fact , the Countryside Commission has just announced an imaginative scheme for 12 & bquo ; community forests & equo ; on marginal urban fringe farmland .Or he could sell most of his land to Mr Big and his house and a_few acres could fall into the hands of a merchant banker who wants somewhere quiet with a paddock for the daughter '_ s ponies .& bquo ; People were extremely disappointed that conservationists could not come up with exciting positive solutions for potential land that might come out_of agriculture , & equo ; says Miss Appleby .& bquo ; In the future , it seems , we are going to be taking arbitrary decisions about what we want from the countryside : the large blue here , a certain bird there , and we are going to manage for those species , which will mean that everything_else will go . & equo ; The countryside may be changing .As profitablilty declines , they would go out_of farming .Another problem is that the wildlife lobby is divided even over simple things like the future of old farm woodlands .THE British farmer is about to wander into fresh woods and pastures new .and what will happen as land use goes on changing .For the first time in decades , the nation has a chance to decide what to do with it .Three million acres or more of Britain '_ s countryside ca n't be left to tumble down to nettles , bracken , Oxford ragwort and rosebay willow herb , punctuated by leisure centres and car parks .last year , farm incomes fell by 25 per_cent .more attractive .It depends on what is defined as attractive .more attractive .It depends on what is defined as attractive .He could grow hedges and wildflowers instead_of sugar beet ; he could turn his fields into areas of & bquo ; quiet countryside enjoyment & equo ; ; he could restore ancient coppices and chalk grassland .He could take up agroforestry ; he could convert to timber ; he could take up government agency schemes and grow winter grass mixtures for wild geese to graze upon , or engineer his fields to be a home for the stone curlew .
