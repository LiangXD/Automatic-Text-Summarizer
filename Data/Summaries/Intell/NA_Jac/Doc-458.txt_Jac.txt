Rice attacks the Palestinian leadership, which was democratically elected, as testified by international observers, including former US presidents.No one, no matter who it is, has the right to meddle in the Palestinian domestic affairs or to impose on the Palestinian people a leadership favored by the US Administration and the Israeli Government and tailored according to their mutual interests.The second fact is that if Washington is interested in democratic reforms in order to combat terrorism as it says it is, it should pressure the Israeli leadership to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories and stop its repressive practices against the Palestinian people.The US legislative branch even outbade the Israeli right wing.The flagrant attack, which Condoleezza Rice launched on the Palestinian leadership yesterday, demonstrates how international dictatorship is practiced by the most powerful country on earth, which claims to be democratic and an advocate of nations' right to choose their leaders.Yet, the Palestinian leadership is denounced and attacked while the Israeli prime minister is praised.So, why do Rice and the US Administration launch campaigns against, and interfere in the affairs of, the Palestinian leadership?Both Washington and Israel must realize that the Palestinian people are intelligent enough to read between the lines and understand the long-term aims behind Condoleezza Rice's statements.
