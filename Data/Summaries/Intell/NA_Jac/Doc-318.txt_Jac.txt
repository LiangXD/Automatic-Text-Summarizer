"I have truly never seen anything as beautiful as the Earth from space.Because of his U.S. training, Shuttleworth will have more leeway aboard the space station than Tito did.It will now serve as the space station's lifeboat."The whole continent is proud that, at last, we have one of our own people from Africa up in space," said Mbeki, taking part in celebrations for Freedom Day, marking the 1994 elections that ended Apartheid.Shuttleworth met all the guidelines and went through eight months of cosmonaut training in Russia and one week of instruction at Johnson Space Center in Houston.Shuttleworth, who is among the world's younger space travelers, joined his country's president on Saturday in calling for "a need for Africans to embrace the future and the importance of education, and especially science and mathematics."One orbit, or 1 hours later, South African President Thabo Mbeki called to congratulate the first African citizen in space."It's amazingly roomy," Shuttleworth told the president.Shuttleworth's parents were relieved to see their adventure-seeking son, an entrepreneur who made his fortune off the Internet, safely aboard space station Alpha.NASA opposed Tito's trip, saying he would interfere with space station work and possibly even endanger the crew.The 28-year-old smiled broadly as he floated into the space station and was embraced by its three occupants.
