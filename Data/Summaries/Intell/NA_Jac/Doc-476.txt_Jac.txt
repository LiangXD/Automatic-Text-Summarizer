Thailand and China had preliminary talks on a bilateral free-trade area last year.Local dailies quoted senior Commerce Ministry official Boontipa Simaskul as saying that if China agrees to form a bilateral free-trade area, the time frame will be set immediately.Senior officials from the 10-member ASEAN and China are due to meet in Beijing from May 13 through 15 to draw up a blueprint for a regional free-trade area.Boontipa, head of the ministry's Department of Business Economics, said the time frame of the bilateral free-trade area would be shorter than the 10-year time frame envisaged for a free-trade area between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Thailand is a member.
