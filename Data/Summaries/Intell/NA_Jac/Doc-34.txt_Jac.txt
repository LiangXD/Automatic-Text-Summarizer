Suspended in water , only the GEM for which the antibodies were specific will attach to the beads .There are so many bacteria everywhere that picking out a GEM is a_bit like looking for a candle amongst Blackpool '_ s illumination .This GEM ?are almost certainly the lost GEMs .Once you have the GEMs on the polystyrene spheres they can be washed off and cultured for testing with catechol or other techniques .Engineering a time delayed & bquo ; lethal gene & equo ; into a GEM to give it a finite life ?Their method has been designed for recovering a GEM from water ?This research , to enable identification of a released GEM ?It '_ s not the only way of checking for C230 .could suddenly produce a GEM with some nasty trick up its sleeve .is essential because_of the risks involved in letting GEMs out_of the laboratory .So mt-2 '_ s purified pili and flagellae were injected into animals so that they rapidly produced antibodies specific to them .The researchers have devised a suite of methods based on detecting a marker gene engineered into the GEM .Link: [Comments: zero anaphor of GEMS]There are concerns that , once released , GEMs might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria .The beads plus GEM are recovered with a magnet .A second problem is that many bacteria living & bquo ; in the wild & equo ; are not always easy to culture in the laboratory .But losing GEMs could have much farther reaching implications .by making a GEM both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ?To develop a recovery method , Morgan , Saunders and Pickup used a Gem called Pseudomonas putida mt-2 , a modified common soil bacterium which may have wide applications for destroying toxic substances .of very many different species ?The reluctance of UK Authorities to sanction their release ?But the snag is that first you have to be able to recover the GEMs to culture them to do the catechol yellowing test .GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital .They '_ ve used one that codes for an enzyme called catechol 2,3-dioxygenase ( C230 for short ) .not easy because any bacteria in it are much less abundant than , say in soil .But none of these tricks can insure against a mutation .As a result , it '_ s been estimated that not many more than one per_cent can be cultured at any one time .
