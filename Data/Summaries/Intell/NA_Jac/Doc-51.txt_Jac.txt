Fourteen search teams that were scouring the area Friday were supplemented with additional volunteer teams from across the state Saturday morning, McDonald said.Body of missing ultra marathoner found in New Mexico wilderness Searchers on Saturday found the body of renowned long-distance runner Micah True, who vanished four days earlier after heading out from a lodge for a morning run in the rugged wilderness near New Mexico's Gila National Forest.True, who had been friends with Bruemmer and his wife, Jane, for 10 years, would often visit their lodge while traveling between Mexico and his Boulder, Colo., home.The 58-year-old True, whose extreme-distance running prowess is detailed in the book "Born to Run," set out on what -- for him -- would have been a routine 12-mile run Tuesday from The Wilderness Lodge and Hot Springs, where he was staying.He was featured in articles in running magazines and was a central character -- known by his nickname, "Caballo Blanco" -- in Christopher McDougall's nonfiction best-seller "Born to Run."Michael Sandrock, a columnist who writes about running for The Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, knew True for at least 20 years and had run with him.He said True gave no indication of a specific route, which made the search more difficult.Lodge co-owner Dean Bruemmer, who helped with the search Saturday, said he last saw his friend at breakfast.
