Cabinet officials on Wednesday publicly accused the Buenos Aires governor, Carlos Ruckauf, a former vice president and one of the most powerful leaders of the opposition, of instigating the looting to overthrow the government.Thousands of demonstrators massed and set bonfires in front of the Congress and presidential palace throughout the day, until riot police, including some on horseback, stormed through the crowds this afternoon clubbing people while reinforcements fired water cannon and rubber bullets.In an attempt to save his government, Mr. de la R?4, went on national television on Wednesday night and apologized to the people for their disappointment in his administration's performance.Mr. de la R?decline began in October 2000 with the resignation of his vice president, Carlos Alvarez, over the government's handling of charges that bribes were paid to opposition senators to pass a new labor law.They are also suggesting that business and consumer loans that are now valued in dollars be revalued into new peso amounts that would reduce the overall debt.The president had made a last- ditch effort to form a unity government today with the leading opposition party, but when that was rejected, he announced he would leave.The resignation letter, which was delivered to Congress late in the day, followed violent food riots and protests here and in several cities.Mr. de la R?eclared a state of siege for 30 days on Wednesday, giving him the right to suspend such Constitutional rights as freedom of assembly and speech, and giving him free rein to arrest at will.Mr. de la R?resignation will put the country's immediate future in the hands of the moderate opposition party that controls Congress and had recently begun blocking many of the former president's policies.But Congress can change that, and how it will play its hand will be largely left to opposition leaders, including a former president, Carlos Sa?nem, and Senator Eduardo Duhalde, who lost to Mr. de la R? the 1999 elections.Some aides to Mr. de la R?gued that the federal government should seize Governor Ruckauf's Buenos Aires provincial police force in order to control the rioting that surged in the working-class neighborhoods that surround the capital city.20 - President Fernando de la R?signed today, halfway through his four-year term, swamped by violent protests and looting that erupted when his government failed to reverse a deepening economic crisis.It would take a greater number of devalued pesos to repay their dollar loans.Most opposition party leaders have called for the devaluation of the peso and suspension of payment on the country's debts.He called on the opposition party, known as the Justicialist party, "to participate in a national unity government in which they can bring in their ideas and programs."
