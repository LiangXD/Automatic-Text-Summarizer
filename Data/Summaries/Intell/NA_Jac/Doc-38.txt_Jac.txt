Zoologists have yet to establish the precise mechanisms behind the camel '_ s fuel economy .Underpinning all these accomplishments is the camel '_ s efficient use of metabolic fuel ?Over the same distance , people use two and a half times more energy ( per kilogram of their bulk ) than the average camel .One candidate is the leg musculature , which may turn out to be constructed from slower , more efficient fibres than those employed elsewhere .Analysis of the gas in the balloon told the team how much oxygen the camels were using as they walked .the camel '_ s equivalent of mpg .K. Yousef of the University of Nevada gathered recently in Australia to investigate the camel '_ s fuel economy .Stephen Young on the animals that excel in fuel economy Camels do it better .Once the zoologists had taken account of the difference in weight , the camels emerged as clear winners .The camel '_ s metabolic response to heavy loads is no less dramatic .As the Christmas story demonstrates , more peace-loving potentates also appreciate the camel '_ s skills .Most animals increase their fuel consumption in proportion to the extra baggage they are carrying , but not the camel .a camel burns only around 15 per_cent more fuel than it burns unladen .Camels operate each foreleg and its associated hindleg in unison , more_like a pantomime horse than a regular quadruped .The findings throw fresh light on the camel '_ s former popularity both as pack animal and military mount .Link: [Comments: ]
