Christen said "detainees from the battle field" did not exist as a category under humanitarian law, adding that in an international armed conflict anyone captured on the battlefield was presumed a prisoner of war.The number of detainees being held at the isolated US military outpost on Cuba's southwestern coast rose on Thursday to 110 after the arrival of another 30 prisoners from Afghanistan.ICRC envoys are discussing with US officials whether to release the number of detainees and their nationalities, said Christen.The ICRC considers, however, that they are prisoners of war protected by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949."For us there cannot be special courts.Darcy Christen also said that among the prisoners transferred to the US navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were three British citizens and possibly some French speakers.
