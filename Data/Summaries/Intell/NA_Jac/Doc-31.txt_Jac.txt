Until_now , each parallel computer has been so different that users had to re-write applications every time they changed machines .At a seminar hosted by the Edinburgh Concurrent Supercomputer Project last month , researchers and vendors could finally say with confidence that supercomputing in the 1990s and beyond will be done by parallel computers .The Edinburgh Concurrent Supercomputer Project ( ECSP ) , under Professor David Wallace , now has the largest parallel computer in Europe , with 400 processors which can perform 400 million arithmetical calculations a second .Parallel computing has matured so much that users and manufacturers are beginning to discuss standardisation .There are fundamental limits to how fast a conventional computer can go .how should a parallel computer be programmed ?Faced with these problems , computer scientists began in the mid 1970s to experiment with using many processors in a single machine to work in parallel on a single problem .His group has been involved in parallel computing since the early 1980s ; software produced at CalTech has become a de_facto standard for the various & bquo ; hypercube & equo ; machines manufactured in the United States .The emergence of such standards , and the ability to re-use programs written in conventional languages , should bring down the last barriers to wide acceptance of parallel computing .While some manufacturers advocated the latter , a more popular approach has been to build computers out_of conventional processors so that many current programs and , more importantly , programming concepts , can be recycled .Instead , they can buy more processors and add them to the existing machine .What this power has meant to the scientific and industrial users involved in the ECSP was made apparent during the project '_ s second annual seminar last month .The transputer contains a processor , memory , and communications links on a single chip , which makes it an ideal building block for multi-processor computers .There are practical difficulties with parallel computers .Would it be possible to re-use old programs written for conventional machines , or would users have to start from scratch and throw away their existing investment in software ?Meiko was set up in 1985 by members of the group which developed the transputer chip for Inmos .
