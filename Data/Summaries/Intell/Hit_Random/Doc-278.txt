despite continuing problems in its newsprint business, kimberly-clark corp. posted a 20% gain in third-quarter net income. the consumer-products and newsprint company said net rose to $108.8 million, or $1.35 a share, from $90.5 million, or $1.12 a share, a year ago. after a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings, kimberly-clark attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in north america, brazil and korea. those gains came from higher prices, particularly for disposable diapers and tissue products, and from increased sales, primarily for feminine-care products, the company said. newsprint results continued to be depressed, the company added, because of industrywide price discounting. in the first nine months, profit rose 10% to $313.2 million, or $3.89 a share, from $283.9 million, or $3.53 a share. in new york stock exchange composite trading, kimberly-clark closed at $66.50 a share, up $1.50.
