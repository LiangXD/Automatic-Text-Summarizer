1996-08-20 ronald sandler , chief executive of lloyd's of london , on tuesday underwent a second day of court interrogation about the 300-year-old insurance market's multibillion-dollar recovery plan , which he defended as critical to lloyd's solvency. sandler was questioned for four hours in a federal courtroom by lawyers for american investors in lloyd's and by u.s. district judge robert payne about lloyd's complex restructuring plan to settle large losses. under the rescue proposal , lloyd's was to reinsure billions of dollars in liabilities , including pollution and asbestosis-related claims in the united states , in a new company called equitas. the proposal also includes a 3.2 billion pound ( $4.95 billion ) cash offer to the names designed to offset the cost of equitas. payne questioned sandler for about an hour , asking about lloyd's plans to pay its liabilities and what would happen if its investments made more money than was needed to pay off those liabilities. _ most ( lloyd's officials ) believe that some time over 30 years the liability will be extinguished , _ sandler said , adding that any money left over would go to charities. payne told sandler firmly that the company needed to have a plan for the disposition of leftover assets and that he would need to be told who the benefactors would be. they had claimed that lloyd's knew long_ago the extent of liabilities faced by names. _ we are pleased by this decision.
