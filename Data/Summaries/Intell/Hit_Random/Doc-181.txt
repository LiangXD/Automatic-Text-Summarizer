the computers are biological molecules, using dna for software and enzymes for hardware, and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second. but, say the scientists, tiny dna strands can store huge amounts of information in minuscule space -- one cubic centimeter of dna can store more information than a trillion cds. with the new method, all you need do to get an answer is put all the ingredients into a test tube, mix them together, and check to see what the output is. they work better than anything i've seen so far, said eric baum, a computer scientist at the nec research institute in princeton, new jersey. professor shapiro and a growing number of other scientists believe dna-based computers may lead to a number of useful applications -- they could be planted inside cells, where they would watch for irregularities or even synthesize drugs. natural dna processes also involve inaccuracies which are corrected by other genes, says shapiro, and it is almost impossible to reach absolute accuracy using biological systems. however, for the uses for which the computers are designated, this level of accuracy is adequate.
