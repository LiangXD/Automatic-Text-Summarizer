the white house hastened to describe the bush plan as the most audacious program in american history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions. presented thursday 14 february by president george w. bush, this alternative plan for slowing down global warming moves away from the binding measures of implementation of the kyoto protocol, recently approved by more than 170 countries in marrakech, but rejected in march 2001 by president bush, who deemed it harmful to the us economy and reproached it for imposing constraints on industrialized countries only. mr. bush calls for india and china to act the us president asserted, moreover, his determination to win developing countries over to his plan, stating that the us approach would give them a yardstick for progress on climate changes which recognizes their right to economic development. the white house hastened to describe the bush plan as the most audacious program in american history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions, considering that it would be possible to save the administration up to $1 billion, compared to the costs that binding rules would lead to. carl pope, the director of the sierra club, considers for his part that the bush administration is sticking to the polluting policies that the energy industry asked for rather than taking the sensible steps that can protect our health. according to steve sawyer, one of greenpeace international's climate experts, the plan will have very little effect on emissions, assuming it has any. instead of making itself the champion of the global fight against the greenhouse effect, the united states is moving in exactly the opposite direction from that followed by the rest of the international community with the kyoto protocol, according to greenpeace.
