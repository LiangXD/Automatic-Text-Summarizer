while it was already clear that the economy was well on its way to a recession, the ministry's bureaucrats forecast continued growth for the economy. based on false premises regarding anticipated government revenues and underestimates of the need for defense expenditures, a totally unrealistic budget was prepared. it was only when the government's income from taxes started to fall far short of the forecast that the bureaucrats woke up. in an attempt to keep the coalition afloat, money was again parceled out right and left, and the government's budget deficit increased beyond reasonable bounds. the bloated budget was passed through the knesset to the sounds of ministerial congratulations advertising a great political triumph. at the same time, there was no let-up in his continuing battle with the governor of the bank of israel, who is supposed to be his partner in managing israel's economy. but successful management of the economy - the second front - is essential so that the resources needed for defense needs can be made available without causing serious damage to the economy. @ copyright 2002 ha'aretz.
