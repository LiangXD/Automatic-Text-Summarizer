you're last gift of $50.00 helped make it possible for us to provide guidance, encouragement and fun to nearly 400 indianapolis area children. what has your support of our campers meant to them and what have they been able to accomplish because you care? in just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids and a few extra activities to a team of almost 60 young adults taking on real projects. yl teens will make j.c. juniors happen again this year for 7 and 8 year old campers. that means we now have the opportunity to be a stable, positive and important part of each child's life for an entire decade. if you can increase your last donation, we would appreciate that show of support for the campers and their efforts to overcome obstacles and create successful lives. sincerely, julie marsh, executive director p.s. you make it possible for us to help special kids with learning disabilities, behavior problems and economic disadvantages to gain the confidence required to put genuine effort into achieving real goals.
