on behalf of some palestinian survivors, lawyers luc walleyn and michael verhaeghe on 18 june filed a complaint with the brussels public prosecution office against sharon and other israeli and lebanese persons deemed responsible for the massacres in beirut. it published a report, but not all the documents and interrogation reports were released, because they were deemed damaging to the state's interests. walleyn are verhaeghe are convinced of the authenticity of the documents. the lawyers expect that the public prosecution office will request israel to confirm the documents' authenticity. it had already been known that lebanese phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with israel, but according to the lawyers, various documents now indicate that israel and the phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance, that israel exercised complete control over the militias, and that, in the wake of the massacres, the israeli army instructed the phalange to assume responsibility. in the meantime, the lawyers have also initiated a civil suit against elie hobeika, the militia leader who is regarded as one of the main perpetrators of the massacres. the lawyers deemed it wise to do this now because one of collignon's questions is connected with the juridical consequences of a lebanese amnesty law.
