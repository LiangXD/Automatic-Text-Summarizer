jammu, apr 2 -- chief minister dr. farooq abdullah today accused pakistan army for breeding terrorism in india to remain in power against the wishes of their people who want peace. 'for their sustenance and survival, pak generals have been throttling the voice of pakistanis who wish to live in friendship and cordiality with their neighbours', the chief minister said while addressing a function organised by united public high school at channi himat here this afternoon. the chief minister described pakistan as mother of terrorism and said if the world has to rid itself from this menace, the perpetrators across the border had to be dealt with firmly. he said mere positioning of army at borders was not enough as infiltration was still continuing. the ultras were indulging in blood-shed and their lunaticism has touched such heights that they were not even sparing the worship places, he said and referred to the attack in raghunath bazaar and temple complex. reiterating that pakistan will not give up terror, the chief minister said that ultimately the demon they have reared will eat up their own vitals. he said pakistan is attempting hard to put india in communal flames so that forces are withdrawn from the borders to deal with the internal situations, thereby leaving field day for ultras to cross over to this side.
