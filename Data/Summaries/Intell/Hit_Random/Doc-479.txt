for some time, european politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with israel -- a move, which in light of close and extensive trade relations between eu member states and israel, could cause serious damage. earlier this week, belgian foreign minister louis michel, who does not miss an opportunity to provoke israel, threatened that the eu would once again reconsider its relations with jerusalem. european commission president romano prodi expressed similar sentiments: in his opinion, the eu should consider imposing an economic punishment on israel in protest against the operations of the israel defense forces in the territories. the same goes for spanish foreign minister josep pique, who was offended after israel refused to allow him and eu foreign policy chief javier solana to meet with pa chairman yasser arafat in ramallah. it takes more than a recommendation from the european parliament for this to happen the decision has to be taken by both the european commission and the eu's council of foreign ministers, on which all 15 foreign ministers sit, and has to be unanimous. israel will not change its positions on vital security issues, even if the european states eliminate customs breaks afforded to israeli exports. what holds true with regard to threats by eu leaders also holds true for threats expressed by certain european states and the means of punishment they might already be implementing.
