this carnage is planned and implemented in compliance with decisions from israeli field marshals. people are being killed in masses and buried in collective graves. the israeli government is committing crimes of war against the palestinians and should be tried by an international tribunal just like the governments of rwanda and former yugoslavia. an international tribunal for war crimes has been established in rome and started its works officially last thursday with the approval of more than 60 countries. the palestinian people and the entire arab world are waiting for a proof that international law protects human beings in general regardless of their color, ethnicity and religion. we are waiting to see that international laws are not selective and that they are not applied for political, cultural and ideological considerations. the public opinion in the arab and islamic world is following closely what is happening in the occupied palestinian territories.
