however you want to categorize these creeps - who are living a lot better at club fed than they ever did in the caves of tora bora - geneva convention rules are for uniformed soldiers, not for skyjackers who fly commercial planes filled with moms and dads into office buildings manned by civilians operating computers, or for zealots who kill arab women because they drive a car or don't cover their faces. al-qaeda is a terrorist organization, not a state, and its crazies wear street gear and operate disguised as civilians. i'm personally offended that none of the whistle-blowers seems to give a damn about the welfare or safety of our sons and daughters guarding these thugs. they're not pleased that the brass, the lawmakers and the press are more interested in the well-being of the detainees than the soldiers guarding them, and that they might as well be invisible. here's what our soldiers from the army's 401st mp company out of fort hood, texas, who are the main monster-watchers, are saying: we live like crap down here with no extra pay or tax break, and we feel that no one up above gives a rat's ass about us, a sergeant says. the marine general here says we can have a beer when off duty, but our army leadership is running so scared that it set a no-drinking policy, says another troop. maybe someday, do-gooders, editors, lawmakers and senior army leaders will remember our soldiers are human beings with human rights, too, and get their side of the story.
