the oat-bran craze has cost the world's largest cereal maker market share. kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival general mills inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. analysts say much of kellogg's erosion has been in such core brands as corn flakes, rice krispies and frosted flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume. cheerios and honey nut cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats, says merrill lynch food analyst william maguire. the company has five other u.s. plants, including a modern facility at its battle creek headquarters known as building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year. initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged from $1 billion to $1.2 billion. fluor daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew, the sources said.
