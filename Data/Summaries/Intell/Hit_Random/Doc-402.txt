mugabe victory leaves west in tatters harare: western countries were left frustrated and impotent after robert mugabe formally declared that he had overwhelmingly won zimbabwe's presidential election. the zimbabwe registrar-general, tobaiwa mudede, declared that mugabe had won a fifth term in office after the results from all 120 constituencies were returned. he said mugabe had won 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,401 for challenger morgan tsvangirai, leader of the movement for democratic change (mdc). in the harare townships where people stood in line for two days to vote in the belief that they were consigning mugabe to history, angry residents looked to tsvangirai to confront the government. the government, sensing murmurs about revolt, put the army on full alert, deployed troops in key townships and the police set up roadblocks on the main roads into harare to stop and search vehicles for weapons. in zimbabwe the leadership of the congress of trade unions is considering calling a two-day general strike to test whether there would be popular support for a longer protest, and various civil rights groups are meeting today to discuss mass civil disobedience. in the final results, mugabe made a net gain of votes compared with the 2000 parliamentary election in every province in the country.
