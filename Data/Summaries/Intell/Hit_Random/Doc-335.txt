the space shot might be rescheduled for this evening, but a decision won't be made until this morning, a nasa official said thursday. on wednesday, an unmanned russian supply rocket filled with food, clothes, toilet supplies and other items arrived at the station but had trouble docking. sensors and photos showed that debris about the width of a piece of string or wire is preventing a solid fit on the docking, said jim van laak, nasa manager of operations and integration for the space station. but nasa officials want further study because they are concerned it might damage the locking mechanism for the supply ship. "what we are concerned about is a wobbl ing" that could damage the locking mechanism, van laak said. a bigger question is when to send russian cosmonauts outside the station to fix the problem without messing up the space crew's tight work timeline. there won't be a final answer until this morning, van laak said.
