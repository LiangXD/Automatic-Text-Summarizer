the boj also needs to encourage the financial institutions to reduce their reliance on overnight money prior_to its introduction of the _ real-time gross settlement _ ( rtgs ) system , they said. for_example , analysts said , a sudden rise to 0.58 percent in the key overnight call rate on march 24 , when many banks suffered from paying more than they expected , was seen as planned. the rate was at 0.53 percent on the previous day. _ by allowing the key overnight rate to rise sharply , the boj at that time let market participants know that they should take a liquidity risk as long as they rely on the overnight money , _ said shoji kitta , president of totan research co. _ also , if the boj leaves the current upward bias in the key overnight rate after april , which is highly likely , that may encourage banks to use longer-term transactions and lessen settlement risks in trading overnight money , _ he said. overnight money totalled 25.5 trillion yen at the end of january , which accounted more than 60 percent of the outstanding amounts in the call interbank money market. the central bank has since december gathered ideas from the financial institutions based in tokyo on the rtgs system , in which transactions are settled instantly on a real-time basis through the accounts that they have at the boj. the boj has said the financial firms' efforts to reduce reliance on overnight call money and do more longer-term transactions is necessary for an introduction of the rtgs. but once any defaults , all transactions would need to be halted , paralysing the entire system. _ once banks do have concerns about liquidity risk , they should raise more longer-term funds.
