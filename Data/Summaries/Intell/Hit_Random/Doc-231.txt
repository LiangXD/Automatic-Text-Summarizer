seven months after having rejected the kyoto protocol because he considered it to be without scientific basis, detrimental to us economic interests, and unfair in not obliging medium-sized nations (like brazil and india) to reduce their gas emissions in the same proportion as that imposed on industrialized countries, bush made public the plan that, he promised, would not have any of the defects of the kyoto protocol and would achieve the same, if not better, results. but what the us government does not emphasize is that the natural tendency of the economy is for services to increase their participation in the gdp, and for industrial activities, which are the biggest energy consumers, to diminish. the break with kyoto had been a pre-attack marker in the bush administration, for having demonstrated the latter's absolute indifference to the opinion of even its closest allies, such as germany, france, the united kingdom, and japan. after the world trade center and pentagon tragedies, there were some who thought that washington's rapprochement with its traditional partners was inevitable, with the goal of defeating the threat of international terrorism. after the world trade center and pentagon tragedies, there were some who thought that washington's rapprochement with its traditional partners was inevitable, with the goal of defeating the threat of international terrorism. however, after a brief period of shock, bush resumed his solitary road, as he clearly demonstrated in his state of the union speech, in which he threatened the axis of evil countries (iran, iraq, and north korea) without consulting the europeans and japanese, who do not necessarily agree with the appropriateness of antagonizing the governments of those nations. the announcement of a plan that is supposedly an alternative to the kyoto protocol, but which in practice rejects it in a way that cannot be taken seriously by the countries who committed themselves to it (among which is brazil), only deserves rejection in response and to provoke in retrospect an enormous concern about what the only world superpower intends in future.
