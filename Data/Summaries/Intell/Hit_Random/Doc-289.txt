us begins flying afghan prisoners to cuba washington: the us military on thursday began flying al-qaeda and taliban prisoners under heavy guard from afghanistan to jail at the american navy base in guantanamo bay, cuba, a military spokesman said. the human rights advocacy group amnesty international expressed concern about reports that the prisoners may be drugged, hooded and shackled, saying that they must be treated with full respect for international standards. if restraints are necessary, they must be applied humanely, with adequate opportunity for the prisoner to move limbs, use the bathroom and eat and drink, the group said in a statement. they are fully aware that these are dangerous individuals, he said during a press conference with australian defence minister robert hill. what we have done all along is (said) that they are being treated humanely in accordance with the geneva convention, clarke told reporters. the defence department has not announced any decision on how many of the detainees will be transferred or how many, if any, might face military courts martial authorized by president george w bush in the wake of the september attacks. under close scrutiny from civil rights groups, rumsfeld has been studying how such trials could be held while protecting the rights of any defendants and keeping tight security over the us war on terrorism declared by bush after the attacks.
