he could grow hedges and wildflowers instead_of sugar beet he could turn his fields into areas of & bquo quiet countryside enjoyment & equo he could restore ancient coppices and chalk grassland. or he could sell most of his land to mr big and his house and a_few acres could fall into the hands of a merchant banker who wants somewhere quiet with a paddock for the daughter '_ s ponies. there is a big fear in the hills that in_order_to maintain businesses in the lowlands , people will diversify into sheep , and the profitability of sheep in the lowlands will be greater. & equo in fact , the countryside commission has just announced an imaginative scheme for 12 & bquo community forests & equo on marginal urban fringe farmland. but the community forests ? plus the commission '_ s other plan for 100,000 acres of new forest in the midlands , which will also soak up redundant land ? together with new land released for development , will barely scratch the surface of the problem. there are also emotional objections. & bquo we wish to see as many farmers as possible occupying the countryside , & equo said melinda appleby. & bquo we want to see a working countryside and we do n't want to see it fossilised so it '_ s almost like a theme park. & equo farmers have higher hopes of the & bquo extensification & equo programme in the wings. it would also depend on incentives and on some serious stimulus from the conservation lobby. & bquo people were extremely disappointed that conservationists could not come up with exciting positive solutions for potential land that might come out_of agriculture , & equo says miss appleby. she goes on : & bquo the problem with taking a management decision out_of a farmer '_ s hands as an economic decision and putting it into conservationists hands is that the conservationists do n't always agree. & bquo in the future , it seems , we are going to be taking arbitrary decisions about what we want from the countryside : the large blue here , a certain bird there , and we are going to manage for those species , which will mean that everything_else will go. & equo the countryside may be changing.
