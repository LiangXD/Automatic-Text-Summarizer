on thursday [29 november] the belgian government formally committed itself, vis-a-vis its russian and european partners (the european space agency [esa]), to pay frank de winne's ticket into space. the formal agreement regarding frank de winne's flight with the russians was signed in brussels on thursday by charles picque, the minister for science policy, and his government commissioner yvan ylieff. in brussels on wednesday [28 november], the french astronaut claudie haignere, who had just completed a flight in space together with the russians that in every way was identical to the one scheduled for de winne, could not find enough praise for our fellow citizen, with whom she trained for several months in moscow. he is making appreciable efforts to meet the other foreign cosmonauts who are in training there and share his experiences. the sum in question will come from the sstc's space budgets and be deducted in several years (two or three). the sums obtained will result from the assignment of a portion of the space budget to this mission (and its many related scientific fall-outs) rather than to other optional programs. since there is no other belgian astronaut at the esa who is capable of replacing frank de winne for this mission if it suddenly proved impossible for him to carry it out, we are also expecting to take out 'travel insurance' for our 'cosmonaut,' yvan ylieff also said.
