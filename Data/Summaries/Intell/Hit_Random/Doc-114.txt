the tragic and shocking events that shook the united states, destroying a number of its economic, urban, and military landmarks, have aroused grief and sorrow worldwide. this is because the terrorist violence has struck innocent women and children and defenseless civilians. nobody who has a live conscience and human feelings, whether he is palestinian or otherwise, could not have been moved by these events and expressed sympathy for the families of the us victims, regardless of the us political stances that are totally biased to israel and israel's use of the most advanced us weapons to curb the palestinian intifadah. these people saw the majority of their security sites destroyed and the residential neighborhoods and apartment buildings parallel to the combat lines with the israeli army and settlements in the west bank and gaza targeted by the apaches helicopters and large-caliber artillery and machine guns. such a comparison would be theoretically valid if israel withdrew from the occupied territories but the violence of terrorism against it continued. while the world is busy following the news of the attacks on the us targets and feeling sorry for these acts, israel carried out an incursion into janin and the neighboring villages, bombarded more palestinian internal security sites, demolished more homes in east jerusalem, and killed an additional number of palestinian activists and non-activists, including an 11-year-old girl. it is very important for the united states to realize the difference between the us and israeli cases.
