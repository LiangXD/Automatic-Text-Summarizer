this architecture was adopted because it was simple to build , fitted the theoretical preconceptions of early computer scientists , and seemed to offer the greatest reliability. at a seminar hosted by the edinburgh concurrent supercomputer project last month , researchers and vendors could finally say with confidence that supercomputing in the 1990s and beyond will be done by parallel computers. for one thing , builders had to solve the problems of making processors communicate with one_another quickly and reliably. would it be possible to re-use old programs written for conventional machines , or would users have to start from scratch and throw away their existing investment in software ? while some manufacturers advocated the latter , a more popular approach has been to build computers out_of conventional processors so that many current programs and , more importantly , programming concepts , can be recycled. the transputer contains a processor , memory , and communications links on a single chip , which makes it an ideal building block for multi-processor computers. his group has been involved in parallel computing since the early 1980s software produced at caltech has become a de_facto standard for the various & bquo hypercube & equo machines manufactured in the united states.
