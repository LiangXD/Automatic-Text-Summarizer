august 4, 1999 name address city, st zip the goal of mccoy, inc. has been to make a difference. in 1998, mccoy, inc. led two efforts that, we believe, will help our community continue to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop well. participants in the youth outcomes educational initiative identified three goals for all our youth to obtain: economic self-sufficiency, healthy family, social relationships, and involvement in the community. a short time later, the community youth mapping project sent 55 young people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow up well: caring adults, safe places to go, and positive things to do. one group of adults and one group of youth, through two very different processes, have arrived at the same conclusion our community still has much to do if we are to help all of your youth successfully develop into the responsible, productive adults who will our community in the future. as it has been an exciting year for all of us, mccoy, inc. cannot do its part without the support of organizations like yours. annually, we ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort to help young people grow up well in indianapolis.
