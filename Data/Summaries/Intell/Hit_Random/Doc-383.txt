mugabe won polls unfairly says west president rob-ert mugabe swept back to power in zimbabwe yesterday after an election fiercely condemned by local monitors, the opposition and the west but praised by african nations. opposition leader morgan tsvangirai, easily beaten by the veteran president according to official results, said mugabe had stolen the vote through violence and intimidation and by preventing hundreds of thousands of people from voting. two state department officials said washington aimed to impose financial restrictions against any assets in the us held by mugabe and senior members of his government but could not say when they would take effect. a deep split appeared between western nations and african countries monitoring the vote, who closed ranks behind mugabe, calling the election legitimate. south africa and nigeria together with australia comprise a special commonwealth group given the power to take measures against zimbabwe if the election is deemed not to have been free and fair. information minister jonathan moyo said the result was a blow to british prime minister tony blair whom mugabe accuses of sponsoring tsvangirai. the former colonial power britain said that mugabe had held on to power through a systematic campaign of violence and intimidation.
