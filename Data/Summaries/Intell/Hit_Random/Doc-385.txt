18 the fall and rise of hugo chavez in venezuela, the dust is finally settling after the dramatic turbulence of the past two weeks. we are happy to collectively have overcome the era of coup d'etats in the region, and when events in venezuela took on the appearance of a military coup there was a reaction by everyone, said brazil's president fernando henrique cardoso. the venezuelan leader has struck friendships with cuban, libyan and iraqi leaders with great fanfare, and his open defiance of u.s. interests has wooed venezuelans wary of u.s. power. indeed, after all the muscle-flexing, mr. chavez has little to offer the venezuelan people. he has also alienated workers at his country's state-owned oil company, petroleos de venezuela, by replacing long-serving professionals with his supporters. interestingly, mr. chavez initially rose to power in the 1990s because of the discontent with former president carlos andres perez, who had ordered the military to shoot at crowds in 1989. and, while only time will tell if he would voluntarily give up power when his term in 2006, one thing is certain: a serious investigation of the massacre of april 2002 is certainly called for.
