still, mr. bush's reaction to the biggest international economic crisis so far in his presidency is a telling example of a new - and perhaps risky - approach to the kind of national economic bankruptcies that dominated washington's dealings with the world's emerging markets in the late 1990's. it's fair to say, one senior administration official noted during the last week, that while we have been clear, we haven't always been consistent. the hard line on argentina, white house and treasury officials say, was calculated to send the message that under the bush administration, the united states would be a reluctant financial firefighter and that the markets should not bet on a bailout. it is a message that mr. bush's aides said in interviews this week that they hoped would force officials of developing countries and foreign investors to work out their problems without relying as much on huge aid packages from the international monetary fund and from washington, which became commonplace after mexico. treasury officials in the clinton era never shied away from dispensing a steady stream of advice to countries on the condition that they would have to meet to get western aid. officials say mr. o'neill supported the decision by the i.m.f. to cut off argentina's loans because it had failed to meet the fund's demands for fiscal restraint. president bush never talked about specific steps he expected the argentine government to take, said one white house official familiar with mr. bush's periodic calls and letters to mr. de la r?d the series of his successors in recent weeks.
