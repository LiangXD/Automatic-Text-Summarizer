he says his letter in answer to the antiglobalists' arguments is personal, but prime minister guy verhofstadt is taking good care that his partners opinions' are being heard, that general considerations alternate with real initiatives, that concessions are sufficiently concrete, and that his letter that will be published this monday [10 september] will attract worldwide attention. during this meeting, she has scheduled a meeting with peaceful antiglobalists, but there is little i can do, she said in an interview. this is no blind violence but rather targeted violence, annemie neyts said referring to the antiglobalist movement that set gothenburg and genoa, among other cities, ablaze. they thought they had lost the game, and all at once they see an opportunity to resume their ideological fight against capitalism. trade alone will not save the world, neyts said, but in as far as it refers to the free exchange of products and movement of persons, it constitutes an important factor for economic development. certain excesses at eu meetings and, above all, at 'summits,' the so-called 'high masses,' sometimes call for a reaction. closing off a zone by means of containers, as was done in genoa, is an act of objectionable brutality.
