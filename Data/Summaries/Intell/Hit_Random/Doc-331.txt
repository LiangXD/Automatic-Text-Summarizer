africa, west split over mugabe's win subhead: chretien to await observers' report before acting author: jan cienski with files from jane taber in ottawa harare, zimbabwe - as robert mugabe moved to consolidate his victory in elections most observers denounced as rigged, an ugly split was opening up in the response from black african nations and the west. the win gives the 78-year-old mr. mugabe a six-year term in office and was hailed by patrick chinamasa, zimbabwe's justice minister, as a runaway victory. we do not recognize the outcome of the election because we think it's flawed, mr. bush said. mr. chretien, who this month headed off a move to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth in advance of the vote, said the election of mr. mugabe does not look very good but insisted canada must wait for the results of a commonwealth report before acting. john reynolds, the canadian alliance leader, said zimbabwe should be suspended from the commonwealth and its high commissioner to canada sent packing until we straighten this mess out. thousands of voters in harare were chased away from polling stations on monday night by police, despite waiting for three chaotic days to cast their ballots. in many cases neither the mdc nor neutral observers were able to monitor voting in more remote polling stations.
