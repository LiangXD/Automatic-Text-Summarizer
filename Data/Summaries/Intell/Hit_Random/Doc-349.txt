the next mission for nasa could be to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program. in doing so, the white house is swapping the silver-visored helmet of a space cadet for the green eyeshade of a consummate bean counter. where mr. goldin was a product of the us aerospace industry, mr. o'keefe has served as chief financial officer for the pentagon, navy secretary, and business-school professor. the project's costs, like those of the space-shuttle program before it, have ballooned far beyond original estimates - from an initial $17.4 billion to more than $30 billion. and this month, a task force on the project's budget concluded that nasa's cost estimate for finishing the core station between 2002 and 2008 is not credible. in assessing how the agency might fare under o'keefe, some analysts say it could blossom, as it did in its apollo-program heyday under another numbers guy, james webb. o'keefe's appointment is a clear message from the administration: nasa has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we'd like to see nasa do, says patricia dasch of the national space society.
