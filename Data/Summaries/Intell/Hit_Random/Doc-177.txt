bagram, afghanistan, dec 7 (afp) - in a foretaste of resistance to foreign peacekeepers by the northern alliance, an uneasy atmosphere reigns between us forces and their afghan allies at the bagram airbase north of kabul. once the main soviet airbase during moscow's 1979-89 invasion of afghanistan, bagram has now become the hub for flights into the country as kabul's own airport cannot be used because of unexploded us bombs. although northern alliance control the main entrance to the base, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of kabul, just inside the perimeter there is a checkpoint manned by heavily-armed us soldiers. he said that northern alliance commanders were irritated by images of armed us soldiers on afghan soil, and so media access to the base had to be temporarily suspended. ironically, some 200 armed russians, who appeared to be from the military although they were dressed in uniforms of russia's emergencies ministry, set up camp 10 days ago in the centre of kabul. under the power-sharing accord signed in bonn on wednesday, which should see a new interim government take power on december 22, a mainly muslim un-mandated security force is to be deployed in kabul. however northern alliance defence minister general mohammad qasim fahim said the same day that he had rebuffed a british offer to send troops to kabul in the coming days and insisted he wants a strictly limited un force.
