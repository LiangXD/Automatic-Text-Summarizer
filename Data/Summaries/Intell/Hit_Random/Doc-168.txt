he indicated that there is a long way to go and a great deal of effort to put in before global warming can be successfully arrested. this excessive emission of greenhouse gases has caused the mean global temperature to rise by 0.4 to 0.8 degree c in the past 140 years. if emission of greenhouse gases is not rigorously limited and is allowed to continue to climb, then the average global temperature may surge by 1.5 to 5.8 c. the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by most developing nations in the past several decades only represents a small fraction of the total emission. this increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by industrialized nations. it has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions by efficiency improvement, energy conservation, and development of advanced energy technology. during this conference, countries such as japan, russia, australia, and canada played the same tactic again to try to delay the implementation of the kyoto protocol.
