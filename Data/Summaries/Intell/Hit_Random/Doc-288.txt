mugabe confident of victory in historic zimbabwe vote harare-zimbabwean president robert mugabe predicted victory saturday as he cast his ballots in presidential and local elections at a primary school in harare's working-class suburb of highfield. asked if he would accept the results of the hotly contested election, mugabe said: i will accept it, more than accept it because i will have won. the 78-year-old former guerrilla leader, who has governed since independence in 1980, took another swipe at the former colonial power britain and other western nations, which he said have prejudged the vote. mugabe was clearly expected to turn up at mhofu school in highfield, where state television had a truck posted and had been broadcasting live since polls opened early saturday. several of mugabe's ministers and senior aides were also on hand to see their leader cast his ballot, as well as a throng of reporters and camera operators. mugabe had to vote at that particular ward in order to be able to cast ballots both for president and for mayor in harare, which is holding the two elections simultaneously. the opposition movement for democratic change (mdc) complained that the set-up was deliberately confusing in a ploy to discourage the urban vote, which is thought to favor mugabe's challenger morgan tsvangirai. -afp @ pakistan observer 1998-2001
