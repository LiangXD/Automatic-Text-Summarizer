but how could blair have a commonwealth report when no one else had received such a report that should be channeled through the secretariat to all members, asked one of the other 53 commonwealth leaders at the retreat? the british leader fudged his reply and the commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the blair report had already been written in london before the commonwealth mission even left for zimbabwe. the commonwealth leaders, many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between zimbabwe and its former coloniser, britain, breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process. furthermore, as anyone who has been following the zimbabwean press can testify, many of the meikles farms around the country have been acquired by the state as part of the land reform programme. the final straw that confirmed that australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the australian prime minister, john howard, ordered his high commissioner in harare not to attend sunday's inauguration of robert mugabe as president of zimbabwe. the australians, in common with other white members of the commonwealth, the european union (eu), the americans, norwegians and the swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore mugabe as the head of state. howard, however, will not be isolated at the three-member meeting at marlborough house in london.
