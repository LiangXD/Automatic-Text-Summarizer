march appears to be a more reasonable estimate while earlier admission cannot be entirely ruled out, according to chen, also taiwan's chief wto negotiator. we will also phase out internal protection of such products and remove export subsidies. at the same time, the average tariff rate on 3,470 industrial items would be slashed to 4.2 percent eventually from the current 6.0 percent, he added. chen said taiwan's external trade has less of a need to readjust itself in the post-wto era as it has long functioned under a market-oriented economy and already largely conforms to international conventions. taiwan-made products stood a good chance of becoming even more competitive thanks to wider access to overseas markets and lower costs for material imports, he said. however an expected increase in farm imports would certainly have an impact on the domestic agricultural sector, he said. the vice minister said taiwan's service industry was unlikely to sustain an excessive impact as it has been largely opened to private and foreign participation.
