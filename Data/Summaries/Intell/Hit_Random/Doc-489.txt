mbeki, obasanjo envoys in fresh bid to save mugabe staff reporter 3/28/02 1:22:20 am (gmt +2) african superpowers south africa and nigeria this week stepped up efforts to broker a comprise between zimbabwe's ruling zanu pf party and the opposition movement for democratic change (mdc) to ward off the crisis of illegitimacy facing controversially elected president robert mugabe's new administration. mbeki and obasanjo have given the duo three weeks to come up with a solution that will help bridge the rift between the two political parties and arrest the deteriorating political and economic crisis in the country. diplomatic sources say african leaders are frantically making efforts to bring the mdc on board through the formation of a coalition government in order to facilitate recognition of the zimbabwean government by the international community and unlock much-needed foreign aid that has been suspended. the mdc has said it wants fresh elections conducted under international supervision by the united nations within the shortest possible period. zanu pf however wants the mdc to accept the result of the presidential election and join it in a coalition government whose composition is not yet clear. the sources said the formation of a coalition government being pushed by mbeki and obasanjo was the most ideal way to stave off international isolation of zimbabwe but has been received with mixed feelings by the governing party. the 54-nation commonwealth, the 15-nation european union and most of the former eastern bloc states, the united states, the scandinavian countries and most western states and japan have refused to recognise mugabe's re-election saying it was a blatant fraud and marred by state-sponsored violence.
