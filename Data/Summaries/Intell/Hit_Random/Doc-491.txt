the summit's declaration was the best piece of news the middle east has produced since the oslo accords between prime minister yitzhaq rabin and palestinian leader yasir arafat were signed on the lawn in front of the white house in washington in 1993. as a first step israeli forces were sent into the main palestinian town, ramallah, where arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous palestinian areas are administered. now he declared that arafat was an enemy. israeli's antiterrorist operations must not bring the palestinian authority to collapse, israeli forces must not reconquer the territories under the jurisdiction of the authority, and arafat the man must not be molested. according to these sources, sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while arafat hesitated. he demonstrated this he as defense minister during the 1982 invasion of lebanon, which led to arafat's being forced into exile in tunis. terrorism thrives in an atmosphere of hate, and the israeli occupation and the use of military force are creating the fertile soil from which future terrorists will be recruited.
