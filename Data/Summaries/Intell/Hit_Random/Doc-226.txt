the annual report published by the national bureau for defending land and resisting colonization in cooperation with the international solidarity establishment for human rights said that the nuclei of 36 new settlements were established from march 2001 to the end of november 2001 in various parts of the west bank. he stressed the need to concentrate on resisting settlement activity, settlers and their militias, and abstaining from subjecting this file to any discussion as a condition for halting the intensified settlement activities and removing existing settlements. he noted that the year since sharon became israel prime minister and his pursuit of a destructive, aggressive policy against the palestinian people has proved that the conflict with the palestinian people who cling to their national rights cannot be settled by force. he said: there are two grave violations, the first concerns settlement building and the transfer of settlers to the palestinian territories on which tens of settlements have been built. he surveyed the attacks against unarmed citizens carried out by settlers, the legal protection and backing they are provided by israeli governments, and the encouragement that this gives them to continue their assaults. he indicated that settlements have emerged as military bastions and bases for launching attacks against palestinians during the intifadah. he noted that during the current intifadah settlers uprooted more than 6,580 fruit trees, destroyed more than 4,099 cultivated donums, while 85 houses, 90 commercial premises, more than 100 cars, and 17 ambulances were damaged as a result of attacks carried out by settlers.
