barney spender london 1997-03-31 christian vieri had the honour of celebrating his international debut on saturday by scoring italy's 1,000th goal but another against poland in chorzow on wednesday could have the greater long-term significance. having already beaten england at wembley , a win for cesare maldini's men would effectively secure their place at next year's world cup finals in france. three well-taken goals and three valuable points but still room for improvement against a polish team which also came close to upsetting england at wembley and who give nothing away on their home turf. _ poland will be a difficult side to play against but if we go there and play with the same attitude that we showed tonight , then things should go well , _ said stefano eranio after the moldova match. maldini is likely to stick as closely as possible to saturday's side although lazio defender alessandro nesta and parma striker enrico chiesa are out. the entire bosnian team is dangerous and they will certainly play better from the first match in greece. the bosnians , meanwhile , are bubbling with confidence about the prospect of playing in front of 40,000 at the kosevo olympic stadium. _ i think i_ 'll get a goal and we_ 'll win the match , _ said captain meho kodro. after a comfortable 4-0 win over san marino , the netherlands face a sterner test against turkey in ankara as they look to make it five out_of five in group seven.
