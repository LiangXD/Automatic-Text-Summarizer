bush takes great leap forward in pledging u.s. help in defending taiwan in a closed-door meeting in florida last week, the bush administration took a great leap forward in its declared policy that taiwan remain separate from china so long as the people of taiwan wish, even if that requires u.s. military force. why the meeting was so hidden was not clear, other than to avoid flaunting it in the face of china, which claims sovereignty over taiwan and protests every american action favoring the island. even so, enough leaked out to illuminate president bush's policy, which has been consistent ever since he enunciated it during his campaign for the presidency. after talking with wolfowitz for two hours, tang said he had guaranteed that his government would by no means take any provocative step toward china. the meeting, at an exclusive resort in st. petersburg, brought out representatives of america's biggest defense contractors -- lockheed martin, boeing, northrop grumman, raytheon, general dynamics, united technologies, textron, honeywell international, and united defense. bush began enunciating his policy on taiwan in november 1999, saying that he would honor our promises to the people of taiwan and we deny the right of beijing to impose their rule on a free people. bush has repeatedly referred to the tra in a not-so-subtle message to china that the law is the bedrock of his posture on taiwan.
