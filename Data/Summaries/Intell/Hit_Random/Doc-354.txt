and now coup-plotting military officers and the reinstalled president, hugo chavez, need to show latin america that their tyrannical tactics are at an end. president chavez - a former army coup-meister himself, who was elected three years ago - has abused his popular mandate with heavy-handed measures based on a constitution largely rewritten by himself and his supporters. and his economic promises to the poor are in shreds, while his diplomatic flirtation with leftist world dictators only hints at his inclinations to gain more power. but latin america has moved beyond coups, and this pivotal nation in a hemisphere of democracies has the means to remove mr. chavez by constitutional and especially nonviolent means. that was a catalyst for pent-up opposition to chavez. when gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace last thursday, killing more than a dozen, military leaders forced chavez to step aside. but then international pressure and renewed domestic support for chavez forced the generals to let him take office again.
