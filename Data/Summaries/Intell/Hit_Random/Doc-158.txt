it is not enough to proclaim, even in the constitution, that one peso is worth one dollar, for that to be really the case. the linking to the dollar, as a guarantee of stability, was meant to rid them of the hyperinflation running at 2000 percent a year they had experienced during the 1970s and 80s. also on the part of the international monetary fund whose principal role is to be watchdog before bailing out those who come unstuck. credibility evaporated, to quote the expression of one expert who stresses the paradoxes of a system whose bases seemed sound. second paradox: the self-proclaimed parity between the peso and the dollar never enabled the government and even less private borrowers to obtain credit terms to match those enjoyed by the americans. this is why dollarization has generated such support among politicians: from former president carlos menem, today leader of the most influential peronist faction, to new finance secretary miguel kiguel, a former banker, charged along with domingo cavallo with restoring order to public finances. the final switch to the dollar would stabilize relations between creditors and debtors.
