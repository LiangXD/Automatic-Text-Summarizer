plunged into chaos by looting and deadly riots that forced fernando de la rua to resign as president a week ago, argentina fell deeper into anarchy when interim leader adolfo rodriguez saa quit on sunday after losing his party's support. argentina's biggest political force, the peronists, who ruled from 1989-99, withdrew support from rodriguez saa, accusing him of being power-hungry, and convinced other parties to accept in his stead peronist heavyweight senator eduardo duhalde. governor carlos ruckauf of the vast buenos aires province said all parties had to help the peronists in a national salvation government... with consensus that the person in charge until 2003 should be duhalde. de la rua's cowed radical party agreed, with senior party official federico storani saying it would be madness to hold elections now because the interim government wouldn't have the power to apply measures to get us over this crisis. landed with the provisional presidency for 48 hours, the head of the lower house of congress, eduardo camano, called on senators and deputies to hold a legislative assembly today which should rubber-stamp duhalde's appointment. the country of 36 million people is living in fear of more shop looting and violence that killed 27 people before de la rua quit, of more riots like those that erupted on friday and of more misery as a four-year-old recession grinds on. with new year celebrations canceled for fear of violence in the worst crisis since the country's last military coup in 1976, security chief juan jose alvarez said the capital had been strongly reinforced with patrols by the federal police, the coast guard and the border police.
