san francisco 1996-08-20 levi strauss & co. said tuesday it was launching a line of slacks meant to appeal to men who do_ n't like suits , in only the third major brand introduction in the company's 140-year history. the new slacks , to be called slates , will be marketed as dressier than the company's famous jeans or its dockers pants brand , but not as formal as suits. the pants , to be aimed at men in their 30s and 40s who grew up wearing levi's jeans and dockers khakis , are meant to give a big boost to the san francisco-based clothing company , though how well men accept the new line remains to be seen , industry analysts said. _ we_ 're going to awaken a sleeping giant of a category that we think has enormous potential , _ jann westfall , president of the slates brand , said in a statement. those men want something different to wear as the workplace gets more casual , _ a new look for business and social occasions that falls between casual cotton pants and suits , _ westfall said. the new line will come in a broad range of styles , colours and sizes , and the pants in most cases will not require tailoring , which levi hopes will lure men who want hassle-free shopping. he added that slacks are a small market with very few players , such as the haggar and farah brands. a research study done last year for the company showed that 85 percent of american companies that had a traditional dress code were now allowing some form of more casual attire in the workplace.
