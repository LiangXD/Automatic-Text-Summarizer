beijing, april 11 (afp) - china on thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the united states and taiwan, demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to us weapons sales. zhang further expressed alarm over washington's announcement wednesday that defense department officials will soon visit taiwan to discuss the sale of eight diesel electric submarines. china has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the united states and taiwan, zhang said. the visit, if beijing allows it, is widely expected to be centered on china's dissatisfaction over the taiwan issue. beijing has also long refused to establish diplomatic relations with any nation that maintains official contact with taiwan, although it has encouraged economic exchanges between taiwan and all nations. zhang also bashed remarks made last month by us deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz at a meeting in florida, attended by visiting taiwanese defense minister tang yao-ming. zhang said: the remarks of the us official are a... violation of us commitments made (on taiwan) and interference in china internal affairs.
