china's official xinhua news agency also weighed in sunday on bush's choice of words, accusing the president of orchestrating public opinion in advance of possible strikes against the three countries in an expansion of the war against terrorism. what the three states do share, it went on, is chilly relations with the united states. his remarks came on the last day of the munich conference on security, an invitation-only gathering of 400 international leaders who this year debated the war on terrorism. a diverse u.s delegation delivered a singular message to conference participants: nato remains vital and the united states needs a range of allies in the fight against terrorism and intends to consult its friends. sunday's final session also underscored the vast differences between the united states and russia. lindsey graham, r-s.c., asked ivanov why russia supported the former soviet republic of belarus with cheap energy subsidies, when the nation has "never had a democratic election and is a major exporter of arms and equipment." ivanov said there was no evidence belarus has sold arms to nations under sanction such as iraq, though it did do business with nations not under sanctions such as tajikistan, angola and "even gulf states."
