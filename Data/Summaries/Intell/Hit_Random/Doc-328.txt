canadarm2 lays track for space railway subhead: 'a unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment': improved mobility author: broward liston cape canaveral, fla. - the first railway in outer space was ready to roll yesterday after astronauts from the space shuttle atlantis prepped it for its inaugural run. the rail car, installed outside the international space station on the crew's first spacewalk, will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second, but ground controllers may not open up the throttle all the way in their first test today anyway. nasa said the mobile transporter, as the rail car is officially known, was ready for its first test today. the small trolley is designed to roll the station's canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another as work progresses on the station over the next several years. the massive robotic arm, canada's contribution to the multi-national space station, lifted the truss segment out and away from the shuttle's cargo bay and attached it on the station's laboratory module. the massive robotic arm, canada's contribution to the multi-national space station, lifted the truss segment out and away from the shuttle's cargo bay and attached it on the station's laboratory module. canadarm2 is a unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment, said capt.
