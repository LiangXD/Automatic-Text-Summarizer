it's gotten so busy around this once-sleepy caribbean outpost that the man in charge may soon restore the stoplight that, until navy downsizing in the 1990s, hung near the only mcdonalds in all of cuba. until a marine general arrived two weeks ago to run the prison project, buehn was the highest ranking officer here -- a cross between mayor, overseeing the schools, social clubs and 5k run on martin luther king day, and navy commander, in charge of this strategic air and sea refueling station. but he's not directly responsible for the nascent offshore u.s. terror compound, which, depending on whether the pentagon decides to stage military tribunals here, may one day make its nickname -- gitmo -- as notorious as devil's island. but buehn said the cubans have not raised any formal objections to the base's latest mission. most residents on the windward side -- among them, now, some 158 alleged terrorists flown in from afghanistan. were washington to decide to maintain guantanamo as an offshore terrorist detention center, buehn said, he would propose building a maximum security facility on leeward side. meanwhile, buehn is wondering what the latest mission will do to gitmo's image.
