mugabe wins poll, amid claims of rigging harare, march 13 (afp) - zimbabwe's long-time ruler robert mugabe swept to victory wednesday in presidential elections in a vote that challenger morgan tsvangirai declared was rigged and unacceptable. registrar general tobaiwa mudede announced on state television that mugabe was re-elected with 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,758 votes for tsvangirai, leader of the movement for democratic change (mdc). as the results were being announced, about 100 heavily armed soldiers moved into zimbabwe's second city bulawayao and surrounded the mdc offices, where opposition officials had gathered. british foreign secretary jack straw cited 'pretty strong' evidence that mugabe has 'stolen' zimbabwe's vote, an outcome he said would have 'enormous implications for the nature of our relationship with zimbabwe.' us state department spokeswoman lynn cassel said: 'while we must wait for the final results, it is abundantly clear that this was a seriously flawed election.' the mdc leadership was due to meet later wednesday to discuss the poll results, and tsvangirai was due to address a media conference afterwards. the mdc, charging that the mugabe government had followed a deliberate strategy of impeding the urban vote, went to the high court and won an extra day of voting on monday, but polls opened several hours late, and only an additional 24,000 votes were cast.
