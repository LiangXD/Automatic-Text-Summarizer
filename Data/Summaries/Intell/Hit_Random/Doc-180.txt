sas [special air service] soldiers and their american counterparts are fighting alongside the alliance as they have swept across large swathes afghanistan. but commons leader mr cook said: if you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put british troops into the ground civil war and i don't myself imagine that's going to change. we will continue obviously to keep the situation under review, but frankly, i think we should welcome the fact that their presence has not been needed in afghanistan. the city's top taliban commander was among thousands of afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting. the fall of kunduz leaves kandahar as the taliban's last major stronghold following the rapid collapse of their regime across the majority of the country. ruud lubbers, the united nations commissioner for refugees, said afghanistan was not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in and not enough food had been taken into the country. we are still in the middle of fighting the war in afghanistan.
