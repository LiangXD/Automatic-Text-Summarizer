the 110 al-qaeda and taliban prisoners admitted to gitmo by the end of last week are, said rumsfeld, the hardest of the hard core, men who had killed dozens and dozens of people. true, prisoners are now confined to 6-ft. by 8-ft. chain-link enclosures with concrete floors and tin roofs (rumsfeld thinks it's pejorative to call them cages). (the caution makes sense in 2000 mamdouh salim, an al-qaeda operative awaiting trial in new york city for his part in the 1998 embassy bombings, used a comb to stab a prison guard through the eye.) but in the european press, the prisoners' lot has become a public issue of contention among those who demand that u.s. conduct be above suspicion. under the geneva convention, those holding true pows are bound to release them at the end of hostilities but that is the last thing the u.s. wants to do with men who may be al-qaeda operatives. rumsfeld has laid out four options: a military trial, a trial in u.s. criminal courts, return to their home countries for prosecution, or continued detention while additional intelligence is gathered. this will be a big deal down there for at least two years, guaranteed, says army lieut. general b.b. bell who commands fort hood, texas, the base from which military police have been deployed to cuba.
