ministry criticizes 'odious' u.s. report the foreign ministry said thursday that it was surprised, to put it mildly by the u.s. state department's criticism of russia's human rights record and objected in particular to the odious section on chechnya. one gets the impression that its writers simply used old drafts, as if nothing had happened in either russia or the united states in recent years, as if the events of sept. russian officials from president vladimir putin on down have portrayed the conflict in chechnya as a war against international terrorists. u.s. officials have partially endorsed that view, pointing to rebel leaders such as shamil basayev and the jordanian-born omar ibn al khattab, who are believed to have financial and other ties to osama bin laden's al-qaida terrorist network. however, u.s. officials also note that some of the rebels do not have international ties, and they have criticized russian military and police abuse of civilians -- although the criticism was toned down greatly after russia became an enthusiastic member of the anti-terrorist coalition, sharing intelligence information, opening its airspace to humanitarian flights and giving a green light to u.s. military deployment in central asia. the foreign ministry said that the state department pronouncement on chechnya reflected the efforts of certain circles in the united states that object to the new u.s.-russian partnership against international terrorism. the ministry also suggested that before judging others' rights records, the united states should investigate the situation at home, including the government's failure to ratify some international human rights agreements and the use of the death penalty.
