israeli arab leaders yesterday pledged to fight a proposed 25%-30% cut in national insurance institute child benefits for those who have not served in the army or completed national service. shawqi khatib, chairman of the monitoring committee of the israeli arab leadership, said arabs would be hardest hit if the government approves the cutbacks in child benefits. those out of work now, who rely on benefits to support their families, will find themselves in an even worse situation, he said. this is likely to have ramifications for the future, with children skipping school, going out onto the streets, and getting mixed up with crime, drugs, and violence. they maintain that there are many women and young people who have lost their jobs in the last year who are either no longer registered or did not sign as jobless in the first place. i remember when the late prime minister yitzhaq rabin did away with the discrimination that had existed for years and equalized child benefits regardless of whether parents had served in the army or not, zaydan said. we applauded this move because it was not only just, but it made us begin to feel that we, as arabs, were an integral part of israeli society.
