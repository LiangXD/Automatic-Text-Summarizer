in a further move to bring in more overseas capital and shore up the won , the ministry said it would expand overseas borrowings by state banks. president kim young-sam , adding his weight to the liberalisation announcements , ordered his economic ministers to hasten access for foreign investors to the domestic capital market. _ the government should actively pursue measures to stabilise the foreign exchange market which faces difficulties due_to the expansion of a current account deficit , _ kim told economic ministers. in the past few weeks , speculators have been betting against the won , calculating the central bank is losing its ability to defend the currency due_to dwindling foreign exchange reserves. the government estimated the measures would attract an additional $8 billion this year , bringing foreign capital infow to $28 billion , instead_of an earlier estimated $20 billion. but economists warned the government was too optimistic. _ i doubt if foreign funds will really flow in as much as the government estimates , _ said an economist at the korea institute of finance , who declined to be identified. analysts welcomed the measures , but said immediate beneficiaries would be only a handful of blue chips as many foreigners were still concerned about the poor economic fundamentals. but economists and dealers said they did not believe monday's announcements would have a fundamental impact on the won. _ the moves will not reverse the dollar's bullishness , _ said a hana bank dealer. _ why should the won strengthen , when the dollar continues to rise in world markets ? _ the yield on three-year benchmark corporate bonds closed at 12.50 percent , down from 12.66 percent on saturday.
