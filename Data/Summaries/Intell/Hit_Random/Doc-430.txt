during the 1992 campaign, when gennifer flowers first brought clinton's philandering to public attention, stephanopoulos--as clinton's chief spinner, distracter, and all-around bullshit artist--played a crucial role in discrediting flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth, namely that clinton had a disturbing zipper problem. early in the film, with the flowers crisis in full bloom, sam donaldson interviews stephanopoulos, who blames it all on the republican attack machine. donaldson suggests that on 60 minutes clinton had admitted to infidelity. he said he had problems in his marriage, says stephanopoulos, correcting donaldson's deviation from the pre-scripted fudge-phrase of the day. near the end of the war room, stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of clinton paramours, which he is about to publicize. you might say that stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection techniques that seem to have made clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught. when democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of clinton, they don't need to look much further than the big lie about philandering that stephanopoulos, carville (and a cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992.
