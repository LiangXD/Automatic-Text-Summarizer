although these are sovereign states, and the final decision would have been in their hands, people familiar with the actual balance of power indicate that these states would have done nothing, had moscow wanted a different thing to happen. reformers told putin all along that he should take advantage of the rare opportunity for (russia) to become integrated with the civilized world. but main stream russian military policy has been to keep a distance from america, the country that has been historically responsible for educating the taliban that had caused the demise of soviet occupation forces in afghanistan. after the americans had promised everything good and nice, putin remarked almost as an aside that the events in chechnia could be interpreted only in the context of the struggle against international terrorism. in reality, putin asked for a free hand regarding chechnia, some understanding, or even that the americans look the other way. putin did not receive what he sought in a quick response from washington, namely, that the state department would continue to encourage political dialogue between moscow and the chechen insurgents. nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the united states called upon the chechens to unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups, and that they accept putin's offer to make peace.
