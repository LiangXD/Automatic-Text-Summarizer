elaborating on the 'axis of evil' president george bush's national security adviser condoleezza rice has recently defined the context and scope of the term axis of evil that bush used in his state of the union address a few weeks ago to describe iraq, iran and north korea. the rule, as far as human rights are concerned, is that every nation which does not enjoy pluralistic democracy is violating human rights and is therefore oppressive. one can name more than a dozen countries which are contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one speed or another. moreover, the us is the first and only nation ever to deploy such weapons. washington seems to be particularly disturbed and feel that its own national security is being threatened only when the nations which acquire mass destruction weapons are authoritarian or repressive, irrespective of the pace of amassing weaponry. this is, in fact, the fear of all countries, as they feel that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction. if this is the case, rice could have elaborated more precise criteria for membership in the axis of evil, by establishing more clearly the connection between the nature of the regime and the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.
