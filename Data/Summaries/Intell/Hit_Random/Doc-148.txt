us envoy retired general anthony zinni is to arrive in the region under circumstances similar to those that surrounded his first visit to palestine and israel. the israeli government works to abort his mission in advance by storming palestinian territories, assassinating citizens it alleges have links to security activities, and arresting innocent citizens. palestinians, during zinni's presence in the region, abided by calm and cease-fire and are doing the same now. the world community, however, believes that in their struggle for liberation and independence, palestinians seek negotiations for a peaceful settlement as a strategic option and a legitimate rejection of israel's colonialism, imposed on the palestinian people by force for more than 34 years now. the israeli government says it should have a free hand to storm the palestinian areas assassinate or arrest palestinian citizens demolish homes, headquarters, and establishments uproot thousands of trees and besiege cities and villages as it likes. while committing themselves to peace, palestinians bear this patiently and suppress fury, hoping that the us-dominated world community will acknowledge that palestinians seek calm and a just peace in order to end occupation and settlement in their territories and to enjoy freedom, dignity, and independence, like other world nations. us envoy zinni is supposed to have realized these clear-cut facts through his reading of the latest developments in the region.
