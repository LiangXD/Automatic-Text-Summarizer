clearly, if it were not for our relations with the us, we would be protesting his continued imprisonment without proper trial, says justice john dowd, a former conservative attorney general who is also president of the australian chapter of the international commission of jurists. the us government classifies the men as illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, and therefore they don't have the rights laid out in the geneva convention. opposition justice spokesman darryl melham says the australian government's refusal to demand consular access to its citizen compares poorly with british foreign secretary jack straw's immediate insistence that three british nationals captured with al qaeda should face neither a military tribunal nor the death penalty. british officials have visited the british captives at guantanamo bay and said they have no complaints about their treatment, which contrasts greatly with the feelings expressed in some of the british press. you will have people saying why are different standards being applied, on the basis of nationality, for what appears to be the same offenses. they have been trained to be terrorists and to act in accordance with the objective of al qaeda. you're now getting a lot of callers saying he is an australian citizen, and australia is not the 51st state of america, she says.
