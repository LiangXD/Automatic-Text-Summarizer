the session of the united nations framework convention for climate change held this time was to reach on an actual agreement regarding regulatory problems that have to be solved to put the kyoto protocol adopted in 1997 into force, so that the world may reduce the greenhouse effect and ecological damage, which are becoming more serious with each passing day, protect human lives and health, and provide favorable conditions for the promotion of human civilization. for the kyoto protocol to enter into force, 55 countries have to ratify it. for the kyoto protocol to enter into force, 55 countries have to ratify it. it was expected that the protocol would be ratified by the countries that signed it and would have a legal binding force. nonetheless, japan, changing its stand this time, opposed the draft regulations to put the kyoto protocol into force and even called for liquidation of the draft. since japan has no spirit of independence and has always acted on us directions, japan had continued to put off diet ratification of the protocol and took such an attitude at the un session held this time, under the plausible pretext that it would be meaningless to put the kyoto protocol into force, if the united states were excluded. what japan is doing with respect to the issue of putting the kyoto protocol into force is tantamount to an act of betrayal against mankind in the effort to protect human lives, health, and the earth's atmosphere.
