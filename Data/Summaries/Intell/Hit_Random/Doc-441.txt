we've worked hard to structrue the organization so that we've ready to move boldly into the next century, and i believe that we have an exciting and successful future ahead of us. it's clear that if we don't increase our base of private funding, we won't have the kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers and the very important services they offer. the community initiatives committee is working with our development office to put together a long-range fundraising plan that will ultimately bring more money into our centers. with this in mind, i am asking each one of you to make a personal contribution of $50, $100 or even $1,000 to show that you believe in the work that we do and are willing to support it with both your time and your finances. i also encourage you to seek additional support through your company, church, or service organization. i know that our staff and committee members will be happy to go with you to talk to these group if you need their help. your financial support of the development process is just one step in making cci a stronger, more efficient and ultimately more effective federation of service providers.
