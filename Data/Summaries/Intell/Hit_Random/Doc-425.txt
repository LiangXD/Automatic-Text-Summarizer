i think that is why i welcomed doing a book--it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism. think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories. much of it, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some very good stories. from where i am sitting, i think the microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age. i think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it's clear that the balance of power is shifting again, although it not clear where it will land. or will it be none of them because the internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate? i always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whether it is aol or microsoft or disney--is in charge of all our destinies: babylon was.
