ritsuko shimizu tokyo 1997-03-31 japan announced a range of measures on monday to try to jump start its long-stalled real estate market , a move analysts called a good first step but hardly the final answer to the problem. forming the backbone of the package was the easing of rules that would allow real estate held as collateral to be turned into securities to be sold to investors. huge , unrealised losses in real estate are seen by many analysts as being at the core of japan's financial traumas. other measures include the use of public money to buy up land for public development projects , such as old-age homes , day-care centres and parks , as_well_as the easing of zoning and other regulations to promote such projects. _ even if they only achieve 60 percent , it_ 's still pretty significant , _ said darrel whitten , a strategist at lehman brothers japan. _ it_ 's not an end-all solution but it_ 's a step in the right direction , _ he said. many of the bad loans were made in the 1980s _ bubble era _ of sky-high stock and land prices to the real estate sector , with property used as collateral. the ministry of finance said trust banks would be allowed to issue securities linked to real estate business loans immediately , while rules allowing the establishment of special purpose companies to handle such securities would be introduced in the fiscal year starting from april 1 , 1998. the ministry of finance said bodies such as the housing loan administration corp , which administers the debts of failed _ jusen _ housing loan companies , would present a list of around 380 billion yen ( $3.06 billion ) worth of property to the government to be considered for public development. _ the situation is already an inferno but the government has only got to the stage of ordering a fire engine , _ said an analyst at a real estate research institute.
