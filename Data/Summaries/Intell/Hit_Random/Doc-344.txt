"thanks to the people of zimbabwe for loudly saying: never again shall zimbabwe be a colony," mugabe said. "it is our people who decide, who must say so, not you, sirs and not the one person in 10 downing st., tony blair," mugabe said, referring to britain's prime minister. south african president thabo mbeki and nigerian president olusegun obasanjo are pressing mugabe to accept such an arrangement to avoid deepening international sanctions and suspension from the commonwealth of britain and its former colonies. as the leader of the region's most robust economy and most respected democracy, many western leaders are looking to mbeki to denounce the results and provide some reassurance that the continent is committed to democratic principles and property rights.
