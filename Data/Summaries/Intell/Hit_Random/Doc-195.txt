london, jan 18 (afp) -- british officials have arrived at guantanamo bay, cuba and are assessing the conditions of three british prisoners among the 110 suspected al-qa'ida fighters held there by the us, the foreign office said on friday. a foreign office spokesman said: i can confirm a team of british officials are in the process of visiting the detainees at guantanamo bay. they are going about their task that has been set for them, identifying those who claim to be british citizens and reporting on the welfare of those who claim to be british citizens and assisting the us authorities with legal inquiries into the terrorist atrocities. the united states earlier this week said british diplomats could have access to britons held among the detainees, whose cramped and spartan conditions have caused much criticism among human rights groups around the world. london insists it supports us reassurances that the men are being treated humanely, although there has also been criticism here over why it was taking diplomats so long to see the men. the prisoners are being held at a temporary outdoor detention facility called camp x-ray where each has a separate cell with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls. a four-member international red cross team flew into the us navy base on cuban soil on thursday and was due to begin interviewing detainees later friday.
