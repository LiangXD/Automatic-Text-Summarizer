geneva, jan 18 (afp) -- a report by delegates from the international committee of the red cross (icrc), currently visiting prisoners from afghanistan held at a us base in cuba, will remain confidential, an icrc spokesman said on friday [18 january]. icrc envoys are discussing with us officials whether to release the number of detainees and their nationalities, said christen. as long as this confidentiality will allow us to get results in the humanitarian sphere we will keep to it, he said, adding it would be the first of a series of visits. the four-member team, which includes a doctor, will inspect conditions and treatment of the increasing number of taliban and al-qa'ida prisoners arriving at the base from afghanistan. the icrc considers, however, that they are prisoners of war protected by the third geneva convention of 1949. christen said detainees from the battle field did not exist as a category under humanitarian law, adding that in an international armed conflict anyone captured on the battlefield was presumed a prisoner of war. if a doubt exists as to the status of a person, this doubt must be decided by a tribunal acting on the basis of judicial guarantees, he added.
