this grand bargain to uplift the world's poorest continent would have been in jeopardy if thabo mbeki, south africa's president, and olusegun obasanjo, nigeria's president, had not agreed to suspend zimbabwe from the 54-nation group of former british colonies known as the commonwealth. mr. mbeki may still hope that, despite his joining the west in criticizing zimbabwean leader robert mugabe, he can work with his troubled neighbor to prevent more violence, keep the economy from collapsing, and find some political compromise. mbeki and other african leaders need to press mr. mugabe to stop his repression and to not take farmland from whites without just compensation. a strike this week by the country's trade unions protesting the government's tactics reflects widespread disgust with mugabe. but now that he's cornered by the international community with many types of isolation - including opprobrium from two of his african peers - he has lashed out by charging opposition leader morgan tsvangirai with trying to kill him. such desperation by mugabe should not be condoned by african leaders. his stature in africa and his stand on zimbabwe's future bring hope for african economic renewal and greater democracy. back to top untitled copyright @ 2002 the christian science monitor.
