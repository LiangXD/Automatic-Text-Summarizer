mugabe, who is from the ruling zimbabwe african national union-patriotic front (zanu-pf), won last weekend's presidential election by polling 1,685,212 against his closest rival morgan tsvangirai of the movement for democratic change (mdc) who polled 1,262,401 votes. he said the program, under which the government was taking over idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of zimbabwe's arable land, to resettle landless blacks, would form the centerpiece of his efforts to revive the economy. in the run-up to the march 9-11 poll, critics had accused the zimbabwean leader of stirring up the emotive land issue merely to garner support in the country's closest-fought election since independence in 1980. many african leaders have supported mugabe's re-election victory in zimbabwe's crucial election, which they said was transparent, credible, free and fair. however, mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity, incorporating his closest rival in the poll, to ensure political and economic stability in zimbabwe. south african president thabo mbeki and president olusegun obasanjo are expected in harare monday for talks with the zimbabwean leader on a possible government of national unity. diplomats here said a government of national unity was partly intended to allow britain and the united states to save face over their insistence on the mdc' s victory in zimbabwe's election.
