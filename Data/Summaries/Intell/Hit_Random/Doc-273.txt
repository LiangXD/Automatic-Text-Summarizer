courtaulds plc announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value. the british chemical and textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create a new, listed u.k. stock with a probable market capitalization between #300 million ($473 million) and #400 million, analysts said. courtaulds' spinoff reflects pressure on british industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders. courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including australian financier kerry packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year. though mr. packer has since sold his stake, courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy. even without a specific takeover threat, courtaulds is giving shareholders choice and value, said julia blake, an analyst at london stockbrokers barclays de zoete wedd. the sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders, customers and employees.
