it's hard to believe that the holiday season is only two months away. at pleasant run, inc. we are making plans and arrangements for our children and families. but, the holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families. they do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a holiday meal. we are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this holiday season. if you are interested and would like more information, please contact lisa lusk or marcia whited at 693-9222. thank you for considering this opportunity to make this a memorable holiday season for a family in need.
