harare, zimbabwe: a defiant president robert mugabe said his party had lost ground to the opposition through complacency, but would win this weekend's presidential elections anyway, state radio reported on tuesday. the fledgling mdc won 57 of 120 elected seats in june 2000 parliamentary elections as mugabe's popularity plunged amid economic devastation and chaos. security forces tortured opponents, ruling party militants abducted people, and police arrested opposition supporters who were themselves the victims of crimes. in his speech on monday, mugabe thanked african leaders for refusing to buckle to pressure to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth of britain and its former territories at a summit of the 54-nation grouping in australia. foreign diplomats based in harare said monday police prevented them from finishing a meeting on monday with mdc leader morgan tsvangirai. police declared the meeting with about 35 ambassadors and members of their staffs illegal under new security laws requiring police permission for political gatherings. tsvangirai called the meeting to discuss food shortages gripping zimbabwe and measures his party was considering to combat them, diplomats said.
