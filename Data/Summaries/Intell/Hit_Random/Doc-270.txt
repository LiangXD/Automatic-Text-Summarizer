dow jones & co. extended its tender offer of $18 a share, or about $576 million, for the 33% of telerate inc. that it doesn't already own until 5 p.m. the supplement contains various information that has been filed with the securities and exchange commission since dow jones launched the offer on sept. in delaware chancery court litigation, telerate has criticized dow jones for not disclosing that telerate's management expects the company's revenue to increase by 20% annually, while dow jones based its projections of telerate's performance on a 12% revenue growth forecast. in the tender offer supplement, dow jones discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20% growth rate as a hoped-for goal of telerate's management and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company's likely future performance. dow jones has said it believes the $18-a-share price is fair to telerate's minority shareholders. late last week, representatives of dow jones and telerate began negotiations about the terms of the offer, but those talks didn't result in any changes in the offer. dow jones, which owns 67% of telerate, publishes the wall street journal, barron's magazine, community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases.
