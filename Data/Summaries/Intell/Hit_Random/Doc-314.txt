venezuela's new dawn bbc correspondent in caracas venezuelans awoke on friday to a country transformed by the dramatic and violent events of the last 24 hours, which left at least 11 people dead and more than 80 injured. a general strike and an escalating oil industry stoppage that had threatened to cripple the country's economy were no more - and the country not only had a new president, business leader pedro carmona, but a new name. his second was to announce the end of the three-day general strike he had called with the head of the confederation of venezuelan workers (ctv) leader carlos ortega in support of protesting managers from state oil company pdvsa. eyewitness euridice ledesma said snipers fired on the marchers from rooftops near the palace. in the early hours of the morning, chief of the armed forces general lucas rincon held a brief news conference to say mr chavez's resignation had been demanded and accepted. news of mr chavez's resignation caused hundreds of flag-waving and whistle-blowing venezuelans to surround the city's air force base, la carlota, in the hope of seeing mr chavez' departure from the country. but there's also a feeling of uncertainty about how the country's obvious problems are going to be solved, said ms ledesma.
