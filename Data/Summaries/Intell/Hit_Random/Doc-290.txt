already, washington's refusal to grant them official prisoner-of- war status has sparked protests from human rights groups, and a disagreement with the international committee of the red cross (icrc), which oversees the geneva conventions. under the third geneva convention, prisoners of war may only be tried in the same courts and according to the same rules, as soldiers of the country that is holding the prisoners. us attorney general john ashcroft said tuesday that the administration would seek criminal charges in a civil court against the american taliban prisoner john walker lindh, rather than send him to a military tribunal. human rights organizations, however, have raised questions about the prisoners' housing conditions, which according to the geneva convention should be the same standard of those enjoyed by their guards. meanwhile pentagon legal experts are currently working on a procedure to decide on the prisoners' fate. i don't think anything quite like this was envisioned when the geneva conventions were drawn up, says tom farer, dean of denver university's graduate school of international studies and a former special assistant to the defense department's special counsel. i don't think anything quite like this was envisioned when the geneva conventions were drawn up, says tom farer, dean of denver university's graduate school of international studies and a former special assistant to the defense department's special counsel.
