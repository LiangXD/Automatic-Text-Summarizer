the cross-party parliamentary human rights committee said it was lobbying for a meeting with us ambassador to london william farish over fears that the 110 detainees held at camp x-ray, guantanamo bay, are being kept in inhumane conditions. the united states says the detainees are illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, and thus do not have rights under the geneva convention of 1949, which sets out the laws of war. ann clwyd, chairperson for the committee and a member of the ruling labour party, said it was playing with words to suggest that the detainees were not prisoners of war. clwyd said the purpose of meeting farish was to to voice concern about the treatment of all the people taken prisoner in afghanistan, not just the ones being held in cuba, and we want an acceptance that they are prisoners of war. she added that there was substantial concern among labour members and called for a government statement on the situation. it's time we had a clear statement on the position of the prisoners and what the british role now is. the government has sent a team of officials to the camp to assess the conditions of the british prisoners.
