they have absurdly criticized as inhumane the decision to temporarily place prison suits, handcuffs and blindfolds on the terrorists during transfer to protect the military personnel guarding them. they enjoy their own large cell, talking freely with one another, worshiping with a prayer leader, and writing home. by way of contrast, the men and women of our military who have the extremely dangerous job of guarding these thugs live in 12-person tents, take cold showers using a hose, and often must cope without the benefits of electricity. i have no doubt that, if given the opportunity, any of the detainees would have relished the chance to kill me. indeed, since their arrival at camp-x-ray, some of the terrorists have openly threatened the marines who guard them and talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing the american people. in the caves and hideouts of al qaeda operatives, we have found instruction books on how to build chemical and biological weapons, detailed maps of american cities and descriptions of landmarks. in the caves and hideouts of al qaeda operatives, we have found instruction books on how to build chemical and biological weapons, detailed maps of american cities and descriptions of landmarks.
