a national survey, the first government study of its kind on distracted driving, and other data released thursday by the national highway traffic safety administration underscore the difficulty authorities face in discouraging texting and cellphone talking while driving. at any given moment last year on america's streets and highways, nearly one in every 100 car drivers was texting, emailing, surfing the web or otherwise using a hand-held electronic device, the safety administration said. the agency also takes an annual snapshot of drivers' behavior behind the wheel by staking out intersections to count people using cellphones and other devices, as well as other distracting behavior.while electronic gadgets are in ever greater use by drivers, motorists are deeply conflicted about it, a nhtsa survey of over 6,000 drivers found. most said they would answer a cellphone call while driving and continue to drive after answering. the increase in texting while driving came even though many states have banned the practice, and that's alarming, said jonathan adkins, a spokesman for the governors highway safety association. the safety administration reported earlier this year that pilot projects in syracuse, n.y., and hartford, conn., produced significant reductions in distracted driving by combining stepped-up ticketing with high-profile public education campaigns. safety researchers generally attribute the lower deaths to a decline in driving because of the poor economy combined with better designed and equipped cars and stronger safety laws.
