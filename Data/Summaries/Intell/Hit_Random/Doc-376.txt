21 - the deadly riots in argentina, the collapse of its government and another multibillion dollar bailout gone awry have raised fresh questions about the effectiveness of the international monetary fund and the financial policies of the united states, the fund's leading shareholder. some say the monetary fund showed callousness by failing to give new aid to argentina early this month, as the country's economic program, designed with i.m.f. approval, was forcing painful austerity measures on its citizens. peru's finance minister, pedro pablo kuczynski, complained today that the fund bungled its dealings with argentina by adopting inconsistent policies that were at turns passive and inflexible. the french, who like the united states are significant fund shareholders, have called on the lending agency to step up its involvement to help argentina recover. if argentina got its core economic policies right, it would have avoided this problem, said charles calomiris, a finance and economics professor at columbia university who has been sounding the alarm about argentina for months. moreover, it is difficult to place blame for argentina's economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy was designed by argentina itself, sometimes over the objections of the fund's economists. argentina, however, was determined to pay its debts in full and keep its fixed currency in place, fulfilling what it viewed as a promise to its citizens and creditors who had been told for years that pesos were as good as dollars.
