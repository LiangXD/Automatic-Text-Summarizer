we can't solve all of the country's problems in three weeks, he told local radio, hours after tens of thousands of argentines took to the streets around the country in a pot-banging demonstration. duhalde, who took office on january 2 as argentina's fifth president in a month, vowed his government would unveil a new economic program to rescue the country from four years of recession. daily protests have engulfed argentina: popular rage has boiled over against duhalde's decision to devalue the peso by more than 30 percent and further tighten a banking freeze that has locked most argentines' savings into bank accounts. the beleaguered president made no mention of the widely despised banking freeze that has presented a nettlesome challenge to his three-week-old administration: how to give argentines their savings back without prompting an all-out collapse of the financial system. the banking curbs were put in place december 1 by then-president fernando de la rua to halt a run on the banks. but after the devaluation of the peso, many banks say they simply don't have the money to return to depositors. under a driving rain, more than 10,000 argentines banged pots and pans in the plaza de mayo to protest the banking freeze, shouting insults at the country's political leaders, the supreme court, and banks - all of whom the argentines blame for plunging the country into its worst economic crisis in decades.
