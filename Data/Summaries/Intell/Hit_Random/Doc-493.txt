finance minister pedro malan insisted yesterday on the need for a more profound constructive engagement on the part of multilateral institutions and governments in helping argentina. given the degree of uncertainty that prevails over the inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates and over the economy's real gross domestic product (gdp) this year, the approach should not be the traditional one, the finance minister says. this, the minister insists, is why it makes no sense to demand that everything be done in one or two weeks, referring to what the imf and some governments, like that of the united states, are asking. according to the minister, mercosur managed, after an enormous technical effort,' something that did not exist in the region two years ago - the harmonization of the statistics of the member countries, bolivia and chile, which were not comparable before. whoever says that these are small steps is incapable of recognizing the european union's experience, the minister says. the finance minister says he hopes, for mercosur, something similar to what happened in the eu: an ability to look decades ahead and not let oneself get beaten down, like in some countries that dedicate themselves to lamenting, that see the difficulties as being insurmountable, and the problems as being unsolvable. the minister says that after the october elections in brazil, it will be necessary to make more progress in the process of making changes to which the country has been committed over the past years.
