peronist to head argentina at least till march elections buenos aires - veteran peronist adolfo rodriguez saa was set to become the country's interim president yesterday, taking power after a devastating economic crisis toppled president fernando de la rua. taking on a job many in his own peronist party spurned, rodriguez saa is expected to serve as president at least until new elections, tentatively scheduled for march 3. a populist who has ruled a western arid province for 18 years, rodriguez saa will have to deal with an economy on the brink of defaulting on its $132 billion public debt and struggling with more than 18 percent unemployment. rodriguez saa yesterday told the television network todo noticias he would announce an economic plan to ease the crisis. argentines wary of surging unemployment, rising poverty, salary cuts and tax hikes are deeply skeptical of more calls for belt-tightening, the centerpiece of policies advocated by de la rua and his economy minister domingo cavallo. no more austerity plans! said pablo arteaga, a 36-year-old dentist whose wife is a state worker whose salary has fallen by 13 percent in recent months. he complained that it was the peronists who forced him from office by disregarding his call to join a government of national unity - his last-ditch effort to remain in office after the declaration of a state of emergency failed to quell the rioting.
