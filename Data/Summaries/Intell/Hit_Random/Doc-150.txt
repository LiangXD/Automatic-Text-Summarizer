president hugo chavez has warned that certain sectors have once again taken up the idea of looking forceful way out in venezuela, either through a coup or an attack that would end his life. since they have realized that this train is not stopping and that they are not going to stop it or run it off the track, ideas about destabilization have once again surfaced. the president charged that attacks targeting his person have gone on for over 10 years, and that he has been accused, among other things, of ties with the guerrillas, of buying arms and trying to set up a communist regime in venezuela. he pointed out that his annoyance does not extend to the journalists, but is directed at the owners of newspapers and radio and television broadcasting stations. the chief of state also recalled that the previous governments viewed the colombian guerrillas as enemies of venezuela, which led to operations in colombian territory to attack the rebel groups. in his opinion, this was a serious error that resulted in victims and loss of venezuelan lives because we were meddling directly in an internal conflict in colombia. [quotation marks as published] we were meddling in an internal conflict of another country, which is a violation of international law and which in turn gave the guerrillas the right to attack our military units.
