here's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely source: goodwill's controller, juli. after maureen's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant, we helped maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society. sherry learned through our future works class that she could rise out of the mire of the welfare system and support her family. your gift to goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their own stories of success. your support will help them go to work. sincerely, william a carter, chairman goodwill industries foundation p.s. your gift is a wise investment in the community. that money was then spent in a variety of ways, adding fuel to our thriving economy.
