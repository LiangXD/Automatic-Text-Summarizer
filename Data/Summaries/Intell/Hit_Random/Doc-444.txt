i can tell you we need your help now as much as ever before. it seems summer options aren't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes, so we're doing all we can to make jameson available. these 60 or so campers have takenon a fund raiser with a goal of raising $16,000 for camperships. two of them told me yesterday that as a group they decided they had to earn the right to ask others for help by accomplishing something real to help themselves. and that's from kids many people see as a problem. please, consider renewing your support of these great kids today. if you can give a little more to help meet this increased expense we would appreciate your support.
