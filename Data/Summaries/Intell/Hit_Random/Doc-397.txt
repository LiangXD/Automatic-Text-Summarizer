britain's prescott pushes for kyoto pact backing vancouver, british columbia -- the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be ratified even without u.s. support, british deputy prime minister john prescott told an international conference on business and the environment on friday. prescott said that while the u.s. decision to reject the kyoto agreement is a cause for concern, pressure will be maintained on the bush administration to go further with its current voluntary emission-reduction targets. prescott, britain's front man in pushing the accord, said the united states until recently was critical of the science that led to the kyoto pact but has now accepted it, and he remains optimistic that the goals of the united states and of other signatory nations would converge. prescott said the british program aims to cut emissions by 20 percent, and the country is now half way to that goal. the issue has pitted business groups, who claim the accord will hurt the global economy, against environmentalists, who warn of the dire effects from global warming such as higher ocean levels and destruction of various plants and animal species. prescott came to anderson's support on friday, agreeing that financial figures quoted by kyoto opponents in canada about the potential damage to the canadian economy were pure fiction. a study by the canadian manufacturers and exporters association said the accord would cost the canadian economy up to c$40 billion by 2010, but a dutch report released earlier this week said it would only be c$727 million.
