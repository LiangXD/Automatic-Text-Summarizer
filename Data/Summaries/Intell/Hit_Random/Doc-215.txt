that world which had looked in tears at the photos and the pictures of september 11, the towers collapsing, and the infamy against civilization, and which is now discovering these other photos, the first ones to come out of camp x-ray, the open-air prison which the united states has set up at guantanamo base, their historic outpost on the island of cuba. but the photos of 'gitmo' are now in danger of removing the united states from the niche of affection and solidarity which september 11 had guaranteed it in the hearts of many people. the bbc has been posing questions about those photos which are stirring up protests, and many people believe them to be a scandal : photos taken in part at the landing of the c17s after the trip from afghanistan, which already showed the prisoners reduced to objects, with gags, masked goggles, and ear muffs. as for the rest, they are raising the objection of reason of state, and an emergency which is definitely not over: since september 11, 1,500 suspected terrorists have been captured in 50 countries, but the intelligence services claim that at least 10,000 affiliates of al-qa'ida are still scattered across the world, their network all around us. and, around this small piece of the united states, the cuba of old man castro, who up until now has not batted an eyelid, and has renounced using the scandal of x-ray and attacking the 'hated yankees' with his propaganda, relying on the possible end of the embargo against his regime. kenneth roth, of human rights watch, claims that this policy could offer a pretext to less democratic countries among those countries which are allies of the americans, to suppress any domestic dissent. kenneth roth, of human rights watch, claims that this policy could offer a pretext to less democratic countries among those countries which are allies of the americans, to suppress any domestic dissent.
