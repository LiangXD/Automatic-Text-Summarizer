seeking an ethical watchdog for the genetic scientists by tom wilkie in a rare display of consensus last week , industry , consumers _' organisations and the environmental movement called for a national committee to examine the social and ethical implications of biotechnology and genetic engineering of plants and animals , tom wilkie writes. ms foster put forward the idea of a similar investigation for plant and animal biotechnology because she was troubled by the unnecessary secrecy and seeming insensitivity of government departments to issues other than the narrow technical one of safety. the suggestion was supported both by companies involved in biotechnology and by environmental groups. in stark contrast , industry seems almost eager to put all its cards on the table. keith pike , a manager of ici seeds , told the meeting that & bquo industry likes to know where it stands. if its research is successful , it should mean the end of mass-produced tomatoes that are tasteless because they are picked before they are fully ripe to prevent wastage during handling. if the product is approved , genetically engineered tomatoes could be on the supermarket shelves by 1993.
