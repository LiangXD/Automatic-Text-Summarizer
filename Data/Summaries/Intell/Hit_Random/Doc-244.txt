gm class h, which represents a dividend interest in hughes earnings, closed at $29, up 25 cents in big board composite trading. the earnings drop at gm hughes electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of hughes aircraft co. and gm's north american automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the delco electronics corp. side of the gm hughes unit. profit at the unit fell to $110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $24 million one-time charge associated with hughes's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end. that decline was reflected in revenue for the gm hughes unit, which edged down to $2.58 billion from $2.63 billion. at eds, third-quarter profit jumped 16% to a record $110.9 million, or 93 cents a share, from $95.9 million, or 79 cents a share. revenue from non-gm accounts was 45% of eds's total business in the latest nine months, compared with 40% a year earlier. the company has said it wants to boost non-gm revenue to at least 50% of its total business by the end of 1990.
