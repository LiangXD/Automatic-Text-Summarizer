john c. marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5% annually through the next three years. in the past 20 months alone, paul e. lego, president and chief operating officer, said the divestiture of $300 million of slow-growth, low-profit businesses has been more than offset by $600 million in profitable acquisitions. while westinghouse hasn't had a nuclear power plant order from a u.s. utility in about a decade, excess capacity is beginning to shrink. westinghouse also is well positioned to sell steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers. the company's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with mitsubishi heavy industries, mr. lego said. company officials also said that any gain from the sale of westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the swiss firm of asea brown boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. capital expenditure in 1990 will rise slightly, mr. marous said, from an estimated $470 million this year.
