link: [comments: s1 provides the link for the stabilisation plan ] _ bulbank would open a credit line to provide $50 million to the government for the stabilisation of biochim bank and the government is to begin talks with foreign banks for biochim bank's management , _ the press centre said. under the stabilisation plan the finance ministry would issue $50 million of 18-month t-notes , which will be bought out by bulbank , bulgaria's biggest and most stable state-owned bank. the issue is to be backed through proceeds from future privatisation deals and would bear a semi-annual coupon pegged to the libor , bulbank's chief executive director chavdar kanchev said earlier this month. the principal would be redeemed at maturity. the operation would also involve a buy-back of $50 million worth of dollar-denominated domestic bad debt ( zunk ) bonds from the biochim bank's portfolio by the ministry. biochim bank would then buy bad debt bonds from the central bank's portfolio well below their minimum acceptable price with part of the money and possibly resell them later at a higher price to boost its capital , a finance ministry official said. biochim bank is the only operating local state bank with a negative capital net worth and suffers a serious liquidity shortage that needs to be compensated from the budget and the central bank , bankers said.
