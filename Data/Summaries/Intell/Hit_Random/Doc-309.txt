what they said: no tears for tobin, but some for al-qaeda ottawa - the plight of prisoners and politicians has been weighing heavily on the minds of editorial writers and pundits in and around the nation's capital. it's been a week now since jean chretien's cabinet shuffle and the dramatic departure of brian tobin -- seven days during which the print pundits have had time to ponder his actions. we can't help but wonder if some politicians and civil rights advocates are overreacting when it comes to the treatment of captured al-qaeda and taliban fighters by the united states. no one, however, is giving a hearty thumbs up to mr. tobin. no tears will be shed in this corner since brian tobin's departure represents his third consecutive betrayal of voters, walter robinson, federal director of the canadian taxpayers federation and a regular columnist in the ottawa sun wrote yesterday. with some effort, he pins the flailing child down on the changing table only to discover there are no diapers in the house. by day seven, however, ms. harris-adler notes that though mr. tobin has finally mastered the diapering process, his baby who is 15 years old is not amused.
