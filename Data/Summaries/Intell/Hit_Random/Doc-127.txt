that is a bitter pill to swallow in a thoroughly non-militaristic society such as ours, where the clash of weapons provokes healthy reactions of repulsion. in the battle against the new forms of terrorism that reached a tragic culmination on 11 september, a limited form of military violence could also not be ruled out. the network with which usama bin ladin and his followers tried to destroy the very foundations of the west has ramifications worldwide, vast amounts of money, and thanks to the taliban regime in afghanistan also a number of excellent training and attack bases. they took pains to build a broad coalition, and tried to make it clear to their own population and the international community that the enemy is not islam but a very well defined and perverse interpretation of this religion. but they cannot be any real talk of success until the broad strategy against terrorism begins to bear fruit. there is a real danger that the wounded but not yet eliminated network will play its trump card and commit further acts of terrorism. the economic impact of the 11 september attacks was already disastrous, with clear effects on the world economy, hitting the poorest countries by far the most.
