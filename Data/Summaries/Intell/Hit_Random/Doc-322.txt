it would cost alberta somewhere between $3-billion and $6-billion. they stand with empty pockets and their hands empty, out toward alberta, and at the same time they're criticizing alberta. canadians know, with a certainty approaching perfection, that the federal government is incompetent when it comes to offering even order-of-magnitude guesses. historically, nearly all temperature data have been collected from urban heat islands and, as new zealand climatologist vincent gray observed, all measurements of global temperature that are made far from human habitation show no sign of any warming. historically, nearly all temperature data have been collected from urban heat islands and, as new zealand climatologist vincent gray observed, all measurements of global temperature that are made far from human habitation show no sign of any warming. last spring the american national academy of science warned that because there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally, any estimates of either the magnitude or the direction of future warming must be highly tentative. in short, because the estimates of the scale and timing of atmospheric warming are so uncertain, it is just not possible to assess the costs and benefits.
