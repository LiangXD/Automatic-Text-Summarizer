caracas (afp) -- the venezuelan military high command maintains its support for president hugo chavez despite calls from the opposition to take part in an indefinite general strike declared wednesday night [10 april], and despite the individual acts of insubordination of two generals on that same day, one of them in command of no troops. he was followed by division general rafael damiani, from the militarized national guard (gn), who condemned the fact that president chavez ordered troops to use force in putting down a demonstration in caracas in support of the striking managers of the state-owned pdvsa [venezuelan petroleum, inc.]. however, the high military commands supported the government during the emergency caused by the strike staged by the trade union and business association opposition, a strike that was extended indefinitely on wednesday night, according to carlos ortega, president of the venezuelan workers confederation (ctv), the largest labor confederation in the country. the second rebel, gn div gen damiani, accused chavez of having ordered the national guard to use force for the purpose of removing individuals positioned in front of one of the pdvsa buildings in chuao in this capital. however, datanalisis analyst leon indicated that even though chavez still controls the military forces at the present time, this fact constitutes no permanent life insurance, since the current indefinite general strike called by the opposition ctv and the fedecamaras [venezuelan federation of associations and chambers of commerce and industry] leadership is only one battle in a war that he predicts will be a long one. leon added that the opposition has viewed the pdvsa conflict as the perfect lifesaver for reviving civilian social pressure for chavez' ouster from power, this following a cooling of such pressure in recent days. leon visualizes two scenarios: in the first, tension will increase in the days ahead, but not destabilize the government, then dwindle toward the end of the week and generate frustration among the opposition over not achieving its objective, a factor that would in turn strengthen chavez.
