the most important of the three conferences, which subsequently gained even more prominence, was the conference in genova perhaps even more so for the results not obtained at the conference, and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting. because, from the very start it could be predicted that on the subject of economic globalization, the developed and capitalist states were going to come across fierce opposition by dissident groups and the supporters of economic growth in poor countries. regarding the american proposed anti-missile defense system too, neither russia, china, japan, nor even the european union, had shown any enthusiasm rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project. whereas, beforehand, it was anticipated and hoped that the agreements reached at genoa would help bring about beneficial results for the bonn conference as well. in the remarks made by these political leaders, one point is interesting and calls for reflection: if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations, while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them, then it must be said that they are only the elected [leaders] of their own nation [people], and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide! [exclamation mark as published] to recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of new york and genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely. as regards the recent conference (bonn meeting), although the past gatherings like the hague meeting and kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences, nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious, one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts, and implementation of the agreements, even though they are not protected by any sanctions.
