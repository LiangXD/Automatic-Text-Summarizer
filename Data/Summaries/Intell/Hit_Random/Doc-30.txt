slow progress in the war on diabetes : nicholas russell says investigative research may beat flashy technology by nicholas russell one in 50 britons suffers from sugar diabetes and , despite 100 years of scientific study , we still do not know how it is caused. it is unlikely that further knowledge will improve treatment , but it may allow prevention of the disease , at_least in a proportion of cases. in theory there are two distinct versions of the disease. when insulin was isolated at the toronto medical school in 1922 , a far-sighted decision by an executive of the eli lilly company ensured the dominance of his firm in commercial production. detailed biochemical work has shown that target cells carry an insulin receptor molecule on their surfaces , which reacts with insulin molecules in the surrounding body fluids. in both cases it seems that the problem lay in the transmission of the activation signal across the target cell membrane , once insulin has bound to the surface receptor. the activation molecule is an enzyme called & bquo tyrosine kinase & equo and in both individuals this molecule was not functioning properly because they had inherited a faulty kinase gene.
