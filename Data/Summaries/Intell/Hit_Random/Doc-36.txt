as nicholas booth reports , britain is playing a prominent role in a complex satellite which could unveil the mysteries of the earth '_ s resources the euro-eyes of the world. for_once , the uk is in the good books of the european space agency ( esa ) for our support of the european remote sensing ( ers ) programme , which will use the most complex satellites it has ever attempted to build. & bquo it '_ s one of the most important projects we have for the 1990s , & equo says philip goldsmith , head of earth observation at the european space agency. though esa admits there have been electronic problems with one of the system '_ s processors , it '_ s hardly surprising. & bquo it '_ s the most complex instrument we '_ ve ever built , & equo says joe mccaughey , marconi '_ s project manager. & bquo ers as a whole is a quantum leap for europe. & equo the rutherford appleton laboratory in oxfordshire has provided the along-track scanning radiometer , an infrared instrument which will measure sea surface temperatures down to 0.3c. & bquo there are americans who '_ d give their eye teeth for this sort of data , & equo says one ers project scientist at the laboratory. but the emphasis for ers-1 is science , as the ers programme is esa '_ s contribution to woce , the world ocean circulation experiment , an important part of global climate research in the 1990s. ers , with its microwave sensors , will give us the best view we '_ ve ever had. & equo there are no exact figures for the rates at which ice melts and refreezes , mechanisms which have affected sea level changes. ers , with its microwave sensors , will give us the best view we '_ ve ever had. & equo there are no exact figures for the rates at which ice melts and refreezes , mechanisms which have affected sea level changes. ers , with its microwave sensors , will give us the best view we '_ ve ever had. & equo there are no exact figures for the rates at which ice melts and refreezes , mechanisms which have affected sea level changes.
