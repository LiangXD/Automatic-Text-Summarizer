in those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment. a seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs. in a letter, prosecutors told mr. antar's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized. in newark, u.s. attorney samuel a. alito said, i don't think there's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases. mr. alito said his office just responded to an attorney's question about whether we would go after attorney's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that right. the sec has alleged that mr. antar aimed to pump up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits. mr. antar, the sec said, made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.
