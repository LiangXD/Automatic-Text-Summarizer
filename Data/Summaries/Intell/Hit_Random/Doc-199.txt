hence, humanitarian law requires that in all circumstances a distinction be made between military targets and those not involved in the armed conflict. many countries are parties to them, but the united states has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which us troops are taking part. hence you can hardly speak of a targeting error when a red cross warehouse, although clearly recognizable by the large red cross painted on the roof, was shelled twice by us aircraft. in other case, too, it seems doubtful that the crucial distinction between military and civilian targets was made systematically. even if these attacks were directed against a clear military target, the large number of civilian casualties would still never be justifiable, because whoever plans a military attack must take all precautions to prevent such a tragedy. secretary rumsfeld's statements (on 20 november 2001) that the united states is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners, and that my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the northern alliance) also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the taliban and al-qa'ida fighters. out of well-understood self-interest, countries such as russia, china, and israel joined in the bush administration's anti-terrorism campaign, because it enabled them to compare their domestic situation with the us situation and ask for moral support for the fight they have been waging against terrorism for years.
