space station's railcar slightly off track cape canaveral - (ap) -- astronauts sent the international space station's new railcar rolling slowly down a short stretch of track monday, but it quickly hit a snag that interrupted the inaugural run of the first permanent railroad in orbit. the railcar will eventually be used during the next stages of the space station's construction. the track runs along a 44-foot girder that space shuttle atlantis' astronauts delivered and bolted to the orbiting outpost last week. space station astronaut carl walz sent another computer command from inside to get the railcar moving again. "i think what we're finding out as we go through this is how the mobile transporter works in zero-g," said ben sellari, a nasa manager. the railcar is needed to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm from one end of the outpost to the other as more girders are installed. atlantis' astronauts plan a fourth and final spacewalk today to finish installing the girder.
