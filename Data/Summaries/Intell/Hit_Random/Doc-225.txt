in europe, the council of environment ministers concluded a formal political agreement on 4 march on the decision to ratify the kyoto protocol before 1 june this year. with this major decision, the european union is opening the door to the entry into force of the kyoto protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in august 2002 in johannesburg. the european union played a dominant role in these negotiations and the community of states concluded, at the bonn and marrakech conferences of july and october last year, an agreement that sets out how to implement the kyoto protocol and provides for an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations that could possibly serve as a model for other agreements and that suggests a possible strengthening of international institutional structures in the environmental field. the average global temperature will increase by 5.8d c by 2100, sea levels will rise by up to 90 cm over the same period, and there will be an increasing number of hurricanes with ever more serious consequences, while man and nature will have to cope with a shift in climate and rainfall zones the like of which has never been seen before. the dominant role of the european climate protection policy has benefits for our economy. it should therefore be implemented as quickly as possible and extended beyond the initial period of 2008-2012. the door remains wide open for the united states to return to the kyoto process: the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection.
