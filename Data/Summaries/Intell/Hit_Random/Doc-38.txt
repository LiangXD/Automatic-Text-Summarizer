consider the specification of the average dromedary : a top speed of 650 kilometres in four days under saharan conditions , a regular luggage capacity of 200 kilograms and a maximum recorded burden of 865 kilograms. also fitted as standard : a handy fuel store in the hump and an attitude to water conservation which , if widely adopted , would halve the price of water shares overnight. underpinning all these accomplishments is the camel '_ s efficient use of metabolic fuel ? a skill put to good use by mohammed '_ s camel , which allegedly covered the distance between mecca and jerusalem in four bounds. the focus of their studies was a group of six half-tamed dromedaries , originally part of the feral camel population of central australia. as each beast ambled at its own pace along a farm track , the team collected its breath with the help of a gas-tight mask and a weather balloon. equally perceptively , napoleon bonaparte founded his own crack camel corps after studying the progress of a desert caravan. one candidate is the leg musculature , which may turn out to be constructed from slower , more efficient fibres than those employed elsewhere.
