however, it will be difficult for japan to provide support to the us, as it did when the us attacked afghanistan, if us forces launch military action against iraq. at a meeting of several officials held at the outset of the summit, the president first took up economic issues and then referred to his axis of evil remark. however, koizumi said, i take the remark as the indication of the president's strong resolve to fight terrorism. it is possible that if the us military attack iraq, japan, which has shown understanding of the axis of evil remark, will be asked to provide active support to the us as it did during us attacks on afghanistan. however, it will be difficult for the self-defense forces to provide logistic support to us forces attacking iraq under a special antiterrorism law aimed at eradicating terrorism, which was enacted after terrorist attacks in the us on 11 september. because of this, koizumi noted the need for the international community to cooperate in tackling iraqi issues and enthusiastically asked bush to not take the bold course of launching military action. because of this, koizumi noted the need for the international community to cooperate in tackling iraqi issues and enthusiastically asked bush to not take the bold course of launching military action.
