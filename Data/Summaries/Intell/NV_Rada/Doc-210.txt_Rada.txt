The report expressly points out that, "It is extremely easy for terrorists to find supporters in countries where human rights are not respected and where individual freedom is repressed."Since Israel suffers from terrorist attacks, the report says, it has been forced to take counter-terrorism measures, making its rights abuses understandable.Apart from criticizing the "axis of evil" countries for abusing human rights, it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti-terrorist alliance.If the US, which claims to be the world's policeman, is incapable of looking beyond US interests or of practicing the universal values of human rights, democracy and peace, then shouldn't the international community reconsider the role played by the UN, or learn from the way the European parliament works?To prove that human rights are important ammunition in the battle against terror, then, the US must attack terrorism to make human rights matter to these countries.Consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overshadowing concerns about human rights.After all, compromising between the interests of many different countries is much better than succumbing to the interests of a single country.Put simply, what we are seeing is the naked pursuit of US interests.
