Some of the participants took the line that this is an extremely useful for Russia, which has "hot air" (that is, it is 30 percent short of the permitted level of CO2 emissions), and the country can become the dominant seller in the market; consequently, it has a greater stake than anyone in the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.This approach is based on the fact that Russia's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990, and, according to forecasts, the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years.The Kyoto mechanism is costly, but its value lies in the fact that its implementation has been tied to the market mechanism, that is, life without change has been made uneconomical."That is why carrying out a project and reducing emissions in Russia is far cheaper than in most developed countries.The gist is that, according to the Kyoto terms, quotas can be sold, that is, if you have fewer emissions than your neighbor, then you have every reason to strike an advantageous deal.Facts According to estimates by the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Energy, Russia's total carbon-dioxide emissions in 2008-2012 will be 20 percent below the 1990 level.Russia's Obligations Under the Kyoto Protocol They are relatively mild for our country.On the agenda of tomorrow's meeting of the Russian government is the question of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol -- a highly important international document that is supposed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.Background The Ecological-Economic Meaning of the Kyoto Protocol This is the first international document that makes use of the market mechanism as an approach to solving global ecological problems.In Mr. Gudkov's view, everything is developing well, we can take our time, and we can do nothing at all, since global warming is a threat only to the southern countries.The Obvious is Incredible The speaker's ardor was cooled by the well-known Sergey Kapitsa, who is not inclined to give way to rapture over the advantages promised to Russia."The assessment by the Foreign Ministry official is brilliant," exclaimed Aleksandr Ginzburg, deputy director of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics.There is a Proposal to Take Shelter Under an Umbrella The first to raise the problem 40 years ago was the Soviet scientist Mikhail Budyko, who saw that the curve on a graph of the air temperature of the earth's surface stratum was inexorably moving toward the upper right-hand corner.The Obligations of Foreign Countries Under the Kyoto Protocol Developed countries and transitional economies must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 by at least 5 percent from the recognized baseline year of 1990.Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, doctor of economics, president of the International University of Ecology and Political Science All of Our Activities Are Ruining Nature There are several models today, and they answer the question of why the climate is changing with varying degrees of persuasiveness.There are no results to speak of yet, but it is important that this area of inquiry has appeared.Russia is third in the world in total emissions -- after the US and China.But the expert urged everyone to despair, "since control of global warming without Russia is impossible; the country is becoming the owner of the controlling block of shares."Models are flawed, including the greenhouse model, and the only thing that is beyond dispute is that warming is underway, and the contribution of human beings to this alarming condition is very large, possible at least 30 percent.That is, all of our actions are accompanied by a deterioration in the climate.Because, strange as it may seem, prolonged, stagnant cold spells are also a result of global warming when there is less ventilation of the atmosphere as a whole.Our institute, along with the Institute of Systems Analysis and the Russian Academy of Sciences Computer Center, has begun studying the role of climate change in individual regions of Russia in order to forecast economic development.Gangster species are appearing, such as the locust, which is moving toward the north, where it has never been before.This is indicated by a well drilled in the ice cap of Antarctica 30 years ago, which helps to comprehend what has happened to climate.In addition to the suggestion from the sixth continent, it is a good idea to recall the Great Flood, which has been depicted, apart from the Bible, in many of the world's mythologies: "What was it?Consequently, if our homeland's efforts boil down merely to dealing in "hot air," this will not provide an impetus to start up high technologies and will knock Russia out of the group of countries that are striving for rational development, above all out of the European Union.The problem is that the present stage of study of small climatic models has scientists studying the life of the models as the life of a real climatic system.Our country has something like a controlling block of shares, since without Russia and the US the Kyoto Protocol will die.Six degrees, the professor believes, is unlikely, since that kind of thing has not happened on the planet in the past 420,000 years.It was aimed at reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and assigns countries quotas on their emissions."This is the best thing I have read or heard about the Kyoto Protocol!"Ratsiborinskiy, clarifying his agency's position, recommends that the government move to ratify, since the view at Smolenskaya Square is that the impact of our national efforts will be greater if they are integrated into the efforts of the EU.For example, Prof. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan maintain that "we must not speak of warming, but of global climatic changes; warming is merely one aspect of these changes."It isn't even the only cause of the increase in the greenhouse effect."
