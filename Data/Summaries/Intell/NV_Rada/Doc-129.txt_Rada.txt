In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket.Japan is determined to become a major power in aerospace.Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development.They include a spy satellite, a data relay satellite to transfer data between satellites, an unmanned universe lab system, a test satellite for communications and broadcasting, an observation satellite for environmental protection, "Kibo" the Japanese experimental module of the space station and its supply system, and the H2A carrier rocket to launch all the spacecraft mentioned earlier.Japan also has a huge space power plant plan.It is supposed to be the next generation rocket that is both inexpensive and highly reliable.In the field of satellite communications, Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) spent $310 million to develop the ETS-8 (Engineering Test Satellite 8) satellite.In November 1999, a "multi-purpose" satellite was launched by H2 rocket No.Presently, Japan is implementing these plans in different stages.In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies.This program not only puts Japan in the lead in providing new mobile communication services in the Asia-Pacific region, but also allows Japan to test some new satellite communication techniques to be introduced worldwide.Between 1970 and the end of 1999, Japan launched a total of 66 satellites.
