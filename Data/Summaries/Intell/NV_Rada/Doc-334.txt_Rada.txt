At the same time, there was no let-up in his continuing battle with the governor of the Bank of Israel, who is supposed to be his partner in managing Israel's economy.But successful management of the economy - the second front - is essential so that the resources needed for defense needs can be made available without causing serious damage to the economy.So we still have a way to go before our economic crisis reaches Argentine proportions, but there is little doubt that unless drastic measures are taken, we are on the way.Sound management of the economy is an essential element in the conduct of the war against Palestinian violence and terrorism.Confidence in the local currency is an essential element of a sound economy.Finally, the ministry realized the budget it had prepared would have to be drastically revised and curtailed.It should be clear that the problem Israel is facing at this time has much more than just an economic dimension.The structure of the Israeli economy is basically sound, but on the other hand, Israel is at war, with a significant proportion of its resources devoted to defense.
