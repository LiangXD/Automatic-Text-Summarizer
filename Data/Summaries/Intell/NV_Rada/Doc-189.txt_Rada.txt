Asked whether signing the Kyoto Protocol will affect Jordan and US efforts to upgrade the Kingdom's environmental framework, Tbeishat said that signing the protocol will have a "positive" outcome on Jordan.The Kyoto Protocol was agreed upon by 160 countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Amman -- Jordan, bound by environmental clauses in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, is currently mulling over signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming even though Washington turned down the protocol six months ago.In 1992, Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention that compels nations to curb global warming, which is blamed on gases produced by factories and cars that burn fuel.Certain steps have to be taken with regard to this objective -- including signing the Kyoto deal, he said.
