There are so many bacteria everywhere that picking out a GEM is a_bit like looking for a candle amongst Blackpool '_ s illumination .But the snag is that first you have to be able to recover the GEMs to culture them to do the catechol yellowing test .To develop a recovery method , Morgan , Saunders and Pickup used a Gem called Pseudomonas putida mt-2 , a modified common soil bacterium which may have wide applications for destroying toxic substances .Once you have the GEMs on the polystyrene spheres they can be washed off and cultured for testing with catechol or other techniques .There are concerns that , once released , GEMs might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria .A second problem is that many bacteria living & bquo ; in the wild & equo ; are not always easy to culture in the laboratory .Suspended in water , only the GEM for which the antibodies were specific will attach to the beads .So mt-2 '_ s purified pili and flagellae were injected into animals so that they rapidly produced antibodies specific to them .This GEM ?is essential because_of the risks involved in letting GEMs out_of the laboratory .are almost certainly the lost GEMs .The beads plus GEM are recovered with a magnet .Engineering a time delayed & bquo ; lethal gene & equo ; into a GEM to give it a finite life ?So_far , none are known to have been released in the UK .The researchers have devised a suite of methods based on detecting a marker gene engineered into the GEM .could suddenly produce a GEM with some nasty trick up its sleeve .According_to the researchers , highly specific antibodies have ensured that the technique is a success .is understandable .by making a GEM both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ?But losing GEMs could have much farther reaching implications .LOSING your favourite gems may be a personal disaster .It also establishesa system for the review and clearance of products containing genetically modified organisms so that conditions can be established for their marketing . & equo ; Reliable detection is an essential part of the precautions .The gene is very uncommon in nature so any intense yellow colonies of bacteria isolated from the wild ?The enzyme can be tested for chemically , even in dilute water samples or by using other more complex , state of the art , tricks like DNA amplification .Using catechol is relatively simple and cheap .is one way .Their method has been designed for recovering a GEM from water ?GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital .
