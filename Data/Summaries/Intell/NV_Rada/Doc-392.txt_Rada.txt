Officials bristle at US human rights report Response is being prepared Khalil Fleihan Daily Star correspondent Local authorities have expressed dissatisfaction - but not surprise - with regard to excerpts about Lebanon in the US State Department's annual report on human rights, a copy of which has been delivered to the Foreign Ministry.The report's reference to intelligence agents' monitoring the activities of opposition politicians and tapping the phones of certain government leaders "is a serious matter and harms Lebanon's image as a democratic country," the source added.The report was seen as discrediting Lebanon by portraying the country as being undemocratic or uncivilized and abusing human rights, the source added.The source said that the ministry would soon deliver copies of the report to the various ministries concerned, especially the Interior and Municipalities Ministry, prior to relaying its observations to the State Department in Washington.An official source who described the reaction on Tuesday said the criticism was an annual event and emphasized that it was not directed at human rights in Lebanon only, but covered several other countries in as well.The source said the most serious point in the report was an observation that the judiciary was subjected to political pressure, but referring to it as being "independent in principle."
