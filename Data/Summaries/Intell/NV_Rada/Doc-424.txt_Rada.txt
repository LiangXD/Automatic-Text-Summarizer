Now, five chapters later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter, energy, and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf.The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent say, an early bacterium is somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world.A simple autonomous agent, say, a bacterium, is a Darwinian creature.On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like F = MA and Darwin' s "natural selection" and "fitness," that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world.I know that the moon is they tell me not made of green cheese.But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics.We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents.It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, "only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful," is itself not empirically verifiable.But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom "intentionality" and "purpose" are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties.And the stunning fact directly before us, every day, is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf.If the conversation we recent two-legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive, so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem, where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another.The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents.As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus, why not envision a complex chemistry, say, very complex carbohydrate-synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves, which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism.There is no autonomous agent, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations.While fully aware of Hume' s injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent' s perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent.What in the world is "know-how" ?Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn, long-legged, knowing how winter is thin, when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found.But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings, Dan' s happy phrasing, is relevant for E. coli, tigers, us, trees, and autonomous agents in general.Strange and interesting, is it not, that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise?Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view.For this to be true, it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose, say, the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient, be conscious.In this restricted sense, signs are causally correlated with that which is signified.Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological.I know that the earth circles the sun, that the earth is roughly spherical, that chairs are used to sit on.I cannot buy Shannon' s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent.Without invoking consciousness, not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject, it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems, even without evoking nerve cells.The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached, the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids, the binding of the charged transfer RNA' s anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet, the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm, tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is "translated."Indeed, as I have emphasized before, a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents, ways of making a living, and the search procedures, mutation, recombination, as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents."Equality before the law" is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium.I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful, an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle, now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work, then do extract work, propagating work and constraint construction, from their environment.Popperian creatures, in Dennett' s fine phrase, have "internal models" of their world and can "run the internal model" with the clutch disengaged, rather than running the model in real time in the real world.I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent.And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present?The incoming molecule is "yuck" or "yum."If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.Where is the place of value in a world of fact?I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words.But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how.The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody, hence, the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space.Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creature namely, at least humans.Daniel Dennett, in his fine book Darwin' s Dangerous Idea, advances a hierarchy of forms of "knowing," if I may use that term, that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means.
