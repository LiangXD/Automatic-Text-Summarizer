Before the United States attacked Afghanistan, it first explained the reasons to every nation of the world, and China using missiles to attack Taiwan is certainly not simple.Kawamura: One of the reasons that the United States has all along not provided Aegis destroyers to Taiwan is that in the past the United States considered Taiwan's armed forces to be the armed forces of the Nationalist Party, not the armed forces of the nation.Question: What is the significance for Taiwan of the United States and Japan jointly researching TMD theater missile defense system technology?Taiwan is also very important to the United States, especially Taiwan's strategic position.Question: Where is China's true threat to Taiwan Sato: China's threat to Taiwan is the use of the three methods of missiles, amphibious landing, and submarine blockades.The most likely method is to use missiles to threaten Taiwan psychologically.I reckon that the probability of war occurring between China and Taiwan is smaller than small.Taiwan has no need to announce independence, and there won't be any problem if only the name "Taiwan" is used.Question: What is your appraisal of Taiwan's navy?Kawamura: Frankly speaking, Taiwan's navy is worrisome.Taiwan announcing independence is not itself a problem, but because Taiwan announcing independence would bring unrest and a domino effect would occur with regard to Tibet and Xinjiang, this is China's greatest fear.It is not possible that the Republican Party will get along with China, Taiwan can again wait for a little while.The traffic on Taiwan's seas is extremely important to Japan.
