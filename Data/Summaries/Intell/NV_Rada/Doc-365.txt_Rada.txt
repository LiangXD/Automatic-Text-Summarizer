While defying international pressure to back down from his controversial land reforms, Mugabe has said he needs a new six- year mandate to complete the reforms.Mugabe Predicts Victory in Zimbabwe's Election Zimbabwe's incumbent President Robert Mugabe Saturday predicted victory in the country's two- horse presidential race, saying that he will accept the outcome of the election because he will have defeated Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).Looking tired but blithesome after more than a month of daily election campaigns throughout the southern African country, Mugabe cast his vote in a weekend presidential poll, in which he is facing a serious challenge from his main rival Tsvangirai.Under these reforms, the Zimbabwean government has taken over excess and idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of the country's arable land, to resettle landless peasants.In Mugabe's view, the March election is a new chapter in his long struggle against colonial rule, which he led from the early 1960s until the country's independence.The Zimbabwean veteran leader, who has been in power since the country gained independence from Britain in 1980, was accompanied to the polling station at a school in the poor suburb of Highfield in the capital Harare by family members, including two children.Tension has risen sharply in Zimbabwe in recent months, after long and sometimes violent election campaigns.
