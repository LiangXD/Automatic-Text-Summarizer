The DNA section -- the "input" -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer's "hardware".Let's say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a "B" DNA type appears in a DNA section is odd or even.The computer can also do other calculations, such as checking whether the "B" sequence appears at least once, or at most once, by inserting different types of software DNAs.The "computers" are biological molecules, using DNA for software and enzymes for hardware, and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second.Once the computer has dissected the entire input, it can determine whether the sequence appeared an even or odd number of times according to the last label -- the "output".Prof. Shapiro says the molecular computer is the first of its kind.Although computers with DNA input and output have been made before, they have always involved a laborious series of reactions, each requiring human supervision.Some scientists believe DNA-based computers could have an advantage over existing computers based on silicon chips.
