Argentine pension funds have enjoyed interest rates as high as 35 percent over recent months: No less than 45 percent of the national debt estimated at between $130 and $150 billion is held by the Argentines themselves.But neither dollarization nor the currency board provides a guarantee of low interest rates, as there will always be an "Argentine risk."More than ever in fact, as the financial crisis that is shaking Buenos Aires has a useful message for us: The choice of a currency can never be reduced to a simple act of political will.It is not enough to proclaim, even in the Constitution, that one peso is worth one dollar, for that to be really the case.This is why dollarization has generated such support among politicians: From former President Carlos Menem, today leader of the most influential Peronist faction, to new Finance Secretary Miguel Kiguel, a former banker, charged along with Domingo Cavallo with restoring order to public finances.Michael Mussa, chief economist with the IMF until last April, recognizes this: "If we had paid more attention to the growing budgetary deficit and national debt between 1996 and 1998, Argentina would have been in a much better position to absorb the impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian real."That leaves the most economically realistic solution, the one backed by the technical experts: Floating the currency, but it is also the most risky.But it would also be a very painful way of restoring credibility, "like when one loses one's virginity and the only solution is to enter a convent," as one monetary expert put it.The linking to the dollar, as a guarantee of stability, was meant to rid them of the hyperinflation running at 2000 percent a year they had experienced during the 1970s and 80s.Unless the peso is devalued before it disappears, that is technically possible but more delicate when it comes to credibility.The Europeans are enthusiastically holding in their hands "the euro, our currency" that for so long had been no more than a much-wielded slogan.
