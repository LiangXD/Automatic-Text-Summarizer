Dear Friends of Pleasant Run: The holiday season is the time of year when we're all busy buying gifts, baking goodies, decorating our homes and making arrangements to be with family and friends.Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a contribution to Pleasant Run to help the 1,500 children families we care for.Let our families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of memories of the holidays you will have.Many of the children have no homes; no memories of joy from past holidays.
