Mark Wallace NEW YORK 1996-08-20 Consumer Reports magazine slapped a "_ Not Acceptable _" label on two sport/utility vehicles Tuesday , saying the light trucks "_ have too great a tendency to roll over in certain situations . _" The magazine said the 1995 and 1996 models of the Isuzu Trooper , made by Isuzu Motors Ltd. , and the 1996 Acura SLX , also made by Isuzu but sold by Honda Motor Co. Ltd. , were a danger to consumers because they "_ tipped up high on two wheels _" in road tests ."_ We do_ n't think a vehicle that has these characteristics should do what it did when subjected to this not inconceivable situation , _" said Bob Knoll , director of testing for Consumer Reports' auto division , in a telephone interview A spokesman for Isuzu defended the vehicles .Consumer Reports also asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate the Trooper and SLX and called for more stringent government oversight of vehicles with narrow wheelbases ."_ If Consumer Reports comes out and says , '_ Do_ n't buy this product , _' the sales will go down , _" Garrity said .
