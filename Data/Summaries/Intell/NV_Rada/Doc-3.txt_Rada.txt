1996-08-20 Kansas and Arizona filed lawsuits against some of the biggest tobacco firms Tuesday , joining a growing list of states seeking to recover hundreds of millions of dollars for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses .Stovall said the Kansas lawsuit suit was the broadest to date because it sought to force tobacco firms to pay for programs aimed at educating children about the hazards of smoking .Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall called tobacco "_ the most lethal consumer product ever sold _" and said her state's lawsuit was warranted because_of the "_ enormous financial burden _" that the tobacco industry had shifted to Kansas taxpayers .In that case the jury said the Lucky Strikes he smoked were a defective product and that cigarette maker Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , a unit of Britain's B.A.T. Industries Plc , was negligent by failing to inform the public about the health risks of smoking .
