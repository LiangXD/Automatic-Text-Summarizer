What Japan is doing with respect to the issue of putting the "Kyoto Protocol" into force is tantamount to an act of betrayal against mankind in the effort to protect human lives, health, and the earth's atmosphere.The session of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change held this time was to reach on an actual agreement regarding regulatory problems that have to be solved to put the "Kyoto Protocol" adopted in 1997 into force, so that the world may reduce the greenhouse effect and ecological damage, which are becoming more serious with each passing day, protect human lives and health, and provide favorable conditions for the promotion of human civilization.Since Japan has no spirit of independence and has always acted on US directions, Japan had continued to put off Diet ratification of the protocol and took such an attitude at the UN session held this time, under the plausible pretext that it would be meaningless to put the "Kyoto Protocol" into force, if the United States were excluded.It is a well-known fact that the "Kyoto Protocol" was adopted at the Fifth Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Japan in 1997.In discussing the draft regulations to put the "Kyoto Protocol" into force, Japan openly took issue with the draft regulations only because the contents of the regulations were not in its favor.Nonetheless, Japan, changing its stand this time, opposed the draft regulations to put the "Kyoto Protocol" into force and even called for liquidation of the draft.Accordingly, Japan would never readily agree on putting the "Kyoto Protocol" into force.According to the "Kyoto Protocol," by 2008 - 2012 Japan is supposed to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by six percent from the 1990 level.The United States, which has to do the most to implement the "Kyoto Protocol," has come out opposing the draft regulations.In the course of calculating the gains and losses of the "Kyoto Protocol" and trying to figure out what it should do, Japan found a good excuse.
