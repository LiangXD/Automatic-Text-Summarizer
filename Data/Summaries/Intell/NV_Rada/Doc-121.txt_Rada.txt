During this meeting, she has scheduled a meeting with peaceful antiglobalists, "but there is little I can do," she said in an interview."Therefore, it is a positive development that all 'summits' will be held in Brussels as of 2003," Neyts said.There is an immense gulf between the hype surrounding a summit and its result, which is often worded in illegible conclusions.That is not what it is all about."Neyts is a resolute defender of world trade and the World Trade Organization (WTO).Moreover, the WTO is a young and small organization, and not a cold monster as some people are depicting it.""This is no blind violence but rather targeted violence," Annemie Neyts said referring to the antiglobalist movement that set Gothenburg and Genoa, among other cities, ablaze.The WTO is accused of fostering trade anarchy.International cooperation is slow and does not function optimally, but the alternatives are worse.""There is not one developing country that wants to link social regulations to WTO regulations.Neyts understands that developing countries may feel uneasy about the kind of trade negotiations that are conducted at WTO level."Trade alone will not save the world," Neyts said, "but in as far as it refers to the free exchange of products and movement of persons, it constitutes an important factor for economic development.""And this is not only a feeling.This is even worse in the case of G-8 meetings.Neyts is convinced that gaining access to development is a much more complex phenomenon than is generally accepted."Unfortunately, Renault's Vilvoorde plant did effectively close down, "but this is a question of overcapacity in the automobile industry."
