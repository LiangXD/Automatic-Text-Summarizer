But few expect the government's plan for reviving the country's moribund economy to elicit much support abroad.Although he's so far successfully rallied the country's political class behind him, Duhalde, a former vice president to Menem and two-time governor of Buenos Aires province, has been dogged by allegations of corruption throughout his career.But at a time when the country is desperate for investment and international aid to prevent an economic crisis from exploding further, it is unclear how far Duhalde could actually turn back the clock even if he wanted to."He must think he can defy gravity, because he's pursuing the same crash course that Argentines and the rest of Latin America rejected a decade ago," says Christopher Ecclestone, head of investment boutique Buenos Aires Trust.But some analysts are concerned that Duhalde will follow it up with a return to the protectionism and failed policies that dominated the country's economy for half of this past century, until ex-President Carlos Menem changed course last decade and ushered in an era of stability.The man whom some economists say is leading the step backward in time is the country's new president, Eduardo Duhalde, Argentina's fifth in two weeks.Even before its faltering economy produced an epic-sized default, and the country was thrust into its worst crisis since democracy was restored in 1983, Argentines were obsessed with their past triumphs.For starters, there's a wariness among economists that an expected 30 to 40 percent devaluation could spark a return to the chaotic days of the late 1980s, when 5,000-percent inflation was rampant.A weekend poll by Aresco consultancy showed 52 percent of Argentines "highly" in favor of Duhalde's stated economic plans and another 34 percent giving him "medium" approval - an indication of public confidence.After four years of crippling recession, Duhalde and others are questioning whether Argentina's decade-long pursuit of free market reforms is the right solution.To contain inflation and fill an expected $11 billion budget deficit this year, government officials say a rescue package of at least $15 billion is needed from the IMF and other lenders.
