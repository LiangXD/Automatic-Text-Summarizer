All the world's countries and peoples are affected by climate changes but it is the poor countries that are being hit the hardest."The government wants to point to a significant reduction of climate gate emissions before 2005 after Norway has ratified the Kyoto Protocol in the course of the year," Environmental Protection Minister Borge Brende has written.According to the United Nations' climate panel, in the next 10 to 20 years changes in the climate will be almost unaffected by what we do in the way of initiatives in the next few years to reduce emissions of climate gases.Regardless of what Norway and other countries manage to do in this respect, we must prepare ourselves for climate changes.A quota is a right to emit a certain quantity of climate gases during a certain period and this right can be sold on a market.There is consensus that a broad quota system with international quota exchange should be used to achieve our emission responsibilities during the first obligatory period, 2008-2012.For later periods, sharper reductions are necessary and there is also the need to get more countries to take on climate obligations.In addition to being effective, an early quota system would also give business and industry useful experience before the international quota system following the Kyoto Protocol comes into effect in 2008.I am pleased that there now seems to be broad political consensus that in Norway as well we should get under way with an early quota system.In the government's work to put the quota system into shape in Norway, we are now discussing a number of problems.Many countries, among them Denmark, Great Britain, and Sweden, are already under way developing early quota systems.Initiatives between now and 2008: The government wants to show demonstrable progress in the reduction of climate emissions by 2005.The climate changes will be different from region to region.Businesses that are obligated by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quotas they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions.Even if developing countries have contributed to these climate problems to just a slight degree, they will nevertheless bear the greatest burden.Norway and other industrialized countries, on the other hand, have fairly good prospects of grappling with climate changes because we have an economy to put necessary measures to work.Norway should be in the forefront of combating climate problems.In addition to producing climate benefits, such measures will contribute to development and reduced local pollution in poor countries.
