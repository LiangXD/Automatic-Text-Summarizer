Late Monday the 30-year Treasury bond was trading at 94-05/32 to yield 7.10 percent ."_ The Chicago ( purchasing managers report ) make us think we may see a 54 reading overall , but the interesting thing may be the supplier/deliveries ( component ) , _" said James Glassman , senior economist at Chase Securities Inc .Given that , the market likely would able to withstand a strong NAPM report , he said .The five-year was at 99-15/32 to yield 6.75 percent and the two-year was at 99-22/32 to yield 6.42 percent .Unless there_ 's some disaster about building inflation _" a strong NAPM could be shrugged off , he said .Glassman said the market also may remain stable due_to the lrage amount of news to be digested between now and the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) .Market reaction to NAPM may be somewhat tempered by the more-watched nonfarm payrolls report looming on Friday .The 10-year was at 95-11/32 to yield 6.91 percent .The Chicago report showed there may be somewhat of a bottleneck in that unit of the survey , which could be a leading indicator of inflation pressures , he said .We already know the ( manufacturing ) numbers are strong , the risk lies in softer numbers $-- that_ 's where we could see a rally , _" Ryding said .Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has said that he regards the NAPM as a leading rather_than lagging indicator of economic growth , thus attaching much importance to the figure .Ryding said the market also had probably priced in at_least two more tightening moves over the next four to five months by the Fed .With strong demand and low inventories it would be logical to expect a rebound in the manufacturing sector , Glassman said .
