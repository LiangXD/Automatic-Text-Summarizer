Analysis of cells from these rats showed that drug action had interfered with the expression of genes for some of the proteins designed to move sugar into muscle and fat cells , exactly the target tissues which must be stimulated by insulin if they are to take up excess sugar .Either no insulin is produced ( Type 1 diabetes ) or the muscle , liver and fat cells fail to respond to insulin ( Type 2 ) .Most diabetes is the Type 2 form , in which the patient still generates insulin , but the body '_ s target cells fail to respond to it .Working out the whole story will be a long , difficult process of unravelling the pathways of insulin action in cells .Detailed biochemical work has shown that target cells carry an insulin receptor molecule on their surfaces , which reacts with insulin molecules in the surrounding body fluids .In both cases it seems that the problem lay in the transmission of the activation signal across the target cell membrane , once insulin has bound to the surface receptor .Diabetics may develop errors at any stage in this process , making their cells resistant to insulin stimulation .Normal individuals maintain the concentration of blood sugar at a constant level by their own insulin , which causes cells in muscle , liver and fatty tissue ?There is alarm at the subtle changes in reaction to the new insulin , which seems to give less warning of the danger of erratic sugar control .Therapeutically , this resistance can often be overcome by insulin injections .By contrast , genetically-engineered & bquo ; human & equo ; insulin is flashy stuff , a rapid application of advanced molecular genetics to modify a therapeutic product .Slow progress in the war on diabetes : Nicholas Russell says investigative research may beat flashy technology By NICHOLAS RUSSELL ONE IN 50 Britons suffers from sugar diabetes and , despite 100 years of scientific study , we still do not know how it is caused .The diabetic is unable to regulate sugar in this way .Two systems for engineering a & bquo ; human & equo ; insulin were developed and most patients have been switched to these engineered products .The activation molecule is an enzyme called & bquo ; tyrosine kinase & equo ; and in both individuals this molecule was not functioning properly because they had inherited a faulty kinase gene .
