Now O'Keefe's is to fix the space station."But the agency's credibility has come under fire in manned spaceflight - especially the International Space Station, now completing its first year of full-time crews.And this month, a task force on the project's budget concluded that NASA's cost estimate for finishing the "core" station between 2002 and 2008 "is not credible."O'Keefe's appointment "is a clear message from the administration: NASA has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we'd like to see NASA do," says Patricia Dasch of the National Space Society."O'Keefe is not known as a space enthusiast," says Keith Cowing, a former NASA scientist and editor of NASAWatch.com.The next mission for NASA could be to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program.Goldin's was to cut NASA's budget.Where Mr. Goldin was a product of the US aerospace industry, Mr. O'Keefe has served as chief financial officer for the Pentagon, Navy secretary, and business-school professor.Early on, the Bush administration planned to scale back US involvement to a "core" station with a crew of three instead of six.
