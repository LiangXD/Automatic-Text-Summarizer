As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, "Have you considered being a teacher assistant?"He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too.Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, "Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college."My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school.It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years.So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down.Naturally, I start crying, and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me, either my stomach, or that I had a headache, or something was wrong with my leg.So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family.But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money."Um, I remember once, when I was working in a mill, and I was spinning yarn, and I was saying to myself, and, I was praying actually, and I said, "God, one day I want to work in the school system.I don't, just so I can work in the school I'll be happy.So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.I really don't, I don't remember why that school was ever closed but it was.As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.Yeah, and at the time, I was also working in the classroom.After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school.I didn't particularly want to come here and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really, really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park.I guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence.
