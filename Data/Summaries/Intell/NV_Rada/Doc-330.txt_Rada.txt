No opinion polls have been taken, but talk radio, a popular medium that politicians use as a barometer of national opinion, is running slightly against him, according to the media monitoring agency Rehame Australia.Mr. Williams says "neither the US nor Australia is in a position to begin a prosecution against Hicks," acknowledging that he may not have committed any offenses under Australian law."The Americans seem to have retreated from an earlier position of the death penalty for foreigners, but we are still worried about the extent to which this guy's legal rights are being subjugated to the Australian government's shuttle diplomacy with the US."Not only has Australia's opposition Labor Party called for Hicks, currently held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to be returned home, but a Supreme Court justice has described Hicks as "a casualty" of his own government's attempt to maintain favor in Washington."You have to be realistic about the nature of the potential threat that the prisoners who have been transferred to Cuba represent," says Attorney General, Darryl Williams."The Australian government is, frankly, pathetic in that, for the argument of convenience, we are letting this man be held in conditions that clearly violate established conventions on the treatment of prisoners."The US government classifies the men as "illegal combatants," not prisoners of war, and therefore they don't have the rights laid out in the Geneva Convention."You will have people saying why are different standards being applied, on the basis of nationality, for what appears to be the same offenses.""Jack Straw was very strong about this in a way our government has not been," says Mr. Melham.Mr. Hicks is one of a handful of Westerners - including three British fighters - who fought with the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
