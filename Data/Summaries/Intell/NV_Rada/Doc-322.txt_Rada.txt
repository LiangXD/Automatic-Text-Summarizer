In short, because the estimates of the scale and timing of atmospheric warming are so uncertain, it is just not possible to assess the costs and benefits.Taylor may have offered a more prudent guess, but the fact is, accurate estimates of the costs of policies designed to reduce selected gas emissions are impossible.The fact is, Kyoto is without principles and no one has a clue what it means.Lorne Taylor, the Alberta Environment Minister, estimated the costs of Kyoto to the Canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year.Implementing Kyoto would cost a paltry $500-million, he said, and added more ominously that "the issue, technically, is that international relations fall within the purview of the federal government.Finally, vast uncertainty is built into computer models of climate change.A couple of weeks ago, the federal government distributed a colourful announcement in newspapers across the land proclaiming that "the Earth is getting warmer" and that implementing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, on the targeted reduction of so-called greenhouse gases, would fix things.The first, as the numbers tossed about by Taylor and Anderson indicate, is centred on costs of compliance.According to Jean Chretien, "the desire of the federal government is to sign it."Last spring the American National Academy of Science warned that because "there is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how the climate system varies naturally," any estimates of either the magnitude or the direction of future warming must be highly tentative.
