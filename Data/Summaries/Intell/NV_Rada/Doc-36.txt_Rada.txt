For_once , the UK is in the good books of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) for our support of the European Remote Sensing ( ERS ) programme , which will use the most complex satellites it has ever attempted to build . & bquo ; It '_ s one of the most important projects we have for the 1990s , & equo ; says Philip Goldsmith , head of Earth observation at the European Space Agency .Though ESA admits there have been electronic problems with one of the system '_ s processors , it '_ s hardly surprising . & bquo ; It '_ s the most complex instrument we '_ ve ever built , & equo ; says Joe McCaughey , Marconi '_ s project manager . & bquo ; ERS as a whole is a quantum leap for Europe . & equo ; The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire has provided the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer , an infrared instrument which will measure sea surface temperatures down to 0.3C . & bquo ; There are Americans who '_ d give their eye teeth for this sort of data , & equo ; says one ERS project scientist at the laboratory .Whilst other space agencies have equally ambitious plans , they remain as blueprints , or , as one European scientist puts it , & bquo ; pie-in-the-sky-eyes-in-the-sky . & equo ; ERS-1 has five instruments which will scan the Earth at microwave wavelengths to monitor ocean , ice and land resources .But the emphasis for ERS-1 is science , as the ERS programme is ESA '_ s contribution to Woce , the World Ocean Circulation Experiment , an important part of global climate research in the 1990s .Ice coverage limits the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and ocean , effectively & bquo ; insulating & equo ; polar regions from sunlight during summertime . & bquo ; You '_ d be amazed how little we know about the polar regions , & equo ; says Dr Preben Goodmandsen of the Technical University of Denmark . & bquo ; During the wintertime , there '_ s no sunlight .& bquo ; The key to the ERS programme is continuity , & equo ; says Guy Duchossois of ESA headquarters .Perhaps more importantly , governmental space sources relate that Margaret Thatcher is behind ERS-2 . & bquo ; She knows about ERS-2 and is enthusiastic about it , & equo ; says one .The Active Microwave Instrument radar system , built by Marconi Space Systems , is significant because it can be used over land or ocean : it will return vital information about how the wind interacts with waves .Nearly 10 per_cent of the Earth '_ s surface is covered by ice , which remains as terra incognita to climatologists as it was to 17th-century explorers .How the wind affects the ocean and modifies the heat exchanged with the atmosphere is not well understood , but is of paramount importance to weather forecasters who can not wait for ERS-1 to begin operations .ERS-1 is expected to return the first quantitive data on these processes at the poles .It '_ s an area in which Europe has forged ahead and which , against all the odds , is actively supported by our very own government .ERS , with its microwave sensors , will give us the best view we '_ ve ever had . & equo ; There are no exact figures for the rates at which ice melts and refreezes , mechanisms which have affected sea level changes .As Nicholas Booth reports , Britain is playing a prominent role in a complex satellite which could unveil the mysteries of the Earth '_ s resources The Euro-eyes of the world .
