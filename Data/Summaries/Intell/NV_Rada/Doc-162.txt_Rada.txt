Irabini said he explained to them that Misuari was being held for rebellion, and not because "he was a Muslim, a member of the Bangsamoro people or an MNLF leader.""We should remain calm and let the law take its course," Iribani, designated government spokesperson for Misuari's case, said he told a group of Muslim leaders and MNLF commanders in a dialogue in Zamboanga City.Rasul said they could not understand why the government was so hard on Misuari when it was lenient with other leaders who revolted in the past.Didagen Dilangalen said the prosecution of Misuari for rebellion could force the government to revive the cases against other rebel leaders, particularly of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the National Democratic Front.COTABATO CITY - An alleged member of Nur Misuari's elite force said Saturday there is a plan to rescue their jailed leader.Iribani said he explained to the Muslim leaders that Misuari's personal demands, including access to the media, could not be granted because these were not within his rights as a detainee.But while admitting to the plot, Rasul said Misuari's followers were also appealing to the Macapagal administration to free their leader.Rasul told Radio Mindanao Network here that some 1,000 members of the Misuari force have been on standby and are prepared to spring their leader from detention in Sta.MacArthur Rasul, who claims to be a spokesperson of Misuari's Mutallah Force, said the group was just waiting for orders to mount the rescue operation.Local Government Assistant Secretary Abraham Iribani called on Saturday for sobriety among Muslim leaders and Moro National Liberation Front commanders amid alleged attempts by certain groups to start a religious war over Misuari's detention.Aside from the sensitive legal questions, Pimentel said there is a growing impression that Misuari could pose a security threat to the country."If Chairman Misuari would go against (the rescue), we cannot do otherwise (but follow) because he is our commander in chief," he said.
