State Department officials this week accused Mugabe's government of numerous human rights violations during the election campaign, an allegation vehemently denied by ZANU-PF officials.ZANU-PF officials have told election observers that they intend to increase the number of polling stations in rural areas believed to be their strongholds and reduce the number of stations in urban areas, where there is strong support for the opposition.Government officials last month charged Tsvangirai and two other officials of his party with high treason for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mugabe.Political analysts say the charges may have laid the groundwork for Mugabe to jail Tsvangirai as a last-ditch effort to stay in power should he lose the election."People have said being ruled by the MDC is being ruled by Ian Smith," Mutasa said, referring to the prime minister of white-ruled Rhodesia, as the country was known before gaining independence in 1980.Tsvangirai said at a news conference Thursday night that if he won the election, he would not prosecute Mugabe.Opposition officials say that 22 of their polling agents have been abducted in the past week, and a surge in violent attacks in swing districts could persuade enough opposition supporters to vote for ZANU-PF to ensure Mugabe's victory.That charge is based largely on a heavily edited videotape in which Tsvangirai refers to the "elimination" of Mugabe.Observers say that could produce long voting lines and discourage some Tsvangirai supporters from casting ballots."Clearly, Mugabe is doing everything he can to steal this election," said John Makumbe, a political science professor at the University of Zimbabwe.
