Diesel engine manufacturers have long maintained that these are harmless , but recently they have been found to contain polyaromatich hydrocarbons ( PAH ) , which can cause cancer when breathed deeply .Trucks , buses and most taxis use them , and 40 per_cent of vehicle fuel sold in the UK last year was diesel .By Richard Longworth DIESEL engines are the most fuel efficient vehicle power source available .Currently , diesel fuel sold in the EC contains 0.3 per_cent sulphur , except in West Germany where the level is 0.25 per_cent .There are also buses at_least 30 years_old still being run , so it is likely to be decades before the fleet is replaced .Some manufacturers such as MAN and DAF have solved the problem by fitting filters which clean themselves with a small furnace as the vehicle is in operation .It is small wonder that the truck and bus manufacturers based in areas hit worst by acid rain , Volvo and Scania in Sweden and MAN in Bavaria , are working hardest to cut pollutants .But diesel engines also have very dirty exhaust emissions .While not having the concentrations of poisonous gases found in petrol engine exhausts , they give out far more & bquo ; particulates & equo ; ( soot ) .These will be electronically controlled , a technical task far harder on a diesel engine than on its petrol counterpart .NOx be cut to 11.8g/Kw/hr , and particulates to 11.8 g/Kw/hr , That level will still be significantly higher than US levels , but much lower than vehicles currently being sold .Volvo on the other hand is testing buses fitted with filters like dustbins , which are cleaned at the end of a day .
