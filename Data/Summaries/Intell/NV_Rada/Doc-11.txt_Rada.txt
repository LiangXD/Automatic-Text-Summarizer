SAN FRANCISCO 1996-08-20 Levi Strauss & Co. said Tuesday it was launching a line of slacks meant to appeal to men who do_ n't like suits , in only the third major brand introduction in the company's 140-year history .The pants , to be aimed at men in their 30s and 40s who grew up wearing Levi's jeans and Dockers khakis , are meant to give a big boost to the San Francisco-based clothing company , though how well men accept the new line remains to be seen , industry analysts said .In a national telephone survey of men in their 30s and 40s , almost half of men who do not work in jeans or a uniform said their office dress code is somewhere between suits and cotton pants , according_to Levi Strauss .
