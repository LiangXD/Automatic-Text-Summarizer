South Africa's leader, Mbeki, who has been inclined toward "quiet diplomacy" with Zimbabwe, has now made himself heard.Africa's Grand Bargain All was not lost in Zimbabwe's rigged election last week.This grand bargain to uplift the world's poorest continent would have been in jeopardy if Thabo Mbeki, south Africa's president, and Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's president, had not agreed to suspend Zimbabwe from the 54-nation group of former British colonies known as the Commonwealth.Their courageous stand will help renew a promise by leading industrialized nations to provide more aid, trade, and investment only if Africa shows better governance and democracy.The grand pact, known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development, was initiated by the two leaders.
