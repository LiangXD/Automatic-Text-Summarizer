"Since there is no other Belgian astronaut at the ESA who is capable of replacing Frank De Winne for this mission if it suddenly proved impossible for him to carry it out, we are also expecting to take out 'travel insurance' for our 'cosmonaut,'" Yvan Ylieff also said.The latest, and also undoubtedly the most logical, is internal to the SSTC, the federal Scientific, Technical, and Cultural Services, which, in particular, manage the country's space budgets.The sum in question will come from the SSTC's space budgets and be deducted in several years (two or three).The highway to the stars is looking radiant for the Belgian "cosmonaut."So, if that should prove necessary, De Winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship.In Brussels on Wednesday [28 November], the French astronaut Claudie Haignere, who had just completed a flight in space together with the Russians that in every way was identical to the one scheduled for De Winne, could not find enough praise for our fellow citizen, with whom she trained for several months in Moscow.So on 4 November 2002, that is to say, in a little less than one year, the second Belgian to reach space will take off from the Baikonor cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on board a brand new Soyuz space ship: the TMA-1.In a few weeks the second Belgian to go up there will don a Russian cosmonaut's space suit.De Winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting.He is making appreciable efforts to meet the other foreign cosmonauts who are in training there and share his experiences.For 10 days, the second Belgian astronaut will get to the International Space Station [ISS] on board the brand new Russian Soyuz TMA-1 space ship.
