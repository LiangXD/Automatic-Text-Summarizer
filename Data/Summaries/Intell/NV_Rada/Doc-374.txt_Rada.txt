It is not clear why the United States has not officially designated the detainees as prisoners of war, especially since Mr. Rumsfeld said they are essentially being treated as such.The warden at Camp X-Ray, Col. Terry Carrico, said he was determined at all times to maintain what he called "positive control" over the prisoners.And yet, officials at Guantanamo have said that no interrogation has taken place on the base and that the prisoners do not have lawyers.Critics said the United States was using sensory deprivation and other psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners so that interrogations would be more fruitful."I am telling you what I believe in every inch of my body to be the truth, and I have spent a lot of time on secure video with the people down there," he told reporters, referring to the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where 158 prisoners from the war in Afghanistan are being jailed.Asked what benefit the United States gets by not classifying the captives as prisoners of war, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "I don't know enough of the legal technicalities to answer your question.Mr. Rumsfeld said one of the complicating factors was that the Geneva Conventions give protection to prisoners from countries but not from terrorist organizations, like Al Qaeda, to which some of the prisoners apparently belong.Amnesty International sought access to the prisoners in Guantanamo and said they should be allowed to have lawyers.The International Committee of the Red Cross, in a rare break with its code of not publicly criticizing detaining governments, said the United States might have violated Geneva Convention rules against making a spectacle of prisoners by distributing the pictures, which were published worldwide.Several governments joined the chorus, saying the prisoners should be granted prisoner of war status under the Geneva Convention.Officials have said the prisoners come from a range of countries, - Britain, Yemen, China, Saudi Arabia and Australia among them - and that has also complicated the legal picture.Mr. Rumsfeld said the Pentagon's clear priority with the prisoners was to extract information from them to prevent future attacks."Keeping prisoners incommunicado, sensory deprivation, the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them are all classic techniques employed to break the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation," the organization said.22 - Frustrated by an international outcry over the American treatment of prisoners in Cuba, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld defended the United States' conduct at length today and dismissed the criticism as breathless armchair hyperbole.
