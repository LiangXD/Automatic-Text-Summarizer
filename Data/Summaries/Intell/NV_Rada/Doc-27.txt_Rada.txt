Developing the diet has had great scientific spin-offs . & bquo ; It '_ s amazing that a multi-million pound industry was built on an animal nobody knew anything about , & equo ; Dr Jones says . & bquo ; We have 50 years of data on the chicken or the pig .& equo ; The end result is that Dr Jones takes on overseas researchers . & bquo ; That '_ s fine as far as I am concerned & equo ; he says . & bquo ; They do n't cost British industry or taxpayers a thing , but of_course they take all their expertise abroad .& bquo ; It '_ s exactly the same , essentially , as making nylon , & equo ; he says . & bquo ; To do that , you take a_lot_of identical molecules called amines and join them together to form a chain .Dr Eric Edwards of the Shellfish Association says : & bquo ; Customer reaction is that they are stylish and upmarket . & equo ; Demand in Europe and North America continues to rise by 4 per_cent a year $- despite the fact that natural sources are already overfished .A team led by Dr David Jones , of Bangor '_ s renowned School of Ocean Sciences , designed a revolutionary new feed , using a process called microencapsulation which puts a thin , digestible membrane around each tiny food particle .& bquo ; Whatever the Government '_ s idea is , I do n't think that '_ s it , somehow . & equo ;& bquo ; Once we had solved the thickness problem , it became a commercial possibility , & equo ; says Dr Jones , & bquo ; and Mars ?We '_ ve learnt an enormous amount because the microcapsule is such an ideal tool for simplifying and controlling food intake . & equo ; Dr Jones and his team are now extending their work to other species , and to the post-larval stage , which leads to the ultimate product ?which is lucky because amines are actually very toxic . & equo ; After their initial breakthrough , the team still had much to do before the process became commercially viable .& bquo ; Now if , instead_of having a single interface between the two liquids , you emulsify the two ( like oil and vinegar in French dressing ) the reaction occurs over the surface of each suspended droplet , creating a capsule . & equo ; Originally , the team mixed prawn nutrients with amines , thinking that they would be needed to form the capsule .& bquo ; Frippak support our work generously , & equo ; he says . & bquo ; But they are understandably reluctant to pay for research students , because they will probably go off and join the competition .Traditionally , prawn farmers have trapped these young adults ( or & bquo ; post-larvae & equo ; as they are called ) and put them into ponds .But it soon became obvious that the proteins of the nutrient contained the correct chemical groups , and that the food molecules themselves were polymerizing and creating the capsule membrane .& bquo ; We know how fast food moves through its gut , how much energy it takes to make one post-larval prawn from the day it hatches , and_so_on .A team of scientists from the distinctly untropical environment of the University College of North Wales in Bangor has solved some of these problems by designing food fit for a prawn to eat .So the problem was to create a feed which came in particles of the right size ( five millionths of a metre across ) , could be freeze-dried , would not foul the water , dissolve or feed the bugs .But while rising demand , high prices and fast growth provide the stimulus , the prawn '_ s life-cycle presents many problems for the would-be farmer .But Dr Jones '_ s involvement with industry has led him into difficulties ?From a modest 1,000 tonnes a year in the early 1970s , the world '_ s prawn farms are expected to produce 440,000 tonnes by 1990 .& bquo ; Haemoglobin , chicken egg and many other natural proteins are rich in the important chemical groups , and these cross-link without any problem at all .The project '_ s got alpha ratings , but the council saw the industrial involvement and said & bquo ; Go to industry ?In the past , hatcheries have had to rely on live feed , which is as unreliable and expensive to harvest from nature as it is to grow artificially .& bquo ; Through refining our feed , by leaving things out and seeing what happens , we have been able to define the dietary requirements of the prawn throughout its development .& bquo ; It '_ s a real Catch 22 situation .& bquo ; The commercial aspects are very good , of_course ?There are more than 1,500 hatcheries in Taiwan alone .The larvae undergo a complex cycle of 12 stages in almost as many days , making their way back inshore as they reach their adult form .However , throwing organic matter into water feeds the bacteria as_well_as the prawns , which are quite fussy about who shares their environment .
