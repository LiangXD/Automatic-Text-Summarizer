If “return on investment" (ROI) is why you bought a home, or why you’re remodeling one, you can stop reading now.5. Spend more time planning, and less money building I toured a client’s existing home before we began designing the new one. “Of course," she said as we peeked in on the kids’ rooms, “these bedrooms are way too small."6. Consider the simple elegance of the box form house Subtlety and restraint used to be virtues in home design.Make the toilet and a sink in the master bath accessible to the rest of the house, instead of building a separate half bath – it won’t be used much by you during the day, and rarely by guests at night.A compartmentalized bath puts two sinks in one room and the toilet and tub/shower in another – so three kids can use the bath at once and keep a little more harmony in the family home.Take excess windows from bedrooms and baths and use them to connect the inside of the house with the outside.We once remodeled a house on the coast of Lake Erie that had one window – one – facing the lake.4.
