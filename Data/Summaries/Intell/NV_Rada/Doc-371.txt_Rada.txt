"The committee has decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate effect," Mr. Howard said, reading the statement alone, apparently as a face-saving gesture to Mr. Mbeki, whose own election observers in Zimbabwe found the vote "legitimate."Mr. Mbeki and Mr. Obasanjo - both of whose countries have under past undemocratic regimes been excluded from the Commonwealth - are torn between solidarity with a fellow African leader who was a crusader against colonialism, and their commitment to democratic standards as part of African economic regeneration.In the 60's, white-ruled South Africa quit the Commonwealth rather than be suspended over apartheid; Nigeria was suspended in the 1990's during military rule because of the execution of the human rights activist Ken Saro Wiwa.The unusual step was meant to punish President Robert Mugabe for his stewardship of elections this month that were widely criticized outside Africa as rigged.The response to Mr. Mugabe's behavior was seen by many outsiders as a token of South Africa's and Nigeria's own commitment to democracy as a way of fostering economic renewal.The Commonwealth also supported moves to resolve the country's violent crisis over the seizure of white farmers' land, backing Mr. Mugabe in his commitment to redistribute territory among landless black Zimbabweans.The two African leaders, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, maintained a cryptic silence while Mr. Howard spoke, endorsing the decision by their presence at a news conference but avoiding embroilment in a debate over whether they now view Mr. Mugabe's presidency as illegitimate.Angry at Vote, Commonwealth Bars Zimbabwe LONDON, March 19 - Flanked by the presidents of South Africa and Nigeria, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia today announced a yearlong suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, a group of 54 nations, mostly former British colonies.
