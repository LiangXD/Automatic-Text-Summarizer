Nevertheless, Taiwan heightened its diplomatic campaign through what Wang said was "parliamentarian" or "private diplomacy" to win recognition from Beijing's allies.He said the number of Thai politicians visiting Taiwan, especially members of Parliament, was increasing at an "unusual" rate.China's minister in charge of Taiwan affairs says Beijing will not resort to force to defend Taiwan despite the changing situation on the island, which he described as "our renegade province".He said Beijing will maintain its pursuit of peaceful unification with Taiwan and welcomed the resumption of dialogue, bogged down since 1999.He said the decline in President Chen's popularity could be attributed to the drop in the number of people favouring independence."I believe less than 10 per cent of Taiwanese now favour independence," he said.Wang said Beijing raised no objections to the so-called stop-over tactic used by Taiwanese leaders as long as the visits do not generate political activities in the host country.
