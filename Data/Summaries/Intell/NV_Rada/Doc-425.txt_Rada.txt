While I did not attend the trial--I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good.Steve Ballmer, of course, is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft, but it still seems to be Bill's show over there.The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna Dear Joe, I know what you mean about being a journalist.Much of it, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some very good stories.That's ironic, since I think it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley.Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories.Now I am getting way too philosophical, but this is my final missive, so why not?
