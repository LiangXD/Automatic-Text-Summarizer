Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino, meanwhile, said Sunday that his country would not support an attack on Iraq without "proven proof" that Baghdad is supporting al Qaeda, and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein dispatched a delegation to meet with European Union leaders in Spain.Ivanov said there was no evidence Belarus has sold arms to nations under sanction such as Iraq, though it did do business with nations not under sanctions such as Tajikistan, Angola and "even Gulf states.""Well, we don't like some of your allies like Saudi Arabia or Gulf states who give finance to terrorism organizations," Ivanov said.Russia disagrees with 'axis' remark MUNICH, Germany -- Russia's defense minister said Sunday that his country disagrees with the U.S. view of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil."What the three states do share, it went on, is chilly relations with the United States.China's official Xinhua news agency also weighed in Sunday on Bush's choice of words, accusing the president of orchestrating public opinion in advance of possible strikes against the three countries in an expansion of the war against terrorism.Ivanov said the West uses a double standard in its definition of terrorism, asking why members of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network are terrorists, but not Chechen separatists fighting Russia.
