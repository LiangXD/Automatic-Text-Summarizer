It's been a week now since Jean Chretien's Cabinet shuffle and the dramatic departure of Brian Tobin -- seven days during which the print pundits have had time to ponder his actions."Even thugs deserve humane treatment," reads the headline of the Ottawa Citizen editorial.By Day Seven, however, Ms. Harris-Adler notes that though Mr. Tobin has finally mastered the diapering process, his "baby" who is 15 years old is "not amused."Still, before discussing the antics of Mr. Tobin and the elevation of Ottawa's John Manley to the status of golden boy, there is the controversial, and more pressing, matter of the plight of the al-Qaeda fighters imprisoned at a U.S. military base in Cuba.WHAT THEY SAID: No tears for Tobin, but some for al-Qaeda OTTAWA - The plight of prisoners and politicians has been weighing heavily on the minds of editorial writers and pundits in and around the nation's capital."No tears will be shed in this corner since Brian Tobin's departure represents his third consecutive betrayal of voters," Walter Robinson, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and a regular columnist in The Ottawa Sun wrote yesterday.Manley] has proven to be a sensible manager who Canadians can trust," says a Sun editorial, observing that he emerged from the Sept."We can't help but wonder if some politicians and civil rights advocates are overreacting when it comes to the treatment of captured al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters by the United States.No one, however, is giving a hearty thumbs up to Mr. Tobin.In the Citizen, columnist Rosa Harris-Adler wrote a devastatingly sarcastic piece, ridiculing Mr. Tobin's assertion that he was leaving for family reasons."For the U.S. military to treat the prisoners any differently might very well imperil American lives," reads the editorial.
