Many African leaders have supported Mugabe's re-election victory in Zimbabwe's crucial election, which they said was " transparent, credible, free and fair".This is our land, and we have no intention of owning a piece of land in Britain," said Mugabe.He said the program, under which the government was taking over idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of Zimbabwe's arable land, to resettle landless blacks, would form the centerpiece of his efforts to revive the economy.Diplomats here said a government of national unity was partly intended to allow Britain and the United States to save face over their insistence on the MDC' s victory in Zimbabwe's election.At the State House, where the ceremony was held, thousands of ZANU-PF supporters in clothing emblazoned with Mugabe's portrait, were singing and dancing to celebrate his victory, with a hope that Mugabe will finally deliver on his promises to give them the land currently owned by the country's white minority.Harare, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Despite Western pressure on him over his re-election victory, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was sworn in on Sunday as the country's head of state to serve another six-year term.In his inauguration speech shortly after he was sworn in as president, Mugabe vowed to continue with his government's controversial land reform program.Africa is for Africans," said Mugabe.However, Mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity, incorporating his closest rival in the poll, to ensure political and economic stability in Zimbabwe.The European Union (EU) and the US have joined the opposition in alleging the election was neither free nor fair and threatened more sanctions on Zimbabwe.Analysts said Mugabe received much of his votes from the rural areas, where voter turnout was considered much higher than in towns and cities."We want to make sure that blacks play a meaningful role in the economy, and we will do that through the land reforms," said Mugabe.In his campaign for re-election, the Zimbabwean leader repeatedly accused Britain and its Western allies of trying to re-assert neocolonial rule in Zimbabwe, and the region, by installing a compliant opposition party in power.There are areas where we must work together because we have a common destiny," said Mugabe.
