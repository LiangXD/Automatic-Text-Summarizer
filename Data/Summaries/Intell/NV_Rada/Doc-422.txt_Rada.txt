Although the islands saw little action, as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power.Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors, who were led by Philip II of Macedon.The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified cities, but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders.While Byzantine land was being divided, there was no one in control of the seas, so pirates raided towns on many of the islands.The Persian Wars As Athens rose in influence and power in the West, it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire.In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval, the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans (at around 1300 b.c. ), who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland.Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands, the next major power change brought influence from the West.The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism, and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp, cool summers.Later, in 454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age.Santorini (Thira), the next major island north, was heavily influenced by Crete, and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time.Cycladic Culture At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the Cyclades islands.The struggle bypassed most of the islands, although there was fierce fighting on Samos.The Aegean Islands, which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes, became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse.By the time of the Crusades, many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated.Several islands and Greek city-states agreed to work together, and created a treasury to fund their plans, which was held on the island of Delos.The preeminent islands of this era were Delos, a sacred island and center of religion ruled by Athens; Samos, ruled by the tyrant Polycrates; and Naxos, whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major building projects.The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean Islands, which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade.The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen, many of whom were Genoese or Venetian, such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos.The Turks lost a short war with Italy, and were forced to relinquish the Dodecanese islands to the Italians.An important early material, obsidian, was discovered on the island of Milos.In 1566, they wrested Chios from the Genoese, bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands, but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or more -- Tinos was the last to fall in 1715.The Persians were defeated, and Athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it.After the war, in 1949, the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation.The Ottoman Empire was weakening, however, and in 1821, the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time.The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state.Finally, Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor, which became part of the new Turkish state.
