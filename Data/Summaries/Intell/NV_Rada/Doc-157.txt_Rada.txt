If the European countries were honest in the withdrawal of their ambassadors from Iran, blaming Iran for violating human rights, then they should recall their ambassadors from the United States.After all the United States is not violating the rights of one human being, but many many human beings.It would therefore be appropriate for all Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the United States.By clarifying the Imam's edict the Islamic Republic of Iran made the people of the world understand that insulting the Prophet was in fact violating the rights of millions of people throughout the world.
