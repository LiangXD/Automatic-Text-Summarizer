HARARE, Zimbabwe: A defiant President Robert Mugabe said his party had lost ground to the opposition through complacency, but would win this weekend's presidential elections anyway, state radio reported on Tuesday.Opposition officials said the claim was part of a government smear campaign.State radio also reported Monday that three opposition lawmakers tried to bribe Zimbabwe's air force commander to help calm security forces if Mugabe were removed."The problems of human rights and good governance are mirrored in their countries," Biti said.The U.S. State Department released a human rights report on Zimbabwe Monday that accused the government of extrajudicial killings, undermining the independence of the judiciary and waging a "systematic campaign of violence targeting supporters and potential supporters of the opposition."The opposition accuses the government of using violence, intimidation and new security laws to cow its voters and to prevent it from effectively campaigning.Mugabe said the decision to defer the possible suspension until Commonwealth observers report back on the election was "a victory against Britain's attempts to introduce a new form of apartheid" to serve Western interests in developing countries.Foreign diplomats based in Harare said Monday police prevented them from finishing a meeting on Monday with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai."We are now wide awake," Mugabe said at a rally Monday.Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand demanded the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth to protest state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses against the opposition.
