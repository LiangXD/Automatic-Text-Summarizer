"I think it was a serious offer," he said of the overture, which some in Miami scorned as a publicity stunt.Nor is there any worry over the infrastructure, which was stretched to the limit in 1994 and 1995 when the base became an encampment 55,000-plus Haitian and Cuban boat people -- and the commander sent civilians stateside to make room for the 8,000 U.S. personnel who came to tend to the migrant project.But Buehn said the Cubans have not raised any formal objections to the base's latest mission.He arrived here in 2000, and is now presiding over a transformation of this suburban-style base that, until its latest assignment, was a backwater of 2,400 people -- 700 of them Navy and Marine members, the rest Jamaican and Filipino contract workers plus family members.Until a Marine general arrived two weeks ago to run the prison project, Buehn was the highest ranking officer here -- a cross between mayor, overseeing the schools, social clubs and 5K run on Martin Luther King Day, and Navy commander, in charge of this strategic air and sea refueling station.So much so, he said, that not a single family member or contractor has so far requested to leave here, the oldest U.S. base overseas, and the only one left in a communist country.But Buehn said the new mission has given residents -- both civilians and service members -- a sense of unity and purpose after the uncertainty of Sept.Were Washington to decide to maintain Guantanamo as an offshore terrorist detention center, Buehn said, he would propose building a maximum security facility on leeward side.Between the armored vehicles ferrying Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners to Camp X-Ray and the international observers whizzing past, it may be time to dust off the only traffic signal that ever operated on the 45-square-mile base, says Navy Capt."It is in our museum, we still have it," he said.Geographically the base is split by the bay, and united by a ferry service."When I came down here, Gitmo had been downsized quite a bit and we were just maintaining our mission of being a refueling port and an airfield.
