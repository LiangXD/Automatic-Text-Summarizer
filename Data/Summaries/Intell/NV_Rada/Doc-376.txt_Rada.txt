When Argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, Bush administration officials did not take a firm position, allowing the I.M.F. to make the call on withholding additional loans, people involved in the fund's deliberations said."If Argentina got its core economic policies right, it would have avoided this problem," said Charles Calomiris, a finance and economics professor at Columbia University who has been sounding the alarm about Argentina for months.But he said that he disagreed with the decision by the fund and the Bush administration to continue the aid program in August, when he said the situation in Argentina had likely deteriorated beyond repair.Moreover, it is difficult to place blame for Argentina's economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy was designed by Argentina itself, sometimes over the objections of the fund's economists.21 - The deadly riots in Argentina, the collapse of its government and another multibillion dollar bailout gone awry have raised fresh questions about the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund and the financial policies of the United States, the fund's leading shareholder.The French, who like the United States are significant fund shareholders, have called on the lending agency to step up its involvement to help Argentina recover.Even the harshest critics of the I.M.F. put most of the blame for Argentina's current plight on a succession of governments in Buenos Aires.At an August meeting at I.M.F. headquarters, fund officials told Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, that the country would be better off delaying debt payments.Latin American and European government leaders today joined protesters in Buenos Aires, Wall Street traders and financial experts in putting at least part of the blame for Argentina's problems on the lending agency and the Clinton and Bush administrations.These criticisms, even if contradictory, increase pressure on the I.M.F. and the Bush administration to articulate a clear policy toward financial rescue efforts, which often come under fire even when they are judged successful.Argentina, however, was determined to pay its debts in full and keep its fixed currency in place, fulfilling what it viewed as a promise to its citizens and creditors who had been told for years that pesos were as good as dollars.Some say the monetary fund showed callousness by failing to give new aid to Argentina early this month, as the country's economic program, designed with I.M.F. approval, was forcing painful austerity measures on its citizens.Peru's finance minister, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, complained today that the fund bungled its dealings with Argentina by adopting inconsistent policies that were at turns passive and inflexible.But many say the monetary fund should have called government officials to account sooner.Michael Mussa, the I.M.F.'s chief economist until last spring, said the fund was justified in providing aid to Argentina late last year."The fund is partly to blame for this because the fund did not sound the alarm in time and then took a very hard line when things were incredibly difficult," he told Peruvian radio.
