To help you see how much your contribution means, I'm sharing with you The words of people who have lived Goodwill's mission.Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs.Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support services that will help even more find jobs.Last year, Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their self-sufficiency.A robust economy helps by providing job opportunities, but to be honest, most of the people who aren't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest obstacles."Before I got to Goodwill, I was on a mission.My instructor played a role like no other instructor I've ever had I appreciate everything that Goodwill has done for me." -- Cornell Each year, we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles.
