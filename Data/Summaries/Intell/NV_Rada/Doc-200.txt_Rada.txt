Per Stig Moller: Give Them Rights Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller (Conservative People's Party) is urging the United States to guarantee the prisoners the status of prisoners of war and in consequence protection under the terms of the Geneva Convention."Of course the United States has a point when it says that it can be difficult to decide who are terrorists and who are prisoners of war.The Socialist People's Party is sending an "urgent call" to the government to deliver official criticism to the United States.I can imagine that the United States has had good reasons for transporting them to Cuba," foreign affairs spokesman Peter Skaarup (Danish People's Party) says.Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Liberal Party) has voiced his approval of the U.S. treatment of the 144 al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo military base on Cuba."The U.S. Government has announced that the United States will respect its international commitments," Fogh Rasmussen said at his weekly press conference on Tuesday [22 January].The Danish People's Party sees no reason to criticize the United States.As long as no Danes are involved, the Danish People's Party does not think that Denmark should interfere." Social Democratic Party: Raise Denmark's Voice The Social Democratic Party takes the view that the Danish Government should raise its voice against the United States.
