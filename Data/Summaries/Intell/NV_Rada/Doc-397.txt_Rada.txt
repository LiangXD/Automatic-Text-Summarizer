Britain's Prescott Pushes for Kyoto Pact Backing VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- The Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be ratified even without U.S. support, British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told an international conference on business and the environment on Friday.Prescott, Britain's front man in pushing the accord, said the United States until recently was critical of the science that led to the Kyoto pact but has now accepted it, and he remains optimistic that the goals of the United States and of other signatory nations would converge.Prescott said the British program aims to cut emissions by 20 percent, and the country is now half way to that goal.Canada is among the countries that have pledged to ratify the accord.Prescott came to Anderson's support on Friday, agreeing that financial figures quoted by Kyoto opponents in Canada about the potential damage to the Canadian economy were "pure fiction."Prescott said that while the U.S. decision to reject the Kyoto agreement is a cause for concern, pressure will be maintained on the Bush administration to go further with its current voluntary emission-reduction targets.
