Jameson points the way for children who need that extra hand and I hope you'll continue your support this year.You're last gift of $50.00 helped make it possible for us to provide guidance, encouragement and fun to nearly 400 Indianapolis area children.The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them.What has your support of our campers meant to them and what have they been able to accomplish because you care?
