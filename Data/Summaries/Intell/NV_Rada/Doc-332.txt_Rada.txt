Peronist to head Argentina at least till March elections BUENOS AIRES - Veteran Peronist Adolfo Rodriguez Saa was set to become the country's interim president yesterday, taking power after a devastating economic crisis toppled President Fernando de la Rua.Rodriguez Saa is reportedly considering easing banking restrictions imposed by De la Rua, limiting to $1,000 the amount of money Argentines can withdraw from their accounts.Taking on a job many in his own Peronist party spurned, Rodriguez Saa is expected to serve as president at least until new elections, tentatively scheduled for March 3.His appointment would restore Argentina's largest party, the Peronists, as the country's dominant political force after the most widespread social disturbances since the late 1980s, when a previous financial crisis rocked this South American country of 36 million."That was the message the people sent to De la Rua and all the other political leaders."Argentines wary of surging unemployment, rising poverty, salary cuts and tax hikes are deeply skeptical of more calls for belt-tightening, the centerpiece of policies advocated by De la Rua and his economy minister Domingo Cavallo.A populist who has ruled a western arid province for 18 years, Rodriguez Saa will have to deal with an economy on the brink of defaulting on its $132 billion public debt and struggling with more than 18 percent unemployment.
