While the moratorium on part of Argentina's $132-billion public debt, heralding the biggest default in history, had long been expected by markets that have dumped Argentine bonds this year, Rodriguez Saa's plans for a new currency caused alarm.U.S. President George W. Bush said yesterday he was worried about Argentina, but was confident the country would "stay together" until it chooses a new leader while offering help once things stabilized.But bickering politicians agreed the crisis was too serious to subject Argentina to the pressure of quick elections, which had been scheduled for March, and decided yesterday to choose an interim leader to rule until 2003, when De la Rua's mandate was to end.De la Rua's cowed Radical Party agreed, with senior party official Federico Storani saying it would be "madness" to hold elections now "because the interim government wouldn't have the power to apply measures to get us over this crisis."Argentina's biggest political force, the Peronists, who ruled from 1989-99, withdrew support from Rodriguez Saa, accusing him of being power-hungry, and convinced other parties to accept in his stead Peronist heavyweight Senator Eduardo Duhalde.Plunged into chaos by looting and deadly riots that forced Fernando de la Rua to resign as president a week ago, Argentina fell deeper into anarchy when interim leader Adolfo Rodriguez Saa quit on Sunday after losing his party's support.Ordinary Argentines have been pouring into the streets night after hot summer night, banging pots and pans demanding, and eventually receiving, the resignation of De la Rua, his unpopular economy minister and aides to Rodriguez Saa who were suspected of corruption.He had planned to alleviate the cash crunch by minting the "argentino" to circulate alongside pesos, which have been backed up and pegged one-to-one to U.S. dollars for a decade, providing monetary stability and zero inflation.Argentina is a very important part of our hemisphere," Bush said.
