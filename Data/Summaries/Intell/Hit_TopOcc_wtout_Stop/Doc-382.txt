us-japan climate talks end representatives from japan and the united states have finished two days of talks tuesday on climate change in tokyo. they discussed ways of co-operating in the science and technology fields to prevent global warming. the meeting was the first between the two countries since president george bush unveiled a new us plan calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets. at the start of the meeting, the us said it would promote research and development into climate change. japan says it still intends to ratify the kyoto protocol. president bush caused an international outcry when he rejected the 1997 kyoto protocol on climate change last year, saying it hindered us economic growth. from the newsroom of the bbc world service copyright @ bbc
