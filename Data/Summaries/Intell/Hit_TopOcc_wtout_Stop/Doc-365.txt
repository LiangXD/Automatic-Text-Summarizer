mugabe predicts victory in zimbabwe's election zimbabwe's incumbent president robert mugabe saturday predicted victory in the country's two- horse presidential race, saying that he will accept the outcome of the election because he will have defeated morgan tsvangirai of the opposition movement for democratic change (mdc). looking tired but blithesome after more than a month of daily election campaigns throughout the southern african country, mugabe cast his vote in a weekend presidential poll, in which he is facing a serious challenge from his main rival tsvangirai. the mdc party has accused mugabe of using violence and other electoral manipulation to rig the poll. while defying international pressure to back down from his controversial land reforms, mugabe has said he needs a new six- year mandate to complete the reforms. however, the program has drawn sharp international rebuke, particularly from former colonial power britain, but mugabe has vowed to press ahead with the reforms. in mugabe's view, the march election is a new chapter in his long struggle against colonial rule, which he led from the early 1960s until the country's independence. mugabe even talked about his desire to keep safeguarding zimbabwe's sovereignty and land in spirit when he dies, a dream which the veteran leader said forced him to sacrifice a bright teaching career in the 1950s to lead his compatriots out of colonial rule.
