belgian industry is advocating benchmark covenants because it is afraid that an absolute limit would weaken considerably its competitive position with respect to similar companies in regions where the kyoto protocol is not ratified. but benchmarking is not sufficient from the viewpoint of economic efficiency (realizing the kyoto restrictions on emissions at the lowest possible costs for the whole of society). a cost-efficient division of efforts implies that each sector must limit its emissions to the point at which the additional costs for one extra ton of reduction are the same in all sectors. as a result, the costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth. fourth is the contrast between the benchmark covenants' relative emissions standards and the belgian government's absolute restrictions on emissions within the framework of the kyoto protocol. since industry does not wish to let itself be pinned down on an absolute emissions ceiling, while the government feels itself committed to an absolute ceiling, industry is foisting the necessary efforts onto other sectors in society through the benchmark covenants. this european proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the flemish benchmark covenants.
