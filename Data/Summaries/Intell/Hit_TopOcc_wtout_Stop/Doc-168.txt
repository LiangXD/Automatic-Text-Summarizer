dr. ren guoyu, an expert meteorologist at the national climate center of china, pointed out that the kyoto protocol was only the first step to resolve global warming during his interview with xinhua news agency. according to dr. ren, humans released excessive amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere in the past century, particularly in the past 50 years. this excessive emission of greenhouse gases has caused the mean global temperature to rise by 0.4 to 0.8 degree c in the past 140 years. this disaster can only be averted if we all join in to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to stop global warming. in march, the new bush administration openly declared it would rescind its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol. to implement the kyoto protocol, according to dr. ren, usually a country would incur an economic loss equivalent to 1 percent of its gdp when it tries to lower greenhouse emissions 1 percent. as a reminder, dr. ren pointed out: the kyoto protocol is merely a gesture for mankind to stop global warming.
