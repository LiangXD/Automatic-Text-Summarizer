on the agenda of tomorrow's meeting of the russian government is the question of ratification of the kyoto protocol -- a highly important international document that is supposed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. some of the participants took the line that this is an extremely useful for russia, which has hot air (that is, it is 30 percent short of the permitted level of co2 emissions), and the country can become the dominant seller in the market consequently, it has a greater stake than anyone in the ratification of the kyoto protocol. facts according to estimates by the ministry of economic development and the ministry of energy, russia's total carbon-dioxide emissions in 2008-2012 will be 20 percent below the 1990 level. in russia, up to 98 percent of all emissions of the main greenhouse gas -- co2 -- come from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas). the obligations of foreign countries under the kyoto protocol developed countries and transitional economies must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 by at least 5 percent from the recognized baseline year of 1990. russia's obligations under the kyoto protocol they are relatively mild for our country. this approach is based on the fact that russia's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990, and, according to forecasts, the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years.
