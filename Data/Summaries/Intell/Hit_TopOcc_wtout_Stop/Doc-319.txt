after spending months in frigid afghanistan caves subsisting on allah knows what, the 158 detainees the united states is holding in tropical guantanamo bay must think they've died and gone to heaven. the detainees should look at the balmy camp x-ray -- replete with running water, three square meals a day and modern medical care -- as a sort of taliban version of club med. amnesty international issued a press release accusing the united states of keeping prisoners incommunicado, (using) sensory deprivation, the use of unnecessary restraint and the humiliation of people through tactics such as shaving them in an effort to 'break' the spirit of individuals ahead of interrogation. as for the unnecessary restraint, one detainee has announced that he wants to kill an american before he leaves cuba, and another detainee bit a guard, according to pentagon spokesman capt. then there's the reporter who asked secretary of defense donald rumsfeld if american taliban john walker will be treated the same as the detainees. then there's the status of the detainees. you could understand the outrage if the u.s. military were torturing or otherwise mistreating the detainees.
