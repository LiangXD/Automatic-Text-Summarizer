mugabe victory leaves west in tatters harare: western countries were left frustrated and impotent after robert mugabe formally declared that he had overwhelmingly won zimbabwe's presidential election. the extent to which mugabe outmanoeuvred the west was made clear when southern african countries issued a surprise statement declaring the conduct of the election free and fair. he said mugabe had won 1,685,212 votes against 1,258,401 for challenger morgan tsvangirai, leader of the movement for democratic change (mdc). we find ourselves unable to endorse the purported election of president robert mugabe as zimbabwe's president in this election. in the harare townships where people stood in line for two days to vote in the belief that they were consigning mugabe to history, angry residents looked to tsvangirai to confront the government. we need tsvangirai to tell mugabe he cannot steal this election, said noel gukuta, a youthful mdc voter. in the final results, mugabe made a net gain of votes compared with the 2000 parliamentary election in every province in the country.
