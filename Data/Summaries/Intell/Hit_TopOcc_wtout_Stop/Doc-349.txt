new man for a new nasa mission forget space shuttles, orbiting telescopes, and more robotic rovers on mars. the next mission for nasa could be to steer soaring space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to what many call a dysfunctional space program. where mr. goldin was a product of the us aerospace industry, mr. o'keefe has served as chief financial officer for the pentagon, navy secretary, and business-school professor. under goldin, unmanned craft found evidence of water on the moon, inaugurated a long-term program to explore mars, and opened the door to competition from the aerospace industry and universities to plan and execute missions. but the agency's credibility has come under fire in manned spaceflight - especially the international space station, now completing its first year of full-time crews. the project's costs, like those of the space-shuttle program before it, have ballooned far beyond original estimates - from an initial $17.4 billion to more than $30 billion. now o'keefe's is to fix the space station.
