courtaulds plc announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value. the british chemical and textile company's plan, which requires shareholder approval, would create a new, listed u.k. stock with a probable market capitalization between #300 million ($473 million) and #400 million, analysts said. courtaulds' spinoff reflects pressure on british industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders. courtaulds' restructuring is among the largest thus far in britain, though it is dwarfed by b.a.t industries plc's plans to spin off roughly #4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from anglo-french financier sir james goldsmith. some analysts have said courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined. courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including australian financier kerry packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year. courtaulds chairman and chief executive sir christopher hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff.
