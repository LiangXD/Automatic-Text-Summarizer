geneva, jan 18 (afp) -- a report by delegates from the international committee of the red cross (icrc), currently visiting prisoners from afghanistan held at a us base in cuba, will remain confidential, an icrc spokesman said on friday [18 january]. darcy christen also said that among the prisoners transferred to the us navy base at guantanamo bay, cuba, were three british citizens and possibly some french speakers. however, the geneva-based icrc did not know the number nor the nationality, he said following a comment on thursday that there could have been french nationals among them. icrc envoys are discussing with us officials whether to release the number of detainees and their nationalities, said christen. the four-member team, which includes a doctor, will inspect conditions and treatment of the increasing number of taliban and al-qa'ida prisoners arriving at the base from afghanistan. the number of detainees being held at the isolated us military outpost on cuba's southwestern coast rose on thursday to 110 after the arrival of another 30 prisoners from afghanistan. the icrc considers, however, that they are prisoners of war protected by the third geneva convention of 1949.
