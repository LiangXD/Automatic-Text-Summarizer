so she said, little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like i asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you. all my life i always wanted to be a teacher even from the time i started to school. uh, while i was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that i had an extra bone in my foot and she said, well now sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college. um, i remember once, when i was working in a mill, and i was spinning yarn, and i was saying to myself, and, i was praying actually, and i said, god, one day i want to work in the school system. i don't, just so i can work in the school i'll be happy. i've only worked at two, two schools. um, that, i really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because i was there i think the first year i went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and i don't think they used that gym no more than three years.
