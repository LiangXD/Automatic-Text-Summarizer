commander of base sees a world of change guantanamo bay naval base, cuba -- what a difference a terrorist detention center makes. between the armored vehicles ferrying taliban and al qaeda prisoners to camp x-ray and the international observers whizzing past, it may be time to dust off the only traffic signal that ever operated on the 45-square-mile base, says navy capt. until a marine general arrived two weeks ago to run the prison project, buehn was the highest ranking officer here -- a cross between mayor, overseeing the schools, social clubs and 5k run on martin luther king day, and navy commander, in charge of this strategic air and sea refueling station. he arrived here in 2000, and is now presiding over a transformation of this suburban-style base that, until its latest assignment, was a backwater of 2,400 people -- 700 of them navy and marine members, the rest jamaican and filipino contract workers plus family members. but buehn said the new mission has given residents -- both civilians and service members -- a sense of unity and purpose after the uncertainty of sept. nor is there any worry over the infrastructure, which was stretched to the limit in 1994 and 1995 when the base became an encampment 55,000-plus haitian and cuban boat people -- and the commander sent civilians stateside to make room for the 8,000 u.s. personnel who came to tend to the migrant project. but buehn said the cubans have not raised any formal objections to the base's latest mission.
