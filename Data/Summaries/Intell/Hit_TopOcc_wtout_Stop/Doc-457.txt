harare -- opposition leader morgan tsvangirai has accused zimbabwean president robert mugabe of deliberately withholding food from some areas of the drought-ravaged country as punishment for not voting the correct way in march's election. mr. tsvangirai, the 50-year-old leader of the movement for democratic change, alleged in an interview that a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution the ruling zanu-pf has waged against him and his supporters. because of restrictions on foreign reporters in zimbabwe, it was impossible to obtain direct government comment on mr. tsvangirai's allegations. he said beneficiaries of the program have included government ministers, mps, army and police officials -- even mr. mugabe's in-laws. the situation we see now is what i call the last supper -- it is zanu-pf's final feast, mr. tsvangirai said. the opposition leader commended canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against mr. mugabe's regime. mr. tsvangirai also touched on his own legal battle with the government: on may 31, he is to stand trial on a charge of treason, accused of plotting to have mr. mugabe assassinated.
