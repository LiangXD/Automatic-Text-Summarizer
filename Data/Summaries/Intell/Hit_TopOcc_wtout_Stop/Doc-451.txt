dear , a few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with goodwill's help. she tells me that the 3,666 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $49 million dollars. in addition to that, by helping them find jobs, goodwill reduced the state's public support tab by an estimated $4 million. goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities. after maureen's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant, we helped maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society. at goodwill she gained in self-confidence, in her vision of her future and in the job skills she needed to find and keep a good job. goodwill provides jobs at goodwill.
