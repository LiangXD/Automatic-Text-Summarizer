seeking an ethical watchdog for the genetic scientists by tom wilkie in a rare display of consensus last week , industry , consumers _' organisations and the environmental movement called for a national committee to examine the social and ethical implications of biotechnology and genetic engineering of plants and animals , tom wilkie writes. ann foster , the council '_ s food policy adviser , said : & bquo there should be the equivalent of a warnock committee to look at aspects of genetic manipulation other than simply matters of safety. & equo the committee of inquiry into human fertilisation and embryology was set up in july 1982 under the chairmanship of dame mary warnock to investigate in_vitro fertilisation and human genetic research. the suggestion was supported both by companies involved in biotechnology and by environmental groups. the ncc meeting provided an unprecedented forum for all sides ? representatives of consumer interests , environmental groups such as the green alliance , and commercial firms such as ici ? to come together to discuss the implications of the new biotechnology. as_if they were stuck in the 1950s , the civil servants could see no way in which consumer , environmentalist or the broader public interest could be represented. we are investing millions in these technologies and we want to know what are the rules of the game before we take the risk of bringing a product to the marketplace. & equo mr pike welcomed the idea of a general warnock-style committee on the ethical aspects of the technology. but he opposed any suggestion that representatives of the environmental movement might sit on the technical committees set up_to decide on the safety of any release of genetically manipulated organisms into the environment.
