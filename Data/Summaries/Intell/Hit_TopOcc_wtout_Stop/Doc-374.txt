22 - frustrated by an international outcry over the american treatment of prisoners in cuba, secretary of defense donald h. rumsfeld defended the united states' conduct at length today and dismissed the criticism as breathless armchair hyperbole. i am telling you what i believe in every inch of my body to be the truth, and i have spent a lot of time on secure video with the people down there, he told reporters, referring to the united states naval base at guantanamo bay, cuba, where 158 prisoners from the war in afghanistan are being jailed. critics said the united states was using sensory deprivation and other psychological control techniques to weaken the prisoners so that interrogations would be more fruitful. the international committee of the red cross, in a rare break with its code of not publicly criticizing detaining governments, said the united states might have violated geneva convention rules against making a spectacle of prisoners by distributing the pictures, which were published worldwide. it is not clear why the united states has not officially designated the detainees as prisoners of war, especially since mr. rumsfeld said they are essentially being treated as such. asked what benefit the united states gets by not classifying the captives as prisoners of war, mr. rumsfeld said, i don't know enough of the legal technicalities to answer your question. mr. rumsfeld said one of the complicating factors was that the geneva conventions give protection to prisoners from countries but not from terrorist organizations, like al qaeda, to which some of the prisoners apparently belong.
