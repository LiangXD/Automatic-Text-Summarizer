caracas (afp) -- the venezuelan military high command maintains its support for president hugo chavez despite calls from the opposition to take part in an indefinite general strike declared wednesday night [10 april], and despite the individual acts of insubordination of two generals on that same day, one of them in command of no troops. he was followed by division general rafael damiani, from the militarized national guard (gn), who condemned the fact that president chavez ordered troops to use force in putting down a demonstration in caracas in support of the striking managers of the state-owned pdvsa [venezuelan petroleum, inc.]. however, the high military commands supported the government during the emergency caused by the strike staged by the trade union and business association opposition, a strike that was extended indefinitely on wednesday night, according to carlos ortega, president of the venezuelan workers confederation (ctv), the largest labor confederation in the country. on tuesday, the inspector general of the armed forces, general lucas rincon, accompanied civil defense minister jose vicente rangel and energy minister alvaro silva calderon in a tour of the strategic oil facilities of the state-owned pdvsa, whose managers are completing their seventh day of the strike that paralyzed refining operations and shipments of fuel. speaking in his turn, army commander efrain vasquez and general francisco belisario landis, commanding officer of the gn, affirmed that their forces are participating in the armed forces' plans of alert and denied that there is any militarization of the facilities of the state-owned venezuelan petroleum (pdvsa). opponents of the president who assembled this wednesday in one of the offices of the state-owned venezuelan petroleum (pdvsa), joining the strike waged by its executives since thursday [4 april], are carrying signs appealing for support for the men in uniform. however, datanalisis analyst leon indicated that even though chavez still controls the military forces at the present time, this fact constitutes no permanent life insurance, since the current indefinite general strike called by the opposition ctv and the fedecamaras [venezuelan federation of associations and chambers of commerce and industry] leadership is only one battle in a war that he predicts will be a long one.
