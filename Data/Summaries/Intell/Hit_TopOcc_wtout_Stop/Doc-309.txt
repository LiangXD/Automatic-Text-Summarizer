what they said: no tears for tobin, but some for al-qaeda ottawa - the plight of prisoners and politicians has been weighing heavily on the minds of editorial writers and pundits in and around the nation's capital. it's been a week now since jean chretien's cabinet shuffle and the dramatic departure of brian tobin -- seven days during which the print pundits have had time to ponder his actions. still, before discussing the antics of mr. tobin and the elevation of ottawa's john manley to the status of golden boy, there is the controversial, and more pressing, matter of the plight of the al-qaeda fighters imprisoned at a u.s. military base in cuba. no one, however, is giving a hearty thumbs up to mr. tobin. no tears will be shed in this corner since brian tobin's departure represents his third consecutive betrayal of voters, walter robinson, federal director of the canadian taxpayers federation and a regular columnist in the ottawa sun wrote yesterday. in the citizen, columnist rosa harris-adler wrote a devastatingly sarcastic piece, ridiculing mr. tobin's assertion that he was leaving for family reasons. he says that mr. tobin walked on too many toes, and made too many enemies in ottawa.
