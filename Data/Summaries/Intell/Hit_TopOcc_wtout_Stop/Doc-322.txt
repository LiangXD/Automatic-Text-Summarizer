politics, not the environment, drives kyoto author: barry cooper and david bercuson the only winners in the increasingly heated debate over global warming are the boffins in ottawa. a couple of weeks ago, the federal government distributed a colourful announcement in newspapers across the land proclaiming that the earth is getting warmer and that implementing the 1997 kyoto protocol, on the targeted reduction of so-called greenhouse gases, would fix things. another sign the debate is intensifying emerged last week at a global warming conference in ottawa. lorne taylor, the alberta environment minister, estimated the costs of kyoto to the canadian economy to be somewhere between $25-billion and $40-billion a year. he was alluding to the great money laundering operation whereby the federal government transfers cash from productive provinces such as alberta and dispenses it in places such as quebec. at the same conference, taylor's federal counterpart, david anderson, announced that the alberta numbers were absurd. implementing kyoto would cost a paltry $500-million, he said, and added more ominously that the issue, technically, is that international relations fall within the purview of the federal government.
