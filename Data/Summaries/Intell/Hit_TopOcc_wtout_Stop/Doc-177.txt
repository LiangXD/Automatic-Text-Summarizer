bagram, afghanistan, dec 7 (afp) - in a foretaste of resistance to foreign peacekeepers by the northern alliance, an uneasy atmosphere reigns between us forces and their afghan allies at the bagram airbase north of kabul. once the main soviet airbase during moscow's 1979-89 invasion of afghanistan, bagram has now become the hub for flights into the country as kabul's own airport cannot be used because of unexploded us bombs. although northern alliance control the main entrance to the base, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of kabul, just inside the perimeter there is a checkpoint manned by heavily-armed us soldiers. a contingent of the us 10th mountain division has taken up base at bagram, joining some 150 british marines, to establish a humanitarian air corridor for international aid but also to ensure security at the crucial airbase. when it gets to the point that northern alliance troops start firing in the air just next to a car with reporters, you have to do something about it, said cordell. he said that northern alliance commanders were irritated by images of armed us soldiers on afghan soil, and so media access to the base had to be temporarily suspended. however northern alliance defence minister general mohammad qasim fahim said the same day that he had rebuffed a british offer to send troops to kabul in the coming days and insisted he wants a strictly limited un force.
