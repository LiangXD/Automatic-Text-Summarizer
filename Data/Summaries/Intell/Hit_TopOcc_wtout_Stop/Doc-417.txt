my name is bonnie rindner and i was born in san antonio, tx, and the story i'm going to tell is about my mother. um, i don't know if they were farmers or not, but i know they were land owners, um, many acres and, um, her grandmother was raised in wealth. um, she was raised in mo, and she married a man, this is my grandmother i'm talking about. there was no money to buy any presents at all, um, for the children, and my grandfather, who was killed when my mother was 16, this was, of course, way before that, um, he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was he, he told the children that there were no presents this christmas because they had given them all to santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves. um, i felt like that was a way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love. oh, i have lived in charlotte, um, for a year. um, i lived in charlotte for five years.
