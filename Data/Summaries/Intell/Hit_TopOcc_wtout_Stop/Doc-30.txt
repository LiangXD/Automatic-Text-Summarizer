normal individuals maintain the concentration of blood sugar at a constant level by their own insulin , which causes cells in muscle , liver and fatty tissue ? target cells ? to take up excess circulating sugar and store it. either no insulin is produced ( type 1 diabetes ) or the muscle , liver and fat cells fail to respond to insulin ( type 2 ). two systems for engineering a & bquo human & equo insulin were developed and most patients have been switched to these engineered products. most diabetes is the type 2 form , in which the patient still generates insulin , but the body '_ s target cells fail to respond to it. detailed biochemical work has shown that target cells carry an insulin receptor molecule on their surfaces , which reacts with insulin molecules in the surrounding body fluids. analysis of cells from these rats showed that drug action had interfered with the expression of genes for some of the proteins designed to move sugar into muscle and fat cells , exactly the target tissues which must be stimulated by insulin if they are to take up excess sugar. by contrast , genetically-engineered & bquo human & equo insulin is flashy stuff , a rapid application of advanced molecular genetics to modify a therapeutic product.
