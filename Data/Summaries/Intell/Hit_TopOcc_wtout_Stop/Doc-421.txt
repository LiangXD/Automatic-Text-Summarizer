biblical jerusalem in the bible, genesis 14:18 -- 20 records that abraham visited the city of "salem" in approximately 1800 b.c. and was blessed by the city' s ruler, melchzedik, who offered him bread and wine. when seleucid rulers outlawed judaism, jews led by judah maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b.c. and, against all odds, restored the primacy of jewish religious life in jerusalem. roman jerusalem after the initial years of roman administration and political infighting, rome installed herod (scion of a family from idumea, a jewish kingdom in the desert) as king of judea. christian and islamic jerusalem for 60 years jerusalem lay in ruins, until the roman emperor hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a roman town dedicated to jupiter. the planned new roman city, aelia capitolina, was built over the ruins of herodian jerusalem, and jews were barred from residing there for all time. jews were evacuated from the old city' s jewish quarter, and thousands of arab families fled their homes in west jerusalem. as a result of armistice agreements in 1949, jerusalem was divided: west jerusalem was to be under israeli control, and east jerusalem (including the old city, with its jewish, muslim, christian, and armenian quarters) came under jordanian authority.
