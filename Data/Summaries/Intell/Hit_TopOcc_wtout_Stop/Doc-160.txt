it will discuss the bills on euthanasia and palliative care that the senate approved in the autumn of 2001. ever since then, the senate's work has been subject to increasing criticisms, including from groups that support a possible law on euthanasia. the criticisms mainly focus on the applicability of the senate's bill, the lack of a palliative filter prior to committing euthanasia, the supervisory role of the assessment committee, which is likely to be understaffed, and the nonexistence of fixed penalties for unjustifiable cases of euthanasia. the chamber will treat the bill differently than the senate, which worked with a joint justice and public health committee. moreover, the chamber's justice committee seems to want to go it alone regarding the euthanasia debate. this committee is scheduled to start the debate on the senate's euthanasia bill today. vld floor leader hugo coveliers and party member maggie de block also have a bill on euthanasia.
