its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish china's image and exert political pressure on the chinese government, human rights experts said at a seminar held by the china society for study of human rights (csshr) on friday. the united states was slandering china again, said xirao-nima, a professor of tibetan history at the central university for nationalities. it has no right to issue such a false human rights report, experts said. it somewhat softens its tone in the china human rights report. some westerners who have been there have also seen the ever-improving human rights in the tibet autonomous region, he added. the italian senator's words are in sharp contrast to what was contained in the so-called china human rights report compiled by the united states, which blindly accuses china of restricting religious freedom in tibet. the us human rights report also accuses china of taking advantage of anti-terrorism campaigns to crackdown on ethnic group people living in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region.
