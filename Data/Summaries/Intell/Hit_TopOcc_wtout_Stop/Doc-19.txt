three well-taken goals and three valuable points but still room for improvement against a polish team which also came close to upsetting england at wembley and who give nothing away on their home turf. _ poland will be a difficult side to play against but if we go there and play with the same attitude that we showed tonight , then things should go well , _ said stefano eranio after the moldova match. in group one , croatia can go top if they beat pointless slovenia in split and leaders greece slip up against bosnia in sarajevo. but we are going to bosnia to win , _ coach costas polychroniou said. the bosnians , meanwhile , are bubbling with confidence about the prospect of playing in front of 40,000 at the kosevo olympic stadium. _ i think i_ 'll get a goal and we_ 'll win the match , _ said captain meho kodro. group four throws together the two leaders as scotland , 2-0 winners over estonia on saturday , look to consolidate their place at the top with a win over austria in glasgow. after a comfortable 4-0 win over san marino , the netherlands face a sterner test against turkey in ankara as they look to make it five out_of five in group seven. romania will stay top of group eight if they beat lithuania in vilnius although the republic of ireland can keep up the pressure with a good result from their trip to macedonia.
