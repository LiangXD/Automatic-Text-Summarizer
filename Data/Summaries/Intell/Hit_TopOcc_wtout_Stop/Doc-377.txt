still, mr. bush's reaction to the biggest international economic crisis so far in his presidency is a telling example of a new - and perhaps risky - approach to the kind of national economic bankruptcies that dominated washington's dealings with the world's emerging markets in the late 1990's. but mr. bush's aides have adopted a policy some call tough love, meant to reverse the expectation in capitals around the world that if you are big enough, or strategically important, washington will always find a way to prevent fiscal and political collapse. but the first time his approach was tested, when turkey ran into deep trouble last spring, mr. bush's national security aides warned that it was no time to abandon a well-located ally whose government seemed willing to take the medicine the international monetary fund prescribed. it is a message that mr. bush's aides said in interviews this week that they hoped would force officials of developing countries and foreign investors to work out their problems without relying as much on huge aid packages from the international monetary fund and from washington, which became commonplace after mexico. president bush never talked about specific steps he expected the argentine government to take, said one white house official familiar with mr. bush's periodic calls and letters to mr. de la r?d the series of his successors in recent weeks. already there is considerable doubt that argentina will now agree to the kind of hemispheric free-trade agreement that mr. bush himself, with mr. de la r? his side, said last year was a major goal of his administration. the critics of mr. bush's decision to pull the plug on aid argue that the i.m.f. and the bush administration were callous for abandoning an ally at a sensitive moment.
