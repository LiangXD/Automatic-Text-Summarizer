bush takes great leap forward in pledging u.s. help in defending taiwan in a closed-door meeting in florida last week, the bush administration took a great leap forward in its declared policy that taiwan remain separate from china so long as the people of taiwan wish, even if that requires u.s. military force. the host of the three-day u.s.-taiwan defense summit was frank carlucci, chairman of the u.s.-taiwan business council, onetime deputy director of central intelligence, national security adviser to president reagan, later secretary of defense and possibly the most secretive official in washington in many years. the centerpiece was a visit by taiwan's defense minister, tang yao-ming, the first since president carter switched u.s. diplomatic recognition from taiwan to china in 1979. the senior u.s. official at the gathering was deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz, who has written: it would be a strategic as well as a moral mistake for the united states to ever let china use force to have its way with taiwan. it said that if china attacked taiwan, the united states will respond appropriately in accordance with the taiwan relations act. the tra, adopted after carter broke relations with taiwan, commits the united states to provide defensive arms to taiwan and to view a threat from china with grave concern. whatever decision bush makes, a defense official said, the pacific command is ready to respond to any potential crisis, including the use of force against taiwan by china.
