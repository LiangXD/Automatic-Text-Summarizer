in the richest irony of the war on terrorism, the department of defense, which normally goes out of its way not to make news, caused an international outcry by releasing still shots of detainees being brought to camp x-ray. and while american prisoners in the hanoi hilton often spent years in solitary confinement and received no medical care (john mccain to this day can't comb his own hair), x-ray detainees get daily sick calls from all manner of doctors, from optometrists to podiatrists. while public affairs officers these days are going to great lengths to talk about how docile the prisoners are, detainees have been reported biting a guard, spitting, and threatening to kill americans. after leaving the snipers, i collar other grunts who say they believe the prisoners are more apt to act out whenever they see one of the regular visitors from the international committee of the red cross enter the camp. many organizations who haven't been to gitmo, like human rights watch, have been extremely critical of the prisoners' treatment, while the icrc has aired no complaints. while he remains as firm as ever that the detainees are illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, which would afford them more rights under the geneva convention, he nicely avoids plucking the only hair worth splitting--whether the captives' status is his call. still, the overseers of the prison are concerned that detainees aren't getting enough pita bread with their meals, and they're planning to make the food spicier, just the way the prisoners like it back home.
