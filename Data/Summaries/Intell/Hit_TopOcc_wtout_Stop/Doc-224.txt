presented thursday 14 february by president george w. bush, this alternative plan for slowing down global warming moves away from the binding measures of implementation of the kyoto protocol, recently approved by more than 170 countries in marrakech, but rejected in march 2001 by president bush, who deemed it harmful to the us economy and reproached it for imposing constraints on industrialized countries only. it advocates a voluntarist approach to the fight against global warming by directly linking the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction to us economic growth. according to the white house, this should make it possible to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emission generated by the us economy by 18% over the next 10 years, an objective described by the bush administration as comparable to that imposed by the kyoto protocol. for the moment mr. bush simply proposes to curb the increase in harmful gas emissions and is counting on the good will of us industrialists, who account for 36% of the greenhouse gas produced by industrialized countries (as opposed to 31.6% for europe). he asserted, in an allusion to the binding objectives of the kyoto protocol, that it would be unjust and counterproductive to condemn developing countries to weak or even nonexistant economic growth by insisting that they adopt unrealistic greenhouse gas reduction targets. president george w. bush considered, moreover, that it would be irresponsible not to ask india and china to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. the white house hastened to describe the bush plan as the most audacious program in american history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions, considering that it would be possible to save the administration up to $1 billion, compared to the costs that binding rules would lead to.
