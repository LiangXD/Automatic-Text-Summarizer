beijing: china played down sensitive differences with the united states over taiwan on thursday, with president jiang zemin holding his tongue over us commitments to arm the diplomatically-isolated island. jiang said bush had restated washington's long-standing commitment to beijing's one china policy, which states that taiwan and the mainland belong to a single country. the united states passed the taiwan relations act in the same year as it switched diplomatic relations from taipei to beijing in 1979, reaffirming its commitment to taiwan and pledging to maintain arms sales to the island. taiwan relieved chinese analysts who advise and comment on policy also played down tensions between china and the united states over taiwan -- which beijing always says is the most sensitive issue in their bilateral relationship. bush's statement will come as a relief to taiwan, which has been watching his two-day visit closely fearing washington may give something new away to china in return for beijing's support for the us-led war on terrorism, analysts said. bush stands firm washington angered beijing last year by offering taiwan the biggest arms package in a decade -- including submarines for the first time -- and saying washington would do whatever it takes to protect the island. china had demanded that washington end arms sales to taiwan and step back from explicit statements of support for the island, which beijing has threatened to attack if it declares independence or delays reunification talks indefinitely.
