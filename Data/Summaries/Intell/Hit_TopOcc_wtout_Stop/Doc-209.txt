beijing, april 11 (afp) - china on thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the united states and taiwan, demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to us weapons sales. the continual sale of arms by the united states or upgrading of relations with taiwan will only lead to tensions across the straits, foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said. zhang further expressed alarm over washington's announcement wednesday that defense department officials will soon visit taiwan to discuss the sale of eight diesel electric submarines. china has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the united states and taiwan, zhang said. zhang also bashed remarks made last month by us deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz at a meeting in florida, attended by visiting taiwanese defense minister tang yao-ming. the united states is committed to doing whatever it takes to help taiwan defend itself, said wolfowitz, echoing president george w. bush's remarks made when he first took office last year. zhang said: the remarks of the us official are a... violation of us commitments made (on taiwan) and interference in china internal affairs.
