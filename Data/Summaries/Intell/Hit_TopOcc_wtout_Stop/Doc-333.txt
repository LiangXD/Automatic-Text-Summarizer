new argentine president quits after a week march vote nixed buenos aires - argentina ended 2001 leaderless and penniless yesterday with its new interim president resigning a week into the job and the country fearing more bloodshed and the loss of savings frozen in the banks. plunged into chaos by looting and deadly riots that forced fernando de la rua to resign as president a week ago, argentina fell deeper into anarchy when interim leader adolfo rodriguez saa quit on sunday after losing his party's support. but bickering politicians agreed the crisis was too serious to subject argentina to the pressure of quick elections, which had been scheduled for march, and decided yesterday to choose an interim leader to rule until 2003, when de la rua's mandate was to end. argentina's biggest political force, the peronists, who ruled from 1989-99, withdrew support from rodriguez saa, accusing him of being power-hungry, and convinced other parties to accept in his stead peronist heavyweight senator eduardo duhalde. the country of 36 million people is living in fear of more shop looting and violence that killed 27 people before de la rua quit, of more riots like those that erupted on friday and of more misery as a four-year-old recession grinds on. already, latin america's third-largest economy has declared a moratorium on foreign debt payments - rodriguez saa's first act as leader - and commerce has halted since cash withdrawals were limited to $1,000 a month to stop a panic run on banks. while the moratorium on part of argentina's $132-billion public debt, heralding the biggest default in history, had long been expected by markets that have dumped argentine bonds this year, rodriguez saa's plans for a new currency caused alarm.
