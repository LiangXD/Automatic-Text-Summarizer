the annual report published by the national bureau for defending land and resisting colonization in cooperation with the international solidarity establishment for human rights said that the nuclei of 36 new settlements were established from march 2001 to the end of november 2001 in various parts of the west bank. he pointed to the allocations in the sharon government's budget for supporting and widening settlements and building new ones, despite the crisis and recession from which israel's economy suffers. he stressed the need to concentrate on resisting settlement activity, settlers and their militias, and abstaining from subjecting this file to any discussion as a condition for halting the intensified settlement activities and removing existing settlements. advocate faris abu-hasan pointed to the violation of international laws represented in settlement activity and settlement building, and to israel's continuing refusal to respond to international appeals and violation of relevant international laws. he said: there are two grave violations, the first concerns settlement building and the transfer of settlers to the palestinian territories on which tens of settlements have been built. he indicated that settlements have emerged as military bastions and bases for launching attacks against palestinians during the intifadah. he explained that palestinian population centers were used as human shields for the protection of settlements, and that about 90 percent of the bombardments to which palestinian population centers were subjected originated in settlements.
