sarajevo, jan 18 (onasa) -- the decision on extradition of six algerians to the united states is in accordance with the responsibility and authorities of the bih federation bodies and international obligations, the coordination team for anti-terrorism said in a statement on friday [18 january]. bosnian authorities have handed over to us custody six algerians detained in october on suspicion of involvement in terrorism but ordered released this week by a local court, the us embassy said on friday. washington insisted it would not have acted without credible evidence, but the transfer exposed it to more criticism from campaigners who have accused it of disregarding human rights in its declared war on terror. a bosnian government official said legal procedures had been respected in the case, but a senior un human rights officer in bosnia said they had been trampled over. not only had a court ordered their release on thursday but the state's top human rights body had instructed authorities to prevent four being taken out of the country by force. washington is already under fire from human rights groups for its treatment of prisoners captured in afghanistan and held at guantanamo bay. he said the government had not been aware of the ruling by bosnia's human rights chamber that measures should be taken to stop four of the suspects being taken out of the country.
