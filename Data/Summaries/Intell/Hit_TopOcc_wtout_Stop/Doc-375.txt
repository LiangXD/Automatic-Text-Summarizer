bush plan expected to slow, not halt, gas emission rise president bush is set to announce a plan today calling for voluntary measures to slow but not halt the growth in emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming, white house officials said last night. the one thing the climate policy would not do is require anything of anybody, sticking with the position mr. bush has held for more than a year on the climate issue: that firm limits on the so-called greenhouse gases would drag down the economy. on another emissions issue unrelated to climate, aides said mr. bush would call today for mandatory restrictions on three other kinds of pollutants from power plants: mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. one provision of the new climate plan would be to greatly expand a program encouraging businesses to monitor and report their emissions of greenhouse gases. the proposed plan on nongreenhouse emissions from power plants - mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides - would impose mandatory limits but would allow companies to exceed them by buying credits from others that reduce pollution below required levels. there would be no similar limits on power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. in the face of lobbying from coal companies and utilities, mr. bush abandoned a campaign pledge last march to control the four plant emissions together and has shown no signs of reconsidering that idea.
