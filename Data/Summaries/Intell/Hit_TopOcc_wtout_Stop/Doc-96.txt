fed chairman alan greenspan has said that he regards the napm as a leading rather_than lagging indicator of economic growth , thus attaching much importance to the figure. that may add to fear the fed will vote to tighten again at its may 20 meeting should the figure come in strong. _ the chicago ( purchasing managers report ) make us think we may see a 54 reading overall , but the interesting thing may be the supplier/deliveries ( component ) , _ said james glassman , senior economist at chase securities inc. glassman said the market also may remain stable due_to the lrage amount of news to be digested between now and the next meeting of the fed's policy-making federal open market committee ( fomc ). _ the market knows this ( manufacturing ) rebound is strong. economists polled by reuters are forecasting , on average , 182,000 new nonfarm jobs were created in march , compared to 339,000 in february. _ i would guess the market has already priced in a small increase in napm. we_ 're looking for a 54 , _ said john ryding , senior economist at bear stearns & co. ryding said the market also had probably priced in at_least two more tightening moves over the next four to five months by the fed. we already know the ( manufacturing ) numbers are strong , the risk lies in softer numbers $-- that_ 's where we could see a rally , _ ryding said. tuesday also will see the release of btm/schroders retail sales report at 0900 est/1400 gmt as_well_as leading economic indicators and construction spending at 1000 est/1500 gmt.
