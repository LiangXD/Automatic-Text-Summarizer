avaulta mesh: patients are not the women they once were washington, dc: avaulta mesh is but one player in a women's health issue that, to some in the legal profession, represent a particularly alarming portfolio that sees many patients no longer existing as the women they once were. lawsuits involving the bard avaulta mesh implant have been consolidated in federal court in the southern district of west virginia. while problems with the surgically implanted product—used to treat incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse (pop)—have been suspected and alleged for years, only recently did the fda acknowledge that bard mesh and its various cousins may not be the best treatment option related to the aforementioned issues. in the absence of an avaulta mesh recall, the fda announced in july that it is requiring all transvaginal (tvm) mesh manufacturers to devote the next three years to post-market testing. however, in practice, the indication for surgical mesh to treat incontinence and pop in women has been a bit of a crap shoot given the absence of intensive pre-market testing—testing not required under fda guidelines governing new products that are substantially similar to those already on the market. in practice, tvm mesh products—bard mesh among them—have presented a myriad of health issues for women. ironically, with some patients for whom the avaulta pelvic mesh was intended to resolve incontinence problems, symptoms of incontinence persisted.
