at a japan-us summit meeting on 18 february, prime minister junichiro koizumi expressed some understanding of us president george w. bush's remarks that iran, iraq, and the dprk (north korea) are an axis of evil. this left the impression that japan stands alone on this issue because european countries have been cool to bush's axis of evil rhetoric. however, it will be difficult for japan to provide support to the us, as it did when the us attacked afghanistan, if us forces launch military action against iraq. it is possible that if the us military attack iraq, japan, which has shown understanding of the axis of evil remark, will be asked to provide active support to the us as it did during us attacks on afghanistan. if japan does not give any support to possible us attacks on iraq despite its understanding of the axis of evil rhetoric, bush's expectations on the koizumi administration will certainly change to disappointment. although the japanese government has expressed understanding of bush's axis of evil remark, it does not hope to see the us taking military action. because of this, koizumi noted the need for the international community to cooperate in tackling iraqi issues and enthusiastically asked bush to not take the bold course of launching military action.
