israeli arab leaders yesterday pledged to fight a proposed 25%-30% cut in national insurance institute child benefits for those who have not served in the army or completed national service. the forum of arab council heads is to meet tomorrow to draw up an action campaign aimed at thwarting the plan, part of a package of recommendations put forward by the treasury for a nis 13 million cut in government spending. shawqi khatib, chairman of the monitoring committee of the israeli arab leadership, said arabs would be hardest hit if the government approves the cutbacks in child benefits. khatib, who also chairs the forum of arab council heads, said the leadership is diametrically opposed to any cutbacks, particularly when those affecting the lower socio-economic strata of society. zaydan said the proposed cut in child benefits would deal a body blow to all those already classed as being below the poverty line. i remember when the late prime minister yitzhaq rabin did away with the discrimination that had existed for years and equalized child benefits regardless of whether parents had served in the army or not, zaydan said. we applauded this move because it was not only just, but it made us begin to feel that we, as arabs, were an integral part of israeli society.
