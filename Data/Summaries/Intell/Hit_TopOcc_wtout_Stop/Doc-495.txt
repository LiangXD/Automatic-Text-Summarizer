the un international conference on financing for development opened in monterrey on 18 march (telam photo) monterrey, mexico--choked, hushed voices, some of them astounded, are not guessing correctly about the dilemma of the chicken or the egg into which the argentine crisis has become converted, almost grotesquely: will the international monetary fund (imf) endorse concrete aid to the country, apart from the presumable good intentions of its board members and technicians, without the approval of george w. bush? certainly not, was the comment made in a private dialogue with la nacion by a diplomatic source from the united states who, with a legion of colleagues, is attending the united nations conference on financing for development that opened yesterday in monterrey, mexico. more political than economic it is common knowledge, among most of the small groups, that the argentine crisis is more political than economic, and that, as one latin american diplomat accredited to the un remarked, the formula in question does not hold much mystery: a rapprochement with the united states is indispensable, because it is the only one that can extricate them from this. the source commented: argentine is in a position to be an alternative reference point for the united states, to the detriment of brazil which, in view of the internal and external vicissitudes facing fernando henrique cardoso, is, day by day, becoming somewhat weak. with 58 chief executives immersed in signing a document which, as la nacion was told by the argentine ambassador to the united nations, arnoldo listre, gives a clue to the direction in which we are heading: it shows a new organization in which the market economy is accepted as a fundamental factor for development and, unlike the cold war, is rid of the north-south confrontation. in the documents, argentina ranks in 59th place for its per capita income: $7,440, according to the world bank's report on development: a substantially devalued figure after the default and the end of the currency board arrangement. a source from the united nations observed ironically: if chile were iraq, and if president ricardo lagos were saddam hussein, argentina would have bush's full support.
