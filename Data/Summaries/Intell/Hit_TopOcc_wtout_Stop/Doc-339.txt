'axis of evil' charge raises questions washington -- president bush's declaration that countries such as iran, iraq and north korea represent an "axis of evil" that must be prevented from acquiring weapons of mass destruction touched off questions around the globe wednesday. the president told congress that iran, iraq and north korea pose "a grave and growing danger" because they seek weapons of mass destruction and have links with terrorist groups. iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan, responding to bush's "axis of evil" remark, said the u.s. government "is the source of evil" in the world. the rhetoric also caused shudders in u.s. allies south korea, where president kim dae-jung has rested his reputation on easing a half-century of confrontation with the heavily armed communist north, and japan, which is also within missile range of north korea. american intelligence has known for a decade or more of attempts by iran, iraq and north korea to develop nuclear weapons, poisons and germs. for iran, bush's condemnation marked a return to confrontation. as with iran, the bush administration has tried talk and threats with north korea.
