the european parliament, which convened yesterday in strasbourg, decided to advise the 15 member states of the european union to impose economic sanctions on israel and, specifically, to suspend association agreements with jerusalem. for some time, european politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with israel -- a move, which in light of close and extensive trade relations between eu member states and israel, could cause serious damage. european commission president romano prodi expressed similar sentiments: in his opinion, the eu should consider imposing an economic punishment on israel in protest against the operations of the israel defense forces in the territories. it takes more than a recommendation from the european parliament for this to happen the decision has to be taken by both the european commission and the eu's council of foreign ministers, on which all 15 foreign ministers sit, and has to be unanimous. the europeans know that repeated denunciations of israel, not to mention its punishment, will not lead to a solution of the conflict. israel will not change its positions on vital security issues, even if the european states eliminate customs breaks afforded to israeli exports. eu external affairs commissioner chris patten expressed this clearly tuesday when he said that canceling the association agreements between israel and the eu would do nothing to enhance jerusalem's readiness to listen to european representatives.
