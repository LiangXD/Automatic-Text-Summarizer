mbeki, obasanjo envoys in fresh bid to save mugabe staff reporter 3/28/02 1:22:20 am (gmt +2) african superpowers south africa and nigeria this week stepped up efforts to broker a comprise between zimbabwe's ruling zanu pf party and the opposition movement for democratic change (mdc) to ward off the crisis of illegitimacy facing controversially elected president robert mugabe's new administration. presidents thabo mbeki and olusegun obasanjo, sensing outright isolation of mugabe and the refusal by many zimbabweans and the west to recognise his win, have dispatched african national congress secretary-general kgalema motlanthe and prominent west african diplomat adebayo adedeji to try to hammer a compromise between zanu pf and the mdc. diplomatic sources say african leaders are frantically making efforts to bring the mdc on board through the formation of a coalition government in order to facilitate recognition of the zimbabwean government by the international community and unlock much-needed foreign aid that has been suspended. zanu pf however wants the mdc to accept the result of the presidential election and join it in a coalition government whose composition is not yet clear. the sources said the formation of a coalition government being pushed by mbeki and obasanjo was the most ideal way to stave off international isolation of zimbabwe but has been received with mixed feelings by the governing party. others say zanu pf only wants the mdc on board to facilitate international recognition and the financing of its economic recovery programme and land reforms. it is also believed that some hardliners in zanu pf want the current treason charges against tsvangirai to be used as a bargaining chip to arm-twist the mdc leader into a compromise with mugabe.
