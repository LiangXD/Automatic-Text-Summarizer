president hugo chavez has warned that certain sectors have once again taken up the idea of looking forceful way out in venezuela, either through a coup or an attack that would end his life. the president charged that attacks targeting his person have gone on for over 10 years, and that he has been accused, among other things, of ties with the guerrillas, of buying arms and trying to set up a communist regime in venezuela. he noted that as the year draws to a close, the indicators are positive for venezuela, then emphasized that the country has regained such internationally recognized posts as the presidency of the group of the 15 and the group of the 77. he said that venezuela was led away from that path because the same thing would have happened here. the chief of state also recalled that the previous governments viewed the colombian guerrillas as enemies of venezuela, which led to operations in colombian territory to attack the rebel groups. in his opinion, this was a serious error that resulted in victims and loss of venezuelan lives because we were meddling directly in an internal conflict in colombia. [quotation marks as published] we were meddling in an internal conflict of another country, which is a violation of international law and which in turn gave the guerrillas the right to attack our military units.
