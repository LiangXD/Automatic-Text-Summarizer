kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival general mills inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while general mills' share is about 27%. led by its oat-based cheerios line, general mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of kellogg. the new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and kellogg's largest construction project. until recently, kellogg had been telling its sales force and wall street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume. although he called current market conditions highly competitive, mr. lamothe, kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year. last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.
