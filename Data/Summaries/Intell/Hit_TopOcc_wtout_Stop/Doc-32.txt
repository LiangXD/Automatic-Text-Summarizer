by richard longworth diesel engines are the most fuel efficient vehicle power source available. diesel engine manufacturers have long maintained that these are harmless , but recently they have been found to contain polyaromatich hydrocarbons ( pah ) , which can cause cancer when breathed deeply. diesel engines also produce nitrous ocxides ( nox ) , which return from the skies as acid rain. while many politicians have only recently seen their green light many diesel engine manufacturers have looked further ahead , and have been developing cleaner engines , principally in response to stringent american legislation. the result will be a common level of nox and particular emissions from vehicles ( measured in grammes per kilowat hour ) from vehicles sold in europe after 1991. unlike lead , which the fuel companies eventually proved only too pleased to take out_of petrol , sulphur does nothing for either the performance or longevity of diesel engines and it contributes to acid rain. currently , diesel fuel sold in the ec contains 0.3 per_cent sulphur , except in west germany where the level is 0.25 per_cent.
