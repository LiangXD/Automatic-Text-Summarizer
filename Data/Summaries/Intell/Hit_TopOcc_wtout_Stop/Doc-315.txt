space station's railcar slightly off track cape canaveral - (ap) -- astronauts sent the international space station's new railcar rolling slowly down a short stretch of track monday, but it quickly hit a snag that interrupted the inaugural run of the first permanent railroad in orbit. the railcar will eventually be used during the next stages of the space station's construction. ground controllers took over manual control and, a few hours later, were able to latch the railcar to the track. space station astronaut carl walz sent another computer command from inside to get the railcar moving again. later monday, walz commanded the railcar to move for the third and final time, back down the same 26 feet of track. there is no danger of the $190 million railcar rolling off the track because of rings on both ends of the 44-foot girder, sellari said. the railcar is needed to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm from one end of the outpost to the other as more girders are installed.
