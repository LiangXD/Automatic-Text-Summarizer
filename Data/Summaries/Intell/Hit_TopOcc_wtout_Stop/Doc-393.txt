navy officer balances religious responsibilities miami herald january 31, 2002 navy officer balances religious responsibilities by carol rosenberg guantanamo bay naval base, cuba -- you're the first-ever american muslim cleric to minister to a prison camp full of suspected terrorists and one confides he has a weapon. as a u.s. military chaplain, his contacts with prisoners are governed by the same confidentiality as that of a priest, minister or rabbi in the clergy corps. but mostly he's a busy man, trying to soothe muslim sensitivities over the rugged chain-linked-fence cells at camp x-ray. until he emerged as the chaplain of choice for this special assignment from among only 14 muslim clerics in the u.s. armed forces, he was the only cleric specifically assigned to a marine corps base -- at camp pendleton, calif. military recruiters building a muslim chaplains corps spotted saiful-islam in 1993, while he was an enlisted man working as a payroll clerk in the pentagon and studying part-time to become a muslim cleric. others require the services of arabic interpreters -- who, like saiful-islam, are u.s. military men in battle dress uniforms. so far no one has asked him how a practicing muslim can also wear the uniform of the u.s. armed forces.
