japan carmakers weather palladium market turmoil. keiko takagi tokyo 1997-03-31 japan's carmakers are weathering turmoil in the palladium market , including a halt in russian shipments to japan and volatile prices , without major changes in their purchasing practices , industry sources say. palladium and other platinum group metals are used to make key components for catalytic converters , used in car and truck engines to clean exhaust emissions. _ there has been no major shift in our purchasing patterns so_far , _ said a purchasing manager at toyota tsusho corp , trading arm of the toyota motor corp group. _ palladium prices are still relatively low and we are not overly concerned about the russian situation , as we expect russia to resume platinum group metal exports before long , _ he added. russian supplies of platinum group metals to japan have been on hold since the start of the year , when export contracts for 1996 expired and the russian side indefinitely postponed talks on this year's contracts due_to domestic budget wrangling. japanese trade houses have scrambled in recent months to cover the palladium lost from russian contracts by buying in the spot market. a purchasing manager at nissan motor co said , however , that she did not feel the palladium market was extremely tight at present , partly because most japanese carmakers have long-term palladium supply contracts with south african mining houses. nissan has been the most aggressive of japan's carmakers in switching to palladium-only or palladium-rich catalysts in its domestic cars , analysts said. _ we are not mulling any changes in metals used in our auto catalysts at this stage , as changes to existing models would require huge expenditures and time for registration , _ the nissan source said. _ but in the future when new models are launched , a change is possible if the suspension of russian supplies is prolonged , _ she added.
