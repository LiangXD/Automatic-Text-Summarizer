's big defense and automotive electronics unit, gm hughes electronics, said net income fell 22% in the third quarter, reflecting declining military spending and slumping gm vehicle production. meanwhile, net at gm's finance arm, general motors acceptance corp., fell 3.1%. the earnings drop at gm hughes electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of hughes aircraft co. and gm's north american automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the delco electronics corp. side of the gm hughes unit. in addition, gm's north american vehicle production fell 8.4% from a year ago, which hurt delco electronic's earnings, a company spokesman said. in the nine months, gm hughes net fell 6.6% to $486.6 million, or $1.48 a share, from $521 million, or $1.58 a share. gmac profits are combined with earnings from the rest of gm's operations and attributed to the company's traditional common stock. in the first nine months, gmac's earnings fell 8% to $859.5 million from $930.2 million.
