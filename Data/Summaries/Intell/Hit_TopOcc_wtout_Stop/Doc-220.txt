state visit: the us president is getting good reviews from political experts for refusing to restate the 'three nos' and declining to endorse peaceful reunification as us president george w. bush wrapped up his six-day visit to asia yesterday, analysts gave their thumbs up to his determination to voice his firm support for taiwan despite pressure from china to do otherwise. while past trips to china by us presidents have produced agreements or statements that have damaged taiwan's interests, bush's visit only enhanced the nation's confidence in his administration, cheng said. notably, he didn't restate the so-called 'three nos' policy, said dpp legislator parris chang (chang hsu-ch'eng) of bush's remarks on taiwan during his two-day trip to beijing that concluded yesterday afternoon. bush has been very forthcoming in stating the us commitment to defend taiwan against the possible use of force by china, said chang, a specialist in international relations. china has tried to highlight and accentuate the taiwan issue during bush's trip to china, but the us agenda rested instead on anti-terrorism and china's proliferation of arms sale to countries like iran and pakistan, chang argued. but as bush concluded his trip to asia yesterday, it was clear that china failed to elicit from him a statement on the three nos and on opposition to taiwanese independence, chang said. the us' rising concerns over china's military expansion and its appreciation for taipei's support for the us-led war against terrorism drove bush to stand firm in his support for taiwan, the dpp legislator said.
