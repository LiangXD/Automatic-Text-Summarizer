the fall and rise of hugo chavez washington times april 25, 2002 pg. president hugo chavez is once again at the helm of power, and the military has returned to its barracks. mr. chavez was ousted in a military coup on april 12 after 17 persons were killed during an anti-chavez protest, apparently by sharpshooters faithful to the president. according to taped radio conversations broadcast yesterday in venezuela on radio and television, mr. chavez ordered tanks and troops to surround the presidential palace, as unarmed civilian protesters marched against him on april 11. indeed, after all the muscle-flexing, mr. chavez has little to offer the venezuelan people. in fact, mr. chavez consolidated his power by rewriting the country's constitution in 1999. interestingly, mr. chavez initially rose to power in the 1990s because of the discontent with former president carlos andres perez, who had ordered the military to shoot at crowds in 1989.
