cubans celebrate venezuelan president's return to power, compare botched coup to bay of pigs havana - (ap) -- thousands of cubans celebrated venezuelan president hugo chavez's return to power at a rally tuesday, likening the failed coup against the cuban ally to the disastrous u.s.-backed effort to overthrow fidel castro's government 41 years ago. about 4,000 castro supporters -- workers, students, housewives and retirees -- gathered on the streetcorner where the cuban leader declared the country socialist in a speech on the eve of the april 17, 1961 bay of pigs invasion by an american-trained exile army. he said it was a "beautiful historic coincidence" that the celebration came so soon after venezuelans "have written a page of dignity and honor by going out into the streets to overthrow the coup attempt." both castro and chavez are leftists who see themselves as revolutionary leaders. castro considers chavez a friend and his closest political ally in the region, and their close ties have rankled the united states. cuba was swift to denounce the venezuelan president's ouster friday -- reversed two days later when chavez was reinstated by loyalist military officers after demonstrations calling for his return. at the bay of pigs, a cia-trained force of about 1,500 exiles invaded in an effort to overthrow castro's government, which had seized power 28 months before.
