angry at vote, commonwealth bars zimbabwe london, march 19 - flanked by the presidents of south africa and nigeria, prime minister john howard of australia today announced a yearlong suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth, a group of 54 nations, mostly former british colonies. the two african leaders, thabo mbeki of south africa and olusegun obasanjo of nigeria, maintained a cryptic silence while mr. howard spoke, endorsing the decision by their presence at a news conference but avoiding embroilment in a debate over whether they now view mr. mugabe's presidency as illegitimate. mr. mbeki and mr. obasanjo - both of whose countries have under past undemocratic regimes been excluded from the commonwealth - are torn between solidarity with a fellow african leader who was a crusader against colonialism, and their commitment to democratic standards as part of african economic regeneration. the committee has decided to suspend zimbabwe from the councils of the commonwealth for a period of one year with immediate effect, mr. howard said, reading the statement alone, apparently as a face-saving gesture to mr. mbeki, whose own election observers in zimbabwe found the vote legitimate. the response to mr. mugabe's behavior was seen by many outsiders as a token of south africa's and nigeria's own commitment to democracy as a way of fostering economic renewal. if the commonwealth had not suspended zimbabwe - an act mr. howard saw as at the severe end of available punishments - such criticism would only have sharpened. according to the statement, the leaders of south africa and nigeria will continue to talk to mr. mugabe about ways to lift the suspension.
