mugabe confident of victory in historic zimbabwe vote harare-zimbabwean president robert mugabe predicted victory saturday as he cast his ballots in presidential and local elections at a primary school in harare's working-class suburb of highfield. mugabe has faced widespread criticism and sanctions from the european union and the united states over alleged rights violations and manipulation of the election process. tinkering has left voting procedures so confusing in harare that even mugabe and his top aides appeared unsure of where the president was to vote. mugabe was clearly expected to turn up at mhofu school in highfield, where state television had a truck posted and had been broadcasting live since polls opened early saturday. several of mugabe's ministers and senior aides were also on hand to see their leader cast his ballot, as well as a throng of reporters and camera operators. mugabe had to vote at that particular ward in order to be able to cast ballots both for president and for mayor in harare, which is holding the two elections simultaneously. the opposition movement for democratic change (mdc) complained that the set-up was deliberately confusing in a ploy to discourage the urban vote, which is thought to favor mugabe's challenger morgan tsvangirai. -afp @ pakistan observer 1998-2001
