zimbabwean presidential vote begins author: angus shaw harare, zimbabwe (ap) - zimbabweans waited in long lines outside polling stations saturday, some knitting and playing with their children, while waiting for the chance to vote in elections that present the strongest challenge yet to president robert mugabe. mugabe's name did not appear on the list at the polling station in the harare township where he had planned to vote. police have canceled scores of opposition rallies and mugabe has used his presidential powers to restore controversial election laws struck down by the supreme court that appear to make it easier to rig the vote. the opposition says scores of its polling agents have been detained or harassed the government refused to accredit most independent zimbabwean voting monitors, but many of them showed up outside of polling stations anyway. lines snaked around polling stations in harare, one of them more than a mile long. the lines were far longer than during parliamentary elections in june 2000, which saw a strong challenge to mugabe's zimbabwe african national union patriotic front party, though it narrowly won. the opposition had asked the supreme court to overturn mugabe's decree restoring the controversial election laws, as well as to resolve confusion over voter registration and the location of polling stations and allow the polls to remain open if long lines made it impossible for some to vote.
