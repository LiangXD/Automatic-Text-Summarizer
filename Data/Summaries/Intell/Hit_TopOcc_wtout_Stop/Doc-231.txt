seven months after having rejected the kyoto protocol because he considered it to be without scientific basis, detrimental to us economic interests, and unfair in not obliging medium-sized nations (like brazil and india) to reduce their gas emissions in the same proportion as that imposed on industrialized countries, bush made public the plan that, he promised, would not have any of the defects of the kyoto protocol and would achieve the same, if not better, results. basically, the bush plan makes the reduction in pollution gas emissions conditional on the gross domestic product (gdp) growth rate. emissions of these gases should rise at a slower pace than that of the gdp, he says. the first problem pointed out by critics is that bush has created a new concept, that of greenhouse gas intensity, which could be defined as the volume of gas emissions divided by gdp. therefore, that so-called 18 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could, in fact, represent a real increase in the absolute quantity of such gases. some environmental entities calculate that bush's plan will lead to the us's emitting! , in 2010, 29 percent more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990. the break with kyoto had been a pre-attack marker in the bush administration, for having demonstrated the latter's absolute indifference to the opinion of even its closest allies, such as germany, france, the united kingdom, and japan.
