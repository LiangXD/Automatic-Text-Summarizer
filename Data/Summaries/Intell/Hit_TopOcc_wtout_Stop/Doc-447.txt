dear friends of pleasant run: the holiday season is the time of year when we're all busy buying gifts, baking goodies, decorating our homes and making arrangements to be with family and friends. pleasant run cares for at-risk children and families. today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a contribution to pleasant run to help the 1,500 children families we care for. many of the children have no homes no memories of joy from past holidays. a gift to pleasant run means the children in our care will have presents to open. a gift means a family will have a holiday meal, cooking utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on. let our families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of memories of the holidays you will have.
