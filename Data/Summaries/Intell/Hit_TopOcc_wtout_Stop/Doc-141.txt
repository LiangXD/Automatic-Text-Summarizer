leaders of the united states probably withheld their breath monday evening while watching on television what russian president vladimir putin was about to say to his people. putin has exceeded the positive neutrality policy his country (the soviet union at the time) has pursued during the gulf war, and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable. the situation in which putin has agreed to open former soviet military airfields to american armed forces in three (former soviet) central asian countries could be regarded as dramatic. true, putin only permitted (americans) to deliver via russian airspace aid to the theater of the anti-terrorism military operations, (i.e. not soldiers and weapons). but main stream russian military policy has been to keep a distance from america, the country that has been historically responsible for educating the taliban that had caused the demise of soviet occupation forces in afghanistan. after the americans had promised everything good and nice, putin remarked almost as an aside that the events in chechnia could be interpreted only in the context of the struggle against international terrorism. nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the united states called upon the chechens to unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups, and that they accept putin's offer to make peace.
