canadarm2 lays track for space railway subhead: 'a unique and highly complex robot working in an extremely hostile environment': improved mobility author: broward liston cape canaveral, fla. - the first railway in outer space was ready to roll yesterday after astronauts from the space shuttle atlantis prepped it for its inaugural run. the rail car, installed outside the international space station on the crew's first spacewalk, will have a top speed of just three centimetres per second, but ground controllers may not open up the throttle all the way in their first test today anyway. the rail car is part of the 13-metre-long s-0 truss, the centerpiece of what is to be a 120-metre girder running the length of the space station. in a spacewalk lasting more than six hours, astronauts steve smith and rex walheim, the same team that mounted the new truss segment on to the station last thursday, released launch restraints on the rail car, which rode to space in the shuttle's cargo bay. the small trolley is designed to roll the station's canadarm2 robotic arm from one construction site to another as work progresses on the station over the next several years. the massive robotic arm, canada's contribution to the multi-national space station, lifted the truss segment out and away from the shuttle's cargo bay and attached it on the station's laboratory module. the arm was then used for the first time to move the spacewalking astronauts to different work sites around the newly installed truss.
