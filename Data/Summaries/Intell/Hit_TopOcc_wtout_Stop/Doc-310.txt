africa endorses mugabe victory, the west condemns it international reaction to the controversial re-election of zimbabwean president robert mugabe to another six year term varied widely. observer missions from south africa, nigeria, namibia and the organisation of african unity (oau) respectively, described the poll as legitimate - largely satisfactory and transparent, credible, free and fair. president daniel arap moi of kenya congratulated mugabe, calling his victory testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of zimbabwe hold in you. that position chimed closely with views expressed by the main zimbabwean monitoring group, the zimbabwe election support network which had 400 observers monitoring the poll and have been heavily critical. norway prime minister jan petersen said in a statement that the presidential election in zimbabwe has not satisfied the fundamental requirements for a democratic election. australia, which with south africa and nigeria has been mandated to report on the zimbabwe presidential poll to the commonwealth, was equally critical. the united nations' secretary-general, kofi annan, appealed for calm after the poll and urged zimbabweans to refrain from violence.
