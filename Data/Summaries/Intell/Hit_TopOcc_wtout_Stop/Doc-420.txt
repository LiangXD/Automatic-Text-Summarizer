the sheiks started teaching people about these ideas, this conspiracy is led by two sides, the first is the heads of the tribes, the second is the leaders of the islamic party and mosques speakers, so they announced their war on the mujahidin, it increased during the elections for the new constitution, their danger was so great, that hundreds of people volunteered in the police and the army, and thousands of people participated in the elections, renouncing their religion, and listenning to the erratics. my sheik, here's some of the events that happened in ramadi: 1- sheik nasr al-fahdawi, sheik of albufahd tribe, was nominated to be the governor of anbar, this man worked so hard fighting the (tanzim)organization, with all he's got, from money to power, and reputation in ramadi, so we tried this @ with him: first, we backed off during the elections, they had checkpoints, using tens of his tribesmen who started checking cars, they violated our brothers many times, they even announced it, then our brothers attacked the field leader, the brain behind people revolting at al-anbar in albufahd, so the brothers raided his house in the middle of the night wearing the national guards uniform and driving similar cars, they took him and killed him thank god. 2- sheik of albu'ubaid (salah al-dhari), who slaughtered thirty sheeps in one dinner party, where he invited heads and sheiks of tribes in ramadi, to encourage their youth to join the police and the national guard, and that's two days before the murder of sheik nasr al-fahdawi, after that he announced his repentance at the mosque twice infront of albu'ubaid tribe, denouncing who joins the police and army, and sorry for all he's done, without any pressure or threats from the brothers, also the brothers didn't announce the claim for any of the killings. as for the heads of the islamic party, our brothers been monitoring them for so long, but ignored them during the elections, then their vicious role appeared, with their call to form police and army after the elections, we found that the main thinker behind the party's ideas is sheik abd al-ghafur al-kubaysi the imam and speaker of of al-shafi'i mosque in ramadi, and made his mosque the center of all the party's meetings, with all that, he didn't stop fighting the brothers with his speeches at the mosque, so the brothers assasinated him near his house, after he left the mosque going home, and there was no reaction by the islamic party or people, except that they raised signs condemning the killing. we did not follow this policy until we ran out of time, from past experience where we let things go, like kataib al-hamza (hamza brigades), and albumahal tribe in al-qaim, where we should've eliminated them then, but what happened happened, also muhsin abd al-hamid etc... and you sheik said that yourself god bless you, also in fallujah where brothers neglected on killing the heads of infidelity, and what happened also happened. we have no problem with you saying for us to give the name of the person before killing him, but we owe god, this will only be a delay for us, and time is not on our side, and for you to say to kill him outside his city, sometimes it take months before the person leaves his city, like if it's in baghdad for example, that's difficult, and time is not on our side, we waited to cut the heads of the renegades in hit, then 130 renegades came out to us for the reason that we didn't destroy the islamic party there, but we're working on it, for example we didn't kill nasr al-fahdawi at his home in al-sajriyah, but the guys waited for him until he got out of the ramadi province. 8- zahir muhammad 'awwad al-'ubaydi, manager of sunni endowment, for attending the last meeting with al-ja'fari, also for attending a conference in jordan, that was presesnted to you, he's one of the people calling to form the police and national guard, we'll kill him outside al-ramadi zone, when he goes to the government building. <lu_annotate> we have restrictions on beheading the heads of the islamic party members, the sheik of the tribes, and renegages, present it to the council if you prefer: 1- there must be time priorities.
