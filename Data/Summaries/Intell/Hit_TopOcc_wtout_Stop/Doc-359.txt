zimbabwe vote a test of patience harare and rushinga, zimbabwe - martha's neighbors know her as a high-ranking district official of zimbabwe's ruling zanu-pf party, the woman who drills local children each friday in the party doctrine. there are many marthas here, people who marched to zanu-pf anthems and cheered president robert mugabe at rallies, while secretly planning to vote for mr. tsvangirai. the government slashed the number of polling stations in urban areas where the mdc is favored, while boosting the number in rural ruling-party strongholds. rural bindura had 41 polling stations for a smaller number of people. the question foremost in the minds of most zimbabweans is whether attempts to rig the election through voter intimidation, last- minute election-law changes, and outright fraud have succeeded. mugabe is trying to move the goal posts to disenfranchise people, these people he thinks will vote against him, said tsvangirai, visiting one polling station where thousands waited angrily to cast their votes, waving their hands in the open-handed signal of the mdc. old and illiterate voters were assisted by zanu-pf officials who often directed them to vote for the incumbent president.
