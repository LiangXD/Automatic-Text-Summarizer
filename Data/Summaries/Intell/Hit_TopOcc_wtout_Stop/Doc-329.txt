where there are not even polls, in the tyrannies of the middle east, of africa and asia, there is occasional evidence of the respect that the united states can command -- the belief that for all its flaws, the united states remains the champion of freedom. potential terrorists may well be concealed among them, but for the great majority, it is common knowledge that the united states is a land of freedom and opportunity -- the preferred destination of the world's emigrants for the better part of the past two centuries. often enough, the radicals who spout anti-american doctrines imbibed them amidst the safety and leisure of u.s. campus life. and while the conventional and verbal anti-americanism is in a different league from the terrorist strikes -- closer to hypocrisy than to murderous hatred -- i think the two are animated by a common cause: a cause to be sought in the murk of the individual human soul, not in the externals of political argument. voices stilled by horror in the wake of the terror attacks on america, resumed their anti-american tirade when the united states took action in afghanistan, and recently raised the pitch over the prisoners issue at guantanamo bay. for while the left has compounded anti-americanism into dogma, the right in canada, europe and beyond, participates in the envy of u.s. success. let me pause only briefly to allow that america is imperfect, like all earthly things that its governments and people have committed many sins that might does not make right that power and wealth are not good in themselves that goodness, truth and beauty may be found in every country and town.
