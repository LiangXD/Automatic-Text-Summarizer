shuttle atlantis thunders toward space station cape canaveral - seven astronauts and a truckload of hardware are racing toward the international space station following the successful blastoff monday of the space shuttle atlantis. the launch was the first of six scheduled for the next seven months in a flurry of activity designed to get the space station closer to completion. the launch came after a four-day delay caused when a liquid hydrogen vent pipe sprung a leak during fueling on thursday. "you spent a few extra days in florida," nasa launch director mike leinbach told atlantis commander mike bloomfield moments before liftoff. the launch was a milestone in u.s. space flight. in four space walks during the 11-day mission, astronauts will install the "keystone" center support unit for the international space station. the 44-foot-long, 27,000-pound "s-zero" structure's first job will be to support a new solar energy array nearly an acre in size, stretching more than a football field in length.
