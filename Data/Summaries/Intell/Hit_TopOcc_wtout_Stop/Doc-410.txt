december 10, 1996 dear mailhouse donor reminder: you and i have done some important work together. we've helped people break free of the welfare cycle. we've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce. we've expanded goodwill's proven methods to towns and neighborhoods where they are needed most. you have helped make goodwill's work possible with your previous support. there are a lot of barriers that keep people from working: physical and mental disabilities, history of welfare dependency and lack of education or self-esteem. and there are a lot of people who face these challenges every day of their lives.
