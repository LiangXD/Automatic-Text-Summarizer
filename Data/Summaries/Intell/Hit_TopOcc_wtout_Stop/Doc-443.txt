jameson points the way for children who need that extra hand and i hope you'll continue your support this year. in just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids and a few extra activities to a team of almost 60 young adults taking on real projects. yl teens will make j.c. juniors happen again this year for 7 and 8 year old campers. a five day camp, j.c. juniors introduces at-risk children to jameson two years earlier than we could previously reach them. the teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for other campers because they know what jameson has meant to them. sincerely, julie marsh, executive director p.s. you make it possible for us to help special kids with learning disabilities, behavior problems and economic disadvantages to gain the confidence required to put genuine effort into achieving real goals. i hope you'll continue -- and if possible increase - your support for these great kids.
