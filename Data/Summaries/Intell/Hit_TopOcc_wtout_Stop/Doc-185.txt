israel's persistent and deliberate fuelling of the cycle of violence in the palestinian territories is pushing our already turbulent region towards inevitable chaos and war. this behaviour further confirms what has long been very clear the government of prime minister ariel sharon is more interested in pursuing its expansionist designs on occupied palestinian and arab land than in engaging in serious peace-making -- a route that would require its unreserved commitment. and therefore, it has blatantly obstructed all international, us, european, and regional efforts to consolidate an israeli-palestinian ceasefire as a prerequisite for the implementation of the mitchell and tenet recommendations. 11 tragedy in the us to intensify and accelerate its aggression against the palestinians and crush their efforts towards claiming their legitimate rights to freedom and independence. sharon's likening of his invasion of palestinian territories and the assassinations to the us-led war against the taleban and osama ben laden is abhorrent. sharon's deceptive ploys cannot negate the fact that president yasser arafat and the palestinian national authority have and are still, even while under attack, doing their utmost to demonstrate their unambiguous commitment to stop violence, maintain the ceasefire, and get back to negotiations. the calls from washington and london for the just and legitimate realisation of palestinian statehood as part of such a settlement, should be viewed by the israeli leadership as a guarantee of israel's peace and security, but continued violence and aggression, as history has shown time and again, is a recipe for disaster.
