but it was the uncertainty with which her rival, bavarian premier edmund stoiber of the christian social union, the cdu's bavarian sister party, also shrouded himself that made the question of who would lead the union parties into the 22 september elections as chancellor candidate against incumbent gerhard schroeder, so exciting. mr. stoiber has come a long way from his refusal to sacrifice himself for the cdu in an election that once looked impossible to win, through his statement that he would under no circumstances run against the wishes of ms. merkel and her party, to his willingness to take her on in a divisive vote if necessary. mr. stoiber carefully tread the path to the candidacy, spurred on by many and reined in by others. mr. stoiber seized it once the cdu made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman. certainly, mr. stoiber has done everything in his power to spare himself the fate of his mentor, franz josef strauss. if anyone in their ranks can turn this to their advantage, it is mr. stoiber. nor will mr. stoiber have any illusions of what it means to lead an election campaign, although he can be confident in the knowledge that what is at stake is not edmund stoiber, nor the union, but germany as a whole.
