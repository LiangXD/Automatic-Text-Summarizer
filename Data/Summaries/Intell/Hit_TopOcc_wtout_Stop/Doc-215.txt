their beards shaven off: for hygiene, say the camp's military commanders to humiliate them in their religion, reply human rights defenders half the world over. that world which had looked in tears at the photos and the pictures of september 11, the towers collapsing, and the infamy against civilization, and which is now discovering these other photos, the first ones to come out of camp x-ray, the open-air prison which the united states has set up at guantanamo base, their historic outpost on the island of cuba. but the photos of 'gitmo' are now in danger of removing the united states from the niche of affection and solidarity which september 11 had guaranteed it in the hearts of many people. the bbc has been posing questions about those photos which are stirring up protests, and many people believe them to be a scandal : photos taken in part at the landing of the c17s after the trip from afghanistan, which already showed the prisoners reduced to objects, with gags, masked goggles, and ear muffs. i am shocked -- he said -- because they still wear the ear muffs and the goggles inside the camp. outside the camp, there lies the absurd small piece of the united states which is guanatanamo on cuban soil: a mcdonald's outlet, the school with its yellow bus for the children of families living on the base, the store windows with the latest roller-blades at 50 dollars, and the cinema, currently showing 'domestic disturbance.' morton haplerin, from the council for foreign relations, said: it is clear that the united states sees guantanamo as a place where it can gather persons caught in all parts of the world.
