mmm f_name l_name title company address city,st zip march 4, 1999 dear ltr_name: cci has come a long way in the last five years. it's clear that if we don't increase our base of private funding, we won't have the kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers and the very important services they offer. the community initiatives committee is working with our development office to put together a long-range fundraising plan that will ultimately bring more money into our centers. this in turn will help us to increase and even improve the services we offer. i also encourage you to seek additional support through your company, church, or service organization. your financial support of the development process is just one step in making cci a stronger, more efficient and ultimately more effective federation of service providers. sincerely, j.chris graffeo chair p.s. if you have any questions, feel free to call valery de long at cci, 638-3360 x23.
