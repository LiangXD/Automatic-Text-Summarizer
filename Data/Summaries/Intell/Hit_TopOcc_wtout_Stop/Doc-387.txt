72 hours at camp x-ray guantanamo bay naval base, cuba - it begins as a shiny speck in the southeast skies of the lone landing strip here at gitmo, the oldest u.s. base overseas. they board buses that will take them to a ferry that will take them across guantanamo bay to a detention facility known as camp x-ray. a sign near the ferry slip conveys some of the strange vibe of guantanamo, a 45-square mile naval base in which the detention camp comprises some 3 acres. last wednesday, the 10th flight from kandahar to the southeastern tip of cuba arrived, bringing the total number of detainees at camp x-ray to 288. 11. when the detainees arrive at camp x-ray, they are told they're in cuba and then undergo a 45-minute intake process, which, like the airstrip landing, is monitored by the red cross. sean campion, one of the camp guards, characterizes life at camp x-ray as utter boredom. the growth of the base has left camp x-ray surprisingly close to a suburban-style military community of beige, green and yellow houses in subdivisions with names like caribbean circle and west iguana.
