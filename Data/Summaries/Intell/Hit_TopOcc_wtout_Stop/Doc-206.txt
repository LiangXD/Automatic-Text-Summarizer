recently, the information office of the chinese people's congress released a report on human rights in the united states in 2001, criticizing violations of human rights there. evidence show that human rights violations in the united states have been ignored for many years. the united states has been preparing annual reports on human rights in 190 countries for 25 years while ignoring the real situation at home. world analysts remarked that the us evaluation of the practice of human rights in other countries depends on the level of political relations between the united states and those countries. the british news agency reuters remarked that in the 2000 human rights report, the united states criticized egypt for trying suspected terrorists in military courts. however, such a criticism is absent in the 2001 human rights report as the united states is planning to try the al-qa'ida and taliban detainees in military courts while refusing to grant them pow status. in light of the united states' malicious goals, its annual human rights report for 2001 is facing strong protest and criticism from the world.
