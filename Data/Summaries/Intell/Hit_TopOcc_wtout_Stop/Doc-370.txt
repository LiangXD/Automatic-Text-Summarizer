the president had made a last- ditch effort to form a unity government today with the leading opposition party, but when that was rejected, he announced he would leave. mr. de la r?resignation will put the country's immediate future in the hands of the moderate opposition party that controls congress and had recently begun blocking many of the former president's policies. but congress can change that, and how it will play its hand will be largely left to opposition leaders, including a former president, carlos sa?nem, and senator eduardo duhalde, who lost to mr. de la r? the 1999 elections. mr. de la r?government collapsed with surprising rapidity, as the police fired shotguns at demonstrators in front of his palace, tear gas seeped into presidential offices and fires filled the grand boulevards and avenues of buenos aires with towers of black smoke. but his assumption of emergency powers appeared only to incite greater protests, beginning with an outpouring of thousands of people wednesday night onto the streets of buenos aires, banging pots and pans and demanding mr. de la r?resignation. in an attempt to save his government, mr. de la r?4, went on national television on wednesday night and apologized to the people for their disappointment in his administration's performance. mr. de la r?decline began in october 2000 with the resignation of his vice president, carlos alvarez, over the government's handling of charges that bribes were paid to opposition senators to pass a new labor law.
