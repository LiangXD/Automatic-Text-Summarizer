harsh detention for afghan prisoners taleban and al-qaeda prisoners flown from afghanistan to an american naval base in the caribbean are being held in tough conditions of detention. a temporary detention centre called camp x-ray has been set up at the base in guantanamo bay, an isolated us outpost on the edge of fidel castro's cuba. the first group to arrive - 20 prisoners described by us military officials as the worst elements of al-qaeda and the taleban - wore goggles covered with tape and had their hands tied. american marines landed in guantanamo during the spanish-american war in 1898, and the base was established under a 1903 treaty. hunt continues american officials have named al-qaeda and taleban leaders killed or captured as frustration grows that some senior taleban figures are reportedly slipping through the net. among those who have not been questioned by the us military are three former taleban ministers who turned themselves into the new afghan authorities - only to be allowed to return to their homes. the most important is former justice minister mullah nuruddin turabi - known to be close to taleban leader mullah omar - former defence minister mullah ubaidullah and former industry minister mullah saadudin.
