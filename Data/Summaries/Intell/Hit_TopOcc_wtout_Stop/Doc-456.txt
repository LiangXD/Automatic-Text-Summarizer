5:14pm sat may 4th, 2002 -- thirty-two non-governmental organisations [ngos] today said they have suspended all engagements with the malaysian human rights commission or suhakam for 100 days since april 24 - when the latest appointments to the commission took effect. speaking on behalf of the ngos , human rights organisation, hakam president ramdas tikamdas said the boycott was to protest the government's poor response to suhakam's numerous recommendations thus far. the ngos stressed the government has also failed to respect or recognise suhakam's recommendations and also lamented the decline of human rights in malaysia. the ngos also noted that the government has yet to show its commitment and respect for universal human rights principles by ratifying the international instruments of human rights, namely the international covenant on civil and political rights, the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights and the covenant against torture. we will also note to what extent suhakam will monitor the government's compliance with previous recommendations on various human rights issues contained in its maiden report to the parliament as well as its other reports, he added. ramdas said suhakam's performance will be judged not on the number of statements issued or reports produced but on the improvement of human rights in malaysia. instead of resorting to such measures, the commissioner said the ngos should work with suhakam for the advancement of human rights in this country.
