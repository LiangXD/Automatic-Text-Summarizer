chicago 1997-03-31 turnover remained relatively slow in major u.s. stock index options despite the continued slide , traders said monday. one trader in chicago said the low volume indicated the selloff may not be over. _ what i see is low volume and when you have low volume in a dropping market , that_ 's not good because you do_ n't get the climax , _ he said. _ looking at it today , this is not the climax becaue the volume is very low. _ by late trading , the bellwether dow industrial average was down 111 points , or 1.65 percent , at about 6,630. a string of economic reports , including the key jobs report , which is scheduled for release friday , was one factor keeping investors sidelined , but traders said last week's selloff also was a factor. _ as far as buying , there has_ n't been a lot , _ the trader in chicago said. _ everyone is just holding their breath. _ nobody is paying up for the puts _ where premiums remained rich , he said , adding that some investors were buying puts , expecting a bounce. one broker in chicago said some investors were attempting to play the oex options , but wide spreads and stiff premiums made them difficult to trade. he agreed activity was quiet. _ the market goes down and nobody wants to do anything , _ he said. _ if we get some kind of a reversal , i_ 'm sure we_ 'll get some action. _ some analysts continued to look for some quarter-ending portfolio buying to emerge and support the market , but others noted that investor complacency appeared to be high , which is a bearish sign in a declining market. jerry hegarty , an analyst at thomson financial services , said in a report that by afternoon , oex put buying topped call buying by only 6,000 contracts despite the market's drop. he cited three sentiment indicators that all showed a notable drop in bullishness recently. _ we believe that these_kind_of psychological reaction are healthy amid a long term market uptrend , _ sunderman said in the report.
