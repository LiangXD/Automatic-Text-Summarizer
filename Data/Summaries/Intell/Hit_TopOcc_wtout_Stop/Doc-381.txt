zimbabwe's rigged election the election this week in zimbabwe was an ugly travesty from which all of southern africa will suffer. unfortunately, some leading african countries like south africa and nigeria have compounded the problem by accepting mugabe's victory despite earlier assertions that they would not recognize the results of a rigged election. by failing to hold firm they not only damage their diplomatic credibility, but also ignore the consequences for nearby african states of mugabe's misrule. these steps would be far more effective if they were joined by major african states. mugabe, who led zimbabwe's liberation struggle against white minority rule in the late 1970's, has systematically wrecked his country's economy and its freedoms to prolong his 22-year-old hold on power. it is blessed with fertile agricultural land, and during the first dozen years of mugabe's rule it was relatively prosperous and free. thugs and fraud cannot keep the 78-year-old mugabe in power forever.
