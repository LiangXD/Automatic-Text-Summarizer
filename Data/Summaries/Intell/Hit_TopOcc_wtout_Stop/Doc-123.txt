28 (cna) -- the taipei-based chinese federation of labor (cfl) attended the asian regional meeting of the international labor organization (ilo) held tuesday in bangkok, mainly because of its work to protect foreign laborers in taiwan. cfl president lin hui-kuan led the taiwan delegation to the meeting in the name of observer of the international confederation of free trade union (icftu). it was the first time that a taiwan labor group has been invited to participate in a meeting of the ilo, which is an affiliate of the united nations. the cfl's participation in the meeting did not meet with any objection from beijing, as it attended as an observer of a non-u.n. organization. taiwan is the only country in asia that allows foreign laborers to enjoy the same salary levels as their local counterparts, which elevates its image in international society, lin added. however, through the protests of local labor groups, foreign laborers' working rights were protected, bringing extra attention to the power of taiwan labor groups. lin noted that taiwan is one of the icftu founders and that its participation in the ilo can serve as a model for taiwan to take part in international activities.
