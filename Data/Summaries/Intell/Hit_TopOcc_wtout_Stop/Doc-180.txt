his remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of kandahar after northern alliance troops finally entered kunduz. but commons leader mr cook said: if you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put british troops into the ground civil war and i don't myself imagine that's going to change. news of the kandahar negotiations came after the taliban control crumbled in their final northern stronghold of kunduz following mass surrender. the city's top taliban commander was among thousands of afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting. the surrender took days to hammer out, primarily because hard core taliban and foreign troops from usama bin ladin's al-qa'ida terror network did not want to give up. hundreds of foreign fighters captured in the siege of the northern city were killed in a prison riot at a fortress outside mazar-e-sharif, the northern alliance said. there are some talks and negotiations going on there (in kandahar) with the taliban to surrender themselves, gen mohammed zaer azimi said in herat.
