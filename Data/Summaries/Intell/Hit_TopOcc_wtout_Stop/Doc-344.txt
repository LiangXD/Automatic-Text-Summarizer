zimbabwe's president is sworn in subhead: lawmakers boycott event author: by jon jeter harare, zimbabwe - president robert mugabe was sworn in sunday for his fifth term in office following a bitterly fought election that the opposition and many western governments denounced as rigged. speaking publicly for the first time since government election officials declared him the winner four days ago, mugabe returned to the themes he struck during his campaign against morgan tsvangirai, a former trade union leader. all said they were protesting an election they said had been tainted by months of political violence and intimidation, last-minute changes to electoral laws, and the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters in harare -- an opposition stronghold -- who failed to vote because the government reduced the number of polling stations. the takeovers and occupations of farms, lack of transparency and political violence have led many international donors to cut funding to zimbabwe, which is in the fourth year of a recession and a worsening food shortage. mugabe appealed to the nation and the opposition to reconcile to address the pressing economic needs, but fell short of proposing a government of national unity. south african president thabo mbeki and nigerian president olusegun obasanjo are pressing mugabe to accept such an arrangement to avoid deepening international sanctions and suspension from the commonwealth of britain and its former colonies. investors and western diplomats have said they might interpret mbeki's support for mugabe or the elections as a sign that africa is not intent on revitalizing its economies through good government and expanded international trade.
