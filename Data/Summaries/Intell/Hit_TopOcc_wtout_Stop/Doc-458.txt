the flagrant attack, which condoleezza rice launched on the palestinian leadership yesterday, demonstrates how international dictatorship is practiced by the most powerful country on earth, which claims to be democratic and an advocate of nations' right to choose their leaders. rice attacks the palestinian leadership, which was democratically elected, as testified by international observers, including former us presidents. however, she refrains from mentioning the elected israeli leadership, which moved the israeli army to occupy palestinian cities, destroy homes over the heads of their owners, arrest thousands of innocent people, and carry out what many legal and international humanitarian circles described as war crimes or bloody massacres to say the least. yet, the palestinian leadership is denounced and attacked while the israeli prime minister is praised. no one, no matter who it is, has the right to meddle in the palestinian domestic affairs or to impose on the palestinian people a leadership favored by the us administration and the israeli government and tailored according to their mutual interests. the first is that the current palestinian leadership represents the palestinian people's will, political convictions, and national aspirations. the second fact is that if washington is interested in democratic reforms in order to combat terrorism as it says it is, it should pressure the israeli leadership to end its occupation of the palestinian territories and stop its repressive practices against the palestinian people.
