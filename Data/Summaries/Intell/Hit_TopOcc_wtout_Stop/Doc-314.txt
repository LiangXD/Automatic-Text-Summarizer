venezuela's new dawn bbc correspondent in caracas venezuelans awoke on friday to a country transformed by the dramatic and violent events of the last 24 hours, which left at least 11 people dead and more than 80 injured. the country was no longer the bolivarian republic of venezuela, in honour of south american independence hero simon bolivar, one of former president hugo chavez's heroes. as marchers called for mr chavez's resignation outside miraflores, the presidential palace, shots were fired into the crowd. chavez's last day at the time, mr chavez was addressing the nation to assure them his government respected people's right to demonstrate and freedom of the press. in the early hours of the morning, chief of the armed forces general lucas rincon held a brief news conference to say mr chavez's resignation had been demanded and accepted. news of mr chavez's resignation caused hundreds of flag-waving and whistle-blowing venezuelans to surround the city's air force base, la carlota, in the hope of seeing mr chavez' departure from the country. mr chavez's exit has left venezuela with a power vacuum and no obvious long-term leader.
