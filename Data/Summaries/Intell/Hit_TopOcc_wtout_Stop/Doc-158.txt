introducing the currency board system in 1991 obliged the central bank to guarantee the pesos in circulation with foreign currency reserves, in the same way as issuing bodies used to only issue notes to the equivalent of the gold reserves they held. argentine pension funds have enjoyed interest rates as high as 35 percent over recent months: no less than 45 percent of the national debt estimated at between $130 and $150 billion is held by the argentines themselves. over recent weeks street demonstrations culminating in the general strike of 13 december have been the most visible aspect of a civil war between creditors and debtors. appeals were already made to the creditors during the first phase of the debt rescheduling involving the $55 billion held by argentine funds and that was completed at the end of november. at the same time private debtors who became indebted in a strong currency would find themselves ruined by a peso devaluation. the final switch to the dollar would stabilize relations between creditors and debtors. but neither dollarization nor the currency board provides a guarantee of low interest rates, as there will always be an argentine risk.
