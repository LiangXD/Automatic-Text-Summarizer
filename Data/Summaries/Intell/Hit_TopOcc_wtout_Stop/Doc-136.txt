the conference in new york, which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms, and the genoa conference which had a much wider and extended agenda, had two common features between them. american delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale, possession, and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [as published] of american citizens, and equal to reducing their margin of security. critics of the meeting, on the margin of the conference, up held the view that the american government, instead of heeding the wishes of international community, and protecting the security of world nations, and above all the safety of its own citizens, has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military-industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments. the governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda, including: economic globalization, the anti-missile shield defense project, the kyoto protocol and environmental protection, the political and military crises in the middle east, the balkans, and afghanistan, moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries, and... [as published] it can safely be claimed that the events in genoa have influenced [overshadowed] the very conferences in new york and bonn whereas, from the onset, the weak results of genoa was foreseeable for most observers. bonn conference, america had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [as published] [controversial] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the kyoto protocol. to recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of new york and genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely.
