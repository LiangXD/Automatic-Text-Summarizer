washington's kid glove treatment of its so-called allies such as saudi arabia and pakistan came up for withering scrutiny at a briefing to release the 2001 country reports on human rights practices, an annual administrative exercise mandated by the congress that many feel has increasingly become a meaningless ritual. with the demise of the taliban, there is arguably no government in the world that has as bad a human rights record as saudi arabia does. what is the united states doing to actively promote democracy and human rights with saudi arabia? craner: we are talking to the saudi government about how to do that, and we are going to encourage others in the muslim world, in the arab world, who are trying to make their societies more democratic. and when you say we're talking to the government of saudi arabia, are we talking to them about starting such programs up, or are we just simply mentioning that they have a human rights problem? q: because other administrations told us that they've talked to the saudis about human rights and democracy issues, participation in women's rights and all of it. you talk about what we're doing tangibly in every other country but saudi arabia.
