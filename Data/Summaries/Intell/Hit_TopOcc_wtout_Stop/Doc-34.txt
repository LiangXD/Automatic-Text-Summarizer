gems are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital. gems are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital. the gene is very uncommon in nature so any intense yellow colonies of bacteria isolated from the wild ? and cultured ? are almost certainly the lost gems. this research , to enable identification of a released gem ? and its whereabouts ? is essential because_of the risks involved in letting gems out_of the laboratory. engineering a time delayed & bquo lethal gene & equo into a gem to give it a finite life ? making it sensitive to low air temperatures so that frost kills it ? is one way. doubling up on & bquo lethal genes & equo ? by making a gem both frost susceptible and ultraviolet light sensitive ? is a belt and braces approach. reporting to the house of commons , he said : & bquo agreement was reached on a directive concerning the deliberate release ? of genetically modified organisms.
