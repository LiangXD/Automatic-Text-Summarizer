san francisco 1996-08-20 levi strauss & co. said tuesday it was launching a line of slacks meant to appeal to men who do_ n't like suits , in only the third major brand introduction in the company's 140-year history. the new slacks , to be called slates , will be marketed as dressier than the company's famous jeans or its dockers pants brand , but not as formal as suits. the pants , to be aimed at men in their 30s and 40s who grew up wearing levi's jeans and dockers khakis , are meant to give a big boost to the san francisco-based clothing company , though how well men accept the new line remains to be seen , industry analysts said. _ we_ 're going to awaken a sleeping giant of a category that we think has enormous potential , _ jann westfall , president of the slates brand , said in a statement. those men want something different to wear as the workplace gets more casual , _ a new look for business and social occasions that falls between casual cotton pants and suits , _ westfall said. cogan said research revealed that men hate to shop for dress pants and believe _ it_ 's more enjoyable to go to the dentist _ because they ca_ n't find what they need or like. he said that levi strauss is trying to expand its business by going after the $1.9 billion-a-year market , but he does_ n't see it as a _ great growth engine _ for the company. in a national telephone survey of men in their 30s and 40s , almost half of men who do not work in jeans or a uniform said their office dress code is somewhere between suits and cotton pants , according_to levi strauss.
