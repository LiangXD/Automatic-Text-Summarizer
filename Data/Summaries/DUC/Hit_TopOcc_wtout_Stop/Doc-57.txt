president bill clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within the next 10 days to reform the us social safety net of welfare programmes. the president said he would focus on better implementation of the family support act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an nga task-force which he, as governor of arkansas, co-chaired. advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the new administration's intentions, fearing that the centrist democratic emphasis on requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fall prey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding of existing programmes. these suspicions were enhanced when ms donna shalala, new secretary of health and human services, last month devoted only one sentence to welfare reform in a five-page statement of goals. as a result, few states have been able to implement in full the act's requirement that welfare recipients take part in some form of education or training. mr clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principle that 'welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life'. many states have already embarked on far-reaching welfare reform programmes, such as michigan's 21-point plan to strengthen families or new jersey's family development programme.
