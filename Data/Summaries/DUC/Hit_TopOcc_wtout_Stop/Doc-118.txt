liz taylor's latest bout with pneumonia has drawn the kind of intense scrutiny normally accorded presidential polyps. it was partly to still the gossips that taylor's doctors called a press conference wednesday at st. john's hospital and medical center in santa monica. and when taylor's publicists first issued flat denials, the press went on to speculate about the speculation. behind a chorus line of video cameras -- representing the major networks, the local stations, cnn and the tabloid shows -- reporters peppered the doctors with pointed and sometimes testy questions about taylor's treatment and drug use. her addictions have even been linked to a criminal investigation by the los angeles county district attorney's office last week, prosecutors announced that no charges would be filed against taylor's doctors, who had been accused of over-prescribing dependence-forming drugs. taylor, the first celebrity known to enter the betty ford clinic in rancho mirage, made a public example of her willingness to take on her addictions in two heavily publicized stays there. taylor regained much of the weight, even though she took her drug problems in hand once again in a second stay at the betty ford clinic in 1988.
