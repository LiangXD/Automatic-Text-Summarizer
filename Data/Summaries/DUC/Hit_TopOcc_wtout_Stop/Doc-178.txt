hurricane joan's 80 mph winds churned across the open caribbean today on an unusual southern path that has forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible landfall. at noon edt today, joan's center was near latitude 11.1 north and longitude 76.3 west, about 70 miles west of the colombian coast and about 380 miles east of the island of san andres off the coast of nicaragua. panama issued a hurricane watch for its north coast, and colombia issued a hurricane watch for san andres, which is part of colombia even though it is located close to nicaragua. as a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, joan slowly built its strength as it skimmed colombia's coast, baffling forecasters who had predicted it to weaken. it reached hurricane force monday night and its center began to become better defined, a sign the system could intensify over open water into the western caribbean, forecasters said. also, he said hurricanes are often sapped of strength in the far southern caribbean due to trade winds that push colder deep-ocean water to the surface, said gross. joan became the 10th named storm of the 1988 atlantic hurricane season when top winds passed 39 mph on oct.
