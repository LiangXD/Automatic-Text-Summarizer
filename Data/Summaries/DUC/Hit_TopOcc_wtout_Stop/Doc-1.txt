the suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement. the government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in june 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans. 9, the ministry of agriculture, fisheries and food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with bse. because of the disease, the u.s. department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from great britain in july, said margaret webb, a usda spokeswoman in washington. david maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of "bse hysteria" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is "remote." "it is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of bse on human health," a consultative committee reported to the agriculture ministry. the committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that bse was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.
