meeting this week in washington, the governors said they want to transform the current welfare system -- largely an income-maintenance system -- into more of a job-support system. bill clinton of arkansas, even backed off earlier criticism of the administration's welfare plan, saying after the white house meeting, i feel better about the prospects of welfare reform than i did yesterday. one item on the governors' agenda that mr. reagan didn't go for was a national minimum level for an individual recipients's welfare benefits. the most unattractive feature of the governors' welfare plan is its price tag -- up to $2 billion a year on top of the $100 billion-plus already devoted to assorted anti-poverty programs. most important, the governors would require that welfare recipients do something productive in exchange for their benefits, be it completing school, receiving vocational training or holding a job. all the important players -- the president, the governors and congressional leaders -- agree that the goal of such reform is to transform the welfare system into one that enables poor families to achieve, in the president's words, real and lasting emancipation from welfare dependency. since all of the principals agree on the ultimate goal of welfare reform, it seems reasonable to expect that they can achieve a plan of action.
