one letter writer who also knows something about the constitution, though disagreeing with me on another point, agreed on the central issue, that regulation of gun ownership and use does not violate the constitution. all the letters missed entirely my point about requiring gun owners to sign up with (not join ) the national guard. requiring gun owners to register with the national guard would provide the kind of scrutiny the brady and staggers bills contemplated, and, if congress dared, could provide an additional measure of control over who owns what kinds of weapons. but my main point was to show how far congress can go in gun-control legislation without exceeding its constitutional powers, using as a model the legislation of the second congress, which included most of the authors of the second amendment. another letter writer thinks i have confused the issue by calling the duty to serve in the militia a right to serve, but if he will look at the debates in the first congress he will see that there is no confusion at all, that the authors of the second amendment were talking about the right to serve. the real issue is that the second amendment addressed a serious public concern, to protect the right of citizens to serve as defenders of the community in times of peril, not the personal uses of guns. and since the proliferation of guns in the hands of criminals has become a national calamity, as police officials all over the nation attest, it is essential that we recapture the true purpose of the second amendment.
