lima -- on june 4, i was among a group of journalists who were told that the war against the shining path ( sendero luminoso ) guerrillas had almost been won. nevertheless, it was a very important and unexpected police coup against the shining path -- one that probably could have brought dramatic results if president alan garcia had not decided to make public the operation so soon after the first police intervention, in order to score a quick propaganda gain. this impulsiveness gave full warning to the guerrillas' entire clandestine apparatus, allowing them to limit considerably the damage inflicted on them. </lp> <text> as alberto fujimori prepares to take over as peru's next president on july 28, the question of whether the shining path will hound his administration as it has the previous two ranks high among his concerns. midpoint during his term, mr. garcia lost all hope of defeating the shining path, and decided just to coexist with it, says rafael merino, a respected analyst on security matters. according to francisco loayza, mr. fujimori's adviser on internal-security matters, military actions against the shining path should be subordinated to economic-development initiatives. {the military} should mainly provide security for development projects, mr. loayza says. mr. loayza says that president garcia's approach failed because of corruption and ineptitude. this is only wishful thinking, according to mr. merino: if president fujimori thinks he'll finish the war through those 'pacification' policies, it will be like riding into battle with no better dress or weapons than a tuxedo.
