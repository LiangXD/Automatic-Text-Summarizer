gunmen seized the 42-year-old anderson in moslem west beirut after a game of tennis that had been a brief respite from his reporting on lebanon's civil war. police say lebanese authorities have no information on the whereabouts of anderson or the 15 other western hostages in lebanon. four days ago, islamic jihad made its first statement in a year, reviving an old offer to trade anderson and sutherland for their comrades jailed in kuwait. a copy of the statement delivered to a western news agency in beirut was accompanied by a photograph of anderson similar to one released nov. the statement was seen as a response to a declaration monday by president hashemi rafsanjani of iran that he would use its influence to free the hostages if the united states released iranian assets worth up to $12 billion that have been frozen since 1979. islamic jihad issued its statement as the leader of iran's revolutionary radicals, former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi, was on a three-week visit to lebanon. anderson knows his daughter, sulome, was born june 7, 1985, but has seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed him to watch on lebanese tv, according to letters from him released by the kidnappers.
