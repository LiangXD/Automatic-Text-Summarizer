confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, de beers consolidated mines ltd., the south african concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving. de beers managed the comeback by convincing diamond producers, dealers and the jewelry industry that its marketing muscle was indispensable. selling diamonds is the business of dealers and jewelers helping them to sell more is ours, says stephen lussier, a de beers marketing executive. de beers's central selling organization, known as the syndicate, is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in antwerp, belgium bombay, india tel aviv, israel, and new york. de beers can't stop evolution, says jack lunzer, chairman of idc holdings ltd., a london-based diamond firm that sells diamonds for guinea, an african nation that isn't a cartel member. while average prices of de beers's rough diamonds rose 37%, prices of polished diamonds in dealers' stocks collapsed. in a series of shrewd moves, de beers forced zaire to rejoin the cartel by dumping diamonds.
