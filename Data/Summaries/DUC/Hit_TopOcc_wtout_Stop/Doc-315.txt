by many estimates, milken probably achieved that milestone, because by the age of 30 he was a fast-rising star at the fast-rising securities firm of drexel burnham lambert inc., managing its high-yield junk bond operations and reaping huge profits for the firm and himself. milken virtually single-handedly pioneered the modern junk bond market, now worth $180 billion in total bonds outstanding, and the fuel that has financed hundreds of small- and middle-size businesses and wave after wave of corporate takeovers. while milken's junk bonds helped companies create thousands of new jobs, they also led to layoffs of workers at firms taken over by raiders financed by junk bonds. milken's shrewd trading of junk bonds soon began making millions of dollars for drexel -- and for himself and his band of hard-working traders and salesmen. he and drexel began underwriting new junk bonds, issued by companies that were too small, young or risky to get conventional bank loans or issue conventional high-rated corporate bonds. milken viewed the issuance of junk bonds by small- and medium-size companies as part of a crusade to change the face of corporate america. drexel and milken defenders say such practices were necessary to maintain orderly markets in junk bonds where there were few buyers and sellers anyway.
