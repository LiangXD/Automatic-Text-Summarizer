term limits would accomplish few of their proponents' goals -- more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists. a powerful antidote would be to limit committee service, which would have few of the political and constitutional drawbacks of term limits. while both men are deeply dismayed at the current state of congress, they see term limits as a cure worse than the illness. term limits really hit at democracy, says prof. fenno. this really would challenge these guys to shake up the system, says mr. fenno, noting that the power of interest groups is centered in committees. mr. ferris believes this would put a vitality in the system while not resulting, unlike overall term limits, in a bunch of neophytes who'd be more dependent on staff and lobbyists. mr. ferris notes that the current system, in which a lawmaker gets a cherished committee assignment in his first or second term and then stays there for the rest of his tenure, breeds staleness.
