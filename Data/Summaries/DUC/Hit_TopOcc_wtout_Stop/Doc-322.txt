milken took it too far by insisting that junk bonds -- securities that carry high risks and high interest rates -- were suitable for everyone. making junk mainstream is what did milken in -- and ultimately what did in the junk bond market. once other brokerage houses decided to go after the junk business, milken's competitive juices -- and his obsession with controlling every aspect of everything in his life -- compelled him to do whatever sleazy things it took to nail down business. if junk had stayed a backwater -- and if either the enforcers at the securities and exchange commission or milken's alleged superiors at drexel burnham lambert reined milken in -- he wouldn't be going to jail. to understand milken, you have to understand that when he wandered into the world of junk bonds at a third-rate philadelphia brokerage house in the 1970s, the junk market consisted of a handful of canny investors who spent their days searching through the rubble of financially distressed companies searching for securities that were better than they looked. this meant that when early junkmeisters -- saul p. steinberg of reliance insurance, laurence a. tisch of loews, carl lindner of penn central and american financial, to name a few -- wanted to buy or sell junk, they had to deal with milken. but as the market for junk grew larger -- mainly because of what michael was doing -- milken wanted to keep all the business.
