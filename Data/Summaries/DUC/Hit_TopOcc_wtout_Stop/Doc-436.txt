testifying in mr. keating's court challenge to the takeover, mr. seibold said lots of documents -- loan and credit files -- were missing when an fdic team swept through lincoln's offices in phoenix, ariz., april 14, 1989. he said that over the next several days, the fdic managed to retrieve the documents from lincoln officials -- in exchange for giving the officials some of the art that decorated lincoln's offices. but during a break in the trial, mr. keating said the suggestion that there was any bartering to get documents back was ridiculous. meanwhile, mr. keating asked the regulators to return to him a painting, which hung in lincoln's offices and was given to him by his nephew. mr. keating also said that lincoln was required to keep all original loan files at its headquarters in irvine, calif. mr. seibold wouldn't speak to reporters about mr. keating's version of the events. henry gonzalez, who made mr. keating something of a celebrity with his hearings on lincoln last year, called for the justice department to freeze the assets of mr. keating and other highflyers who have defrauded savings and loans.
