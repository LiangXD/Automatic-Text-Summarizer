the reagan administration may be willing to relax its opposition to an increase in the minimum wage if congress agrees to dilute the legislation significantly, labor secretary william brock indicated. mr. brock said in an interview that exemptions from the minimum wage would be necessary for youths who lack entry-level job skills and for small businesses. earlier this week, during the senate labor committee's first hearing on a bill to boost the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour in 1990 from the current $3.35, mr. brock reiterated his opposition to an increase. in yesterday's interview, the secretary suggested the administration might accept a higher minimum wage, though perhaps smaller than in the pending bill, if congress makes certain changes in the measure. mr. brock's suggestions for modifying the minimum-wage bill aren't likely to receive a warm welcome from congressional advocates for raising the minimum. many people feel that some kind of increase in the minimum wage is inevitable, he said, so an effort is afoot to see how congress can do as little harm... and as much good as possible, while boosting the wage level. some congressional labor experts said mr. brock personally would like to deal on capitol hill for a minimum-wage compromise.
