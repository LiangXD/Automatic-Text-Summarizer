a year behind schedule and five years in the making, biosphere 2 has forged ahead despite questions about its credibility, charges of cultism and accusations that leaders bullied departed consultants. the creation of billionaire oil mogul edward bass, biosphere 2 aims to study how people can live in an airtight world. but biosphere 2 has a structure that can be used and studied for 100 years. news reports since 1985 have linked the project's leaders to a 1970s commune where, some ex-commune members say, biosphere 2 executive john allen led a cult devoted to creating a new civilization. the fort worth star-telegram reported that one of allen's protege's was oilman bass, biosphere 2's main financier. several of biosphere 2's leaders have unaccredited degrees from the institute. there have been so many people with biosphere 2 who never had anything to do with john allen 20 years ago.
