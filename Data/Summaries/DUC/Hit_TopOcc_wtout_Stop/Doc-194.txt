with a third presidential candidate assassinated, colombia's government refused friday to put off next month's election and vowed to keep up the fight against drug traffickers. a telefaxed communique, purportedly from the medellin drug cartel, denied responsibility friday for the assassination of presidential candidate carlos pizarro, who died in a hail of bullets thursday aboard a colombian jetliner carrying 97 people. but on thursday, within hours of pizarro's assassination, a man had called the national radio network station caracol and related in detail how the cartel had allegedly ordered the former guerrilla's killing. friday's telefax accused police of instigating violence in order to force the government to continue its crackdown on traffickers, and accused the police of putting out false communiques purported to be from the cartel. since then, drug traffickers have killed more than 230 people, including judges, politicians, policemen, soldiers, newspaper employees and two other presidential candidates. leaders of the leftist patriotic union party, whose candidate was slain last month, urged the government to cancel the may 27 vote. governing party candidate cesar gaviria, the presidential front-runner, suspended campaign activities following the pizarro killing.
