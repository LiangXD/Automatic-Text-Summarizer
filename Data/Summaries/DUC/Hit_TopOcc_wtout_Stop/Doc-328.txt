washington -- embattled white house chief of staff john sununu, fighting for his political survival, has a rare bit of good news: while americans generally don't approve of his actions, most don't think he should resign. in a new wall street journal/nbc news poll, voters were asked whether charges of inappropriate use of government and corporate transportation by mr. sununu are so serious that he should resign. though president bush says mr. sununu's job is safe for now, the ruckus over the chief of staff's extensive use of government and corporate jets and cars has brought to the surface a host of sununu enemies who are likely to keep gunning for his demise. and while voters aren't clamoring for mr. sununu's head, they have formed a more negative impression of him. they canvassed 1,006 registered voters by telephone from last saturday through tuesday, a period when the latest flap over mr. sununu's failure to inform the white house counsel's office accurately about the procurement of a corporate jet he used to attend a chicago fund-raiser was in full swing. the poll's findings are likely to fuel arguments by mr. sununu's supporters that the controversy over his travel isn't being taken as seriously in the country at large as it is inside washington. mr. sununu admitted that he made mistakes in using government planes and his white house car for personal and political business, and he has adopted a low profile.
