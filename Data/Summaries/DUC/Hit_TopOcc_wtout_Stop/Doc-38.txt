the eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of tuxpan, on mexico's west coast. firm estimates aren't available, but blotted-out-sun watchers are expected to number more than 100,000 -- perhaps 50,000 to 70,000 in hawaii and an equal number in baja. the effect of it -- the view of seeing the sun disappear little by little and then actually having the (blue) sky disappear and having the birds stop singing -- it's miraculous, said irving hochman, a member of the san francisco amateur astronomers. it's romantic images like these that are inspiring a last-minute surge of would-be eclipse-watchers, travel agents say. learning of the eclipse only a month ago, they began calling travel agents. but after enveloping the big island and then slicing across southern baja, the moon's shadow will cross the gulf of california and race across the southern flank of mexico and down the west coast of central america. with the eclipse, there's concern the overbooking could be particularly bad, especially on inter-island flights in hawaii.
