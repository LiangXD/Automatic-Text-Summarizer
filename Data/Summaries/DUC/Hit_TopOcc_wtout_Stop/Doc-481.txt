president bush today renewed his threat to veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond $4.25 an hour as senate democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage floor to $4.55. edward m. kennedy, d-mass., would raise the hourly minimum from $3.35 to $4.65 by january 1992 and contains no provision allowing a lower wage for new workers. but kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his measure identical to the house bill passed two weeks ago, which has a final wage of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants in the job market a "sub-minimum" for two months. while the house-passed bill cuts the final target of the hourly minimum wage to $4.55, it moves up the effective dates of the three increases from jan. the president said his support for those increases hinges on a provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for six months regardless of any past experience with another employer. the sub-minimum, under the bush plan, would be $3.35 an hour after the first increase in the minimum wage. 1. when the subsequent increases in the minimum wage took effect the sub-minimum would rise as well, to 85 percent of the minimum.
