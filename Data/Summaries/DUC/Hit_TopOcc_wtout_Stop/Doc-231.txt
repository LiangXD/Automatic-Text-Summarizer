the jwaneng mine, on the fringes of the kalahari desert in botswana, is known as 'a gem in the world of gems' because it almost certainly is the richest diamond mine in the world - at least in terms of the value of the stones it yields. all this goes to show that de beers, the south african group that dominates world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, still has complete faith in its ability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short-term difficulties such as those the company is experiencing with russia. the south african group believes that its control of at least 50 per cent of world diamond production gives it a powerful base from which to negotiate with the other producers who have marketing contracts with de beers' central selling organisation, in botswana de beers controls half of debswana, the company that owns the jwaneng mine, with the government owning the rest. mr derrick moore, the general manager, says this indicates mining in the open pit will last another 35 years - 'and then we might go underground'. if experience at de beers' wholly-owned finsch mine in south africa is anything to go by, planning the underground development at jwaneng might already have started. however, mr mark button, mining superintendent, says: 'finsch has come of age as an underground mine after two years. mr webb says the objective is to mine down to a depth of 830 metres, at which point there are not enough diamonds left in the ground to make recovery viable.
