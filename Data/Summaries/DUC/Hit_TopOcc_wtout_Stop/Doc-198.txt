a few days ago, palestinian ahmad mahmud 'abd-al-karim, a prominent frc official, arrived in lebanon from finland on the special mission of following up the investigations the lebanese authorities are conducting with the palestinians from the abu-nidal group who are accused of the assassination of jordanian first secretary na'ib al-ma'ayitah in beirut on 29 january. reports mention that the first steps in the investigation have revealed that the frc planned and carried out the assassination in coordination with the jordanian fundamentalist islamic mobilization youth organization [imyo] which is financed by iran. the security information the investigators have collected on the al-ma'ayitah assassination shows that as soon as the imyo was exposed, jordanian fundamentalist elements belonging to various organizations such as muhammad's army, the islamic liberation army, and the imyo and others moved to neighboring arab countries. iran managed to recruit frc members to work in the jordanian fundamentalist extremist organizations by taking advantage of the hostility the abu-nidal group has harbored against jordan and its regime and king ever since the group was expelled from the country. but why did the abu-nidal group and the imyo choose to assassinate na'ib al-ma'ayitah and not any other jordanian official in the beirut embassy. jordanian security officials traveled to lebanon and cooperated with lebanese officers in the investigations that led to revealing all the details and the arrest of more than 30 members of abu-nidal group in jordan. it also hastened to send one of its officials to lebanon to follow the investigation and try to lessen its repercussions out of fear that al-ma'ayitah's assassination may be one of the fatal mistakes committed by the frc and may negatively affect the organization's future in lebanon and jordan.
