a naval commander who had observed the uss vincennes in the persian gulf said the ship had "no good reason" for shooting down an iranian civilian airliner, killing all 290 aboard. david r. carlson in the u.s. naval institute proceedings magazine this month said others had remarked on the agressive behavior of the vincennes, which had been dubbed "robo cruiser." carlson, commander of the uss sides, a frigate that was on the scene when the uss vincennes shot down the airbus on july 3, 1988, clearly put the blame on actions taken by the ship and disputed any notion of self-defense. will rogers, skipper of the vincennes at the time, said carlson's assessment was subjective and not in line with the navy's conclusions. "commander carlson's comments in the magazine article are his personal opinions of the airbus incident," he said. according to carlson, the event started with the vincennes' helicopter drawing fire from iranian speedboats, which he claims were only warning shots. william m. fogarty, who headed the navy's investigating team, said the captain of the vincennes, will rogers iii, ordered the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken belief the airliner was an iranian f-14 fighter plane.
