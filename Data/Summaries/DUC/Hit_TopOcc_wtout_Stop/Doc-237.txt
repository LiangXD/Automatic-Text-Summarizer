agreement by the administration is expected to bring mr torres and at least 7 other hispanic congressmen into the pro-nafta fold. the administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-nafta votes, out of the 218 needed. it is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants a reason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it is pushing feverishly to turn anti-nafta public opinion around. the white house 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110 republicans in favour, 65-75 democrats in favour and 20-30 leaning towards it. the pro-nafta campaign this week began moving into high gear. president bill clinton on wednesday gave his second impassioned speech on nafta at an exhibit on the white house lawn of products likely to benefit from nafta. across town, the afl-cio trade union grouping on wednesday had its own products exhibit, but those were likely to be hurt by nafta.
