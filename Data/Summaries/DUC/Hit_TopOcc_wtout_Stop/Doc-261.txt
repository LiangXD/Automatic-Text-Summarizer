but the guerrillas have discovered they can easily win support among farmers in the jungles of upper huallaga because of widespread anger generated by the u.s.-financed peruvian anti-drug campaign. one reason is embarrassment that the u.s.-financed anti-drug effort may have pushed coca growers closer to the guerrillas. government officials from the anti-drug police (umopar) and the coca-eradication unit (corah) sent into the region to wipe out drug production were often confined to their barracks by the army they simply were not allowed to carry on with their work. the army continued its raids against the shining path in one part of the valley, but the drug growers were increasing production in several other parts while anti-drug officials were virtually kept under lock and key. anti-drug police, upper huallaga residents and interior ministry officials report that army officers received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs from drug lords for their help in keeping anti-drug officials at bay. the commander of the anti-drug police, gen. juan zarate, says there are few guerrillas in the upper huallaga and denies that an alliance exists between the drug traffickers and the shining path. the government's problem in combatting the current violence and influence of the shining path is how to ensure that army troops sent into this coca-rich region won't become corrupted by the lure of drug money, as they reportedly did in the past.
