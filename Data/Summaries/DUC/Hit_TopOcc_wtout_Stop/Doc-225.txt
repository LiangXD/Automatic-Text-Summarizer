this is the central selling organization, london-based marketing arm of the de beers diamond empire, controlled by the wealthy oppenheimer family of south africa. de beers' south african interests face an uncertain future, largely because of a newly energized political will by the black majority in that country, an important diamond producer. the government of newly independent namibia, meanwhile, is expected to demand a one-fifth stake in consolidated diamond mines, de beers' namibian subsidiary. jack lunzer, managing director of idc ltd., an independent diamond distributor in london, said de beers undoubtedly will continue to control the major part of world production, but its marketing arm's profits will fall. the organization buys rough diamonds from de beers' own mines, which represent 30 percent of world production, and from producers in tanzania, south africa, zaire, botswana, namibia, australia and the soviet union. de beers insists it seeks long-term stability and prosperity for the industry, saying price fluctuations would undermine confidence in the value of diamonds. sir ernest oppenheimer, a diamond merchant, became chairman of de beers in 1929 and five years later formed diamond trading co., the precursor of today's cartel.
