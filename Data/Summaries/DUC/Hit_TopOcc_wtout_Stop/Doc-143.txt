on one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries. on the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as bank of boston decided monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible. it's a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out, says lawrence cohn, an analyst at merrill lynch &amp co. the bank of boston decision may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks, adds james j. mcdermott, jr., director of research at keefe bruyette &amp woods inc., a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks. actions such as that taken by bank of boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money-center banks. while the large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as bank of boston, they also want to ensure that the regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations. in order to take steps similar to bank of boston's, large money-center banks would have to sell assets, shrink balance sheets and slash dividends -- and they show little sign of doing that. along with $330 million in such loans previously put on non-accrual, bank of boston has now either charged off, or put on non-accrual, all of its $1 billion loans to heavily indebted developing countries.
