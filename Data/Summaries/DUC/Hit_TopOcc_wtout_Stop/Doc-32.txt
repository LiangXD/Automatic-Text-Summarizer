the spotlight that had been trained on the police department and its 8,300 officers now has widened to take in the equally large sheriff's department. the king beating led to an investigation of the police department by an independent commission that found racism, brutality, inadequate discipline, mismanagement and a siege mentality pitting officers against the community. but block has dug in his heels, insisting a panel he appointed is independent enough to advise which christopher commission recommendations might apply to his department. like gates before him, block maintains his department is a good one with a reputation as being one of the most progressive, one of the most professional, one of the finest law enforcement agencies. 'a last-resort mechanism' law enforcement, and i'm going beyond the sheriff's department, did not create the social conditions out there from which the violence is springing, he said. police brutality (or) racism is not a social problem, it's a law enforcement lack of leadership, the hoover institution's mcnamara said. on the county side, critics say block's position as an elected official insulates him from the kind of independent review the city was able to order for the police department.
