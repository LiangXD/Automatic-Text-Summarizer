since congress stopped raising the federal minimum wage in 1981, the u.s. economy has generated nine million new jobs at all salary levels. some of those new jobs wouldn't be there if congress had continued to dictate a minimum level of wages. yet organized labor, which constantly asserts its interest in job creation, has made a strong pitch for the kennedy-hawkins minimum wage restoration act, a bill that would head the minimum wage upward once more. in reality, a minimum wage prices the weakest members of the work force out of jobs. at any rate, a study commission appointed by jimmy carter estimated in a 1981 report that every 10% increase in the minimum wage cost the economy 80,000 to 200,000 entry-level jobs. senator dan quayle, a republican, has calculated that two democratic projects, the minimum-wage increase proposed for 1989 and mandatory health coverage, would add $1.49 an hour more to wage costs at the bottom of the income scale. the absence of the minimum-wage constraint on the ability of these extra earners to find jobs has relieved poverty, not increased it.
