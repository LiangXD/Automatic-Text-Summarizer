wildland firefighters, whose only protection is the cotton bandanna covering their faces, lose as much as 10% of their lung capacity after one routine season, and the damage persists for weeks, according to the studies by the california department of health services and the johns hopkins university school of hygiene and public health in baltimore. but the u.s. forest service and state and county fire officials have been unable to protect their wildfire crews because they know of no gear light enough for firefighters to wear while hiking miles in burning terrain or effective enough to filter out the wide variety of toxic materials in smoke. the johns hopkins tests, conducted on 52 northern california wildland firefighters during the 1988 season, showed that their lung function -- or flow of oxygen -- remained reduced by as much as 3% even eight weeks after exposure. the california health department's tests on 63 firefighters showed they lost as much as 10% of their lung capacity during one six-month fire season, with an average loss of 4%. during the four months of fires in 1988 at yellowstone national park, 12,000 firefighters sought medical aid for respiratory problems, and about 600 needed a doctor's care after returning home, a u.s. forest service report says. although the findings of the national studies have not yet been published, word has spread to top officials in the state forestry department, who say they are now starting to search for protection for the agency's 3,500 full-time firefighters and about 2,000 seasonal ones. the protection: bandanna: wild-land firefighters wear nothing but a thin cloth on their face to protect their lungs from smoke.
