the los angeles county district attorney's office and the fbi are investigating a videotaped incident in which a white long beach police officer appeared to shove a black man's face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop. the long beach city council voted tuesday to ask the district attorney's office to launch an independent investigation of the saturday night incident, which was secretly recorded by an nbc television crew. the fbi has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the man who was arrested -- don jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the hawthorne police department -- were violated during his altercation with two long beach officers on pacific coast highway, spokesman fred reagan said. jackson and jeff hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, donned dirty old clothes and drove into long beach in a rented 12-year-old sedan saturday night as the television crew followed behind in a van. the two men said they wanted to demonstrate a long-standing problem of abuse of minority group members by long beach police officers. although long beach mayor ernie kell told nbc's today show on tuesday morning that the two police officers had been suspended, police chief lawrence l. binkley said that the officers, mark dickey and mark ramsey, will remain on duty at this stage of the investigation. he said the two police officers become concerned for their safety when jackson suspiciously exited the car as soon as it stopped, then immediately started arguing when dickey ordered him to submit to a search for weapons.
