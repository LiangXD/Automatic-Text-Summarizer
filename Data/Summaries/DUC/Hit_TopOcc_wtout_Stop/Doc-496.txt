gen. colin l. powell, who is expected to be named the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, is described by colleagues as a "soldier's soldier" who doesn't particularly like staff jobs. the 52-year-old son of jamaican immigrants, powell was highly regarded by president reagan, succeeding frank c. carlucci as reagan's national security adviser. on personal level, however, powell doesn't always keep up with the times. washington colleagues have described powell as a "soldier's soldier" who doesn't like staff jobs. carlucci says that powell has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that reagan got powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the general had turned carlucci down several times. on the job, powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he became forscom commander. as leader of powell is responsible for the training and preparedness of more than 1 million active, reserve and national guard troops in the united states.
