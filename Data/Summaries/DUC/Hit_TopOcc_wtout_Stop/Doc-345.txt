other bush administration officials said that the international naval force in the area -- consisting of american, british, french, canadian, soviet, german and australian ships -- may be used both to stop oil exports from leaving iraq and kuwait and to stop shipments of food and other goods from going in. the naval interdiction force is part of an overall american strategy that officials say is designed to leave the iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation. though they insist they aren't trying to lure saddam hussein into an attack, officials hope that if he strikes again, the u.s. and its allies will have such an impressive force in place in saudi arabia that they will be able to crush him in retaliation. so saddam hussein on friday tried to scare other arab leaders into supporting him by calling on arabs to rise up in a holy war against leaders who invited american and other western soldiers into saudi arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom. the saudis even have in their possession 48 kuwaiti jet fighters, virtually the entire kuwaiti air force, which managed to escape the iraqi invasion, saudi officials said. if iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition, the bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the american public and the west in general, and could open the possibility that moderate arabs -- even including saudi arabia -- might drop out of the effort against iraq and accept some deal from saddam hussein. the unpredictability of iraq's leader is a principal reason the u.s. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around saudi arabia.
