the nation's top military officer jumped into the pentagon budget battle friday, arguing that hasty cuts in military spending will end up "breaking the back" of america's defense. powell's blunt remarks were his first major commentary on the debate over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of lessened east-west tensions. a former national security adviser, powell now serves as the president's primary military counselor and coordinator of the nations' military leaders. "we must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the enduring realities we face," powell said. powell said defense secretary dick cheney's plan released earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five years shows "we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal." the administration budget blueprint, powell said, will begin to reduce the nation's forces over time. "on this glide path we will reach a base force which i believe is not prudent to go below if we wish to match enduring defense needs with enduring realities," powell said.
