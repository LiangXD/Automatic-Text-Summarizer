unfortunately, there is the second amendment to the constitution: a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. since the amendment's stated purpose is arming state militias, they reason, it creates no individual right to own a gun. but why leap to the conclusion that a broadly worded constitutional freedom ( the right of the people to keep and bear arms ) is narrowly limited by its stated purpose, unless you're trying to explain it away? a colleague says that if liberals interpreted the second amendment the way they interpret the rest of the bill of rights, there would be law professors arguing that gun ownership is mandatory. the phrase right of the people appears four other times in the bill of rights (including the first amendment). kates also marshals impressive historical evidence that the second amendment, like other bill of rights protections, was intended to incorporate english common law rights of the time, which pretty clearly included the right to keep a gun in your home for reasons having nothing to do with the militia. working from that decision and the common law, kates says the amendment's protection should be limited to weapons in common use among law-abiding people, useful for law enforcement or personal defense, and lineally descended from weapons known to the framers.
