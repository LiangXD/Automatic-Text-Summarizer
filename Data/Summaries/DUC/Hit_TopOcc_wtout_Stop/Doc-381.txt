beginning in december, most private employers will be barred by law from using polygraphs and other types of lie detectors to screen job applicants or test the current employees except in rare circumstances. under new regulations issued friday by the labor department, employers can be fined up to $10,000 for requiring a job seeker or employee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph exam for voice stress analysis. some 7.2 million employers nationwide will be required to put up posters in december summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions and outlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detector test. in addition to the fines, anyone required to take the test in violation of the new law can sue employers in federal and state courts for relief, such as employment reinstatement, promotion and any payment of lost wages and benefits. pharmaceutical concerns or companies manufacturing, distributing or dispensing controlled substances also can require job applicants to submit to a lie detector test, but only for those people who would have direct access to the drugs. but any workers asked to submit to a polygraph exam under those conditions must be given at least 48 hours advance notice and a statement in advance telling them of their rights, including the right to refuse the test or to terminate it at any time. results of a polygraph test or refusal to submit to such an exam cannot be used alone as a basis for taking any action against an employee.
