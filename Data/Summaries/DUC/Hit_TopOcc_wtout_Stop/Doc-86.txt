a 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in newark, n.j., has caught the attention of health officials, who had been previously recording with satisfaction a slow, steady decrease in tb cases over the last few decades. they attribute the 5 percent national increase in tb cases in 1989 to the ravages of the aids virus, which destroys the body's immune system and leaves victims open to tb infection, dr. philip c. hopewell of san francisco general hospital said sunday. about 4 percent of americans identified as having the aids virus also have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis, said dr. dixie e. snider jr., director of the division of tuberculosis control at the centers for disease control in atlanta. snider stressed that tuberculosis, unlike aids, is a curable disease and called for tb screenings at drug rehabilitation programs, prisons or other places where aids tests are being administered. in wyoming, the centers for disease control recorded no new cases of tb in 1989, demonstrating that it is a condition that can be controlled and cured, according to dr. lee b. reichman, director of the pulmonary division of the university of medicine and dentistry in new jersey. snider said 10 million to 15 million americans have been infected with the tuberculosis germ, but only a small percentage of them develop the disease because their immune system was strong enough to prevent the disease from developing. reichman noted that most american have forgotten about the problems of tb from 1981 to 1984, tb cases declined an average of 6 percent per year according to the centers for disease control.
