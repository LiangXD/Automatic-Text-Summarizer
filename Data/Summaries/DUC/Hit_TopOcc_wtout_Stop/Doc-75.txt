a top west german military official said saturday that the fiery crash of a u.s. air force jet that killed six people will further erode popular support for national defense programs. a u.s. air force a-10 thunderbolt ii jet tore a swath of destruction through a working-class neighborhood in the central west german city of remscheid. in an interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper, the inspector general of west germany's military said the crash was certain to have a serious impact on already sinking public support for defense issues. "i am alarmed that many west germans have lost sight of the hard facts (of defense realities) in their hopes for continued peace," which hinge on west germany's and nato's security preparedness, he said. west germany's skies are crowded with hundreds of jets and helicopters each day. even before thursday's fatal crash, 12 major accidents of military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone. the u.s. air force said in a statement saturday that the pilot of the a-10 "inadvertently flew into clouds" while attempting to join in close formation with another aircraft.
