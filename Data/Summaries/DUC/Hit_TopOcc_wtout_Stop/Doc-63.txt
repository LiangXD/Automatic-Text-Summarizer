howard metzenbaum, d-ohio, said the senate judiciary committee, in confirming four justices without learning how they felt about abortion, has given them a free ride and should be tougher in ferreting out thomas' views. i will not support yet another reagan-bush supreme court nominee who remains silent on a woman's right to choose, and then ascends to the court to weaken that right, said metzenbaum, the only member of the judiciary committee who voted against thomas' nomination to the circuit court of appeals to the district of columbia. the background of judge clarence thomas is less important than his views and what they mean to protecting our constitutional rights, said sen. when head of the eeoc during the reagan administration, thomas seemed to go out of his way to find ways to weaken some of the basic civil rights protections, said simon, a member of the senate judiciary committee. now that president bush has nominated clarence thomas to the supreme court, the next step is up to the senate. (box)the senate judiciary committee is expected to begin confirmation hearings in september, after the august recess. (box)after the committee makes a recommendation, the nomination will be voted on by the full senate.
