in choosing federal judge robert bork for the supreme court, president reagan has tapped a leading architect of conservative legal theory -- and has ensured a tough confirmation battle in the senate. the selection of the 60-year-old judge bork to replace retiring justice lewis powell gives the president his third supreme court appointment and by far his greatest opportunity to alter the court's direction. but in judge bork, appointed by mr. reagan in 1982 to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia, the president has picked a rare judicial -- rather than a political -- conservative, a judge committed to a narrow role for the courts rather than to the reagan administration's political agenda. and liberal democrats on the senate judiciary committee, fearful that mr. reagan's choice may upset the supreme court's moderate balance, have made clear they will fight any candidate whose views about the constitution and the courts are too conservative. judge bork, widely regarded as the most prominent and intellectually powerful advocate of judicial restraint, shares my views that judges' personal preferences and values should not be part of their constitutional interpretations, mr. reagan said. committee democrats say they don't expect to start hearings until september, raising questions about whether judge bork would be approved by the supreme court's opening next oct. judge bork has been widely and sharply critical of the supreme court's 1964 decision establishing the principle of one person, one vote.
