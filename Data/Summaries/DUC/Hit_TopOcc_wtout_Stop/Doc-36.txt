scientists missed by 150 years in dating the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tablet that also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researchers said today. scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse, recorded on a clay tablet found in syria, occurred on may 3, 1375 b.c. but in today's issue of the british journal nature, two dutch scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened about 150 years later, on march 5, 1223 b.c. in addition, the text apparently indicates that mars was visible at the time of the eclipse, the dutch researchers said. they compared those criteria and the likely age range for the tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible from ugarit. they compared those criteria and the likely age range for the tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible from ugarit. even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed, it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, edwin krupp, director of the griffith observatory in los angeles, said in a telephone interview.
