that is why the american diabetes assn. and other health education groups in the los angeles area and california have begun a major push to educate latinos about diabetes. like heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among latinos is a condition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors say. latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are anglos, and incidence of the disease increases with age. most commonly in latinos, however, diabetes takes the form called type ii, which first appears in adulthood and often can be controlled with proper diet and exercise. for instance, the fact that type ii diabetes frequently shows up in women during or shortly after pregnancy gives health educators an ideal chance to influence an entire latino family's eating habits, said dr. martin montoro, co-director of the diabetes and pregnancy service at los angeles county-usc medical center. chief among these is that the latino patient is less likely to volunteer information or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the anglo patient, said dr. aliza lifshitz, a board member of the california hispanic american medical assn. davidson said he is confident that latinos will respond to education efforts on diabetes.
