the war in the former republics of yugoslavia is forcing slovene enterprises to find alternative trading partners among european community countries as a means of compensating for lost markets in the region. until 1990, over 30 per cent of slovenia's exports were with the former yugoslavia, while about 70 per cent were divided between comecon, the now defunct socialist trading block, and western european countries. but following an embargo by serbia on slovene imports in 1990, and ensuing war in neighbouring croatia last year, slovene exports to the former yugoslavia have fallen to 15 per cent of that previously. mr feri horvath, head of slovenia's chamber of commerce, said slovenia, which declared its independence last june, must seek new markets because the republic is too small to be able to attract large amounts of foreign investment to foster growth. renault, french car manufacturer, which assembles cars in slovenia, and siemens, german-based mechanical and electrical goods maker, which has a joint venture with iskra, slovenia's electronic and telecommunications manufacturer, have used slovenia as a base for exporting to other parts of yugoslavia, as well as to western europe. 'our enterprises are beginning to find new markets,' said mr horvath, adding that germany, italy, france and austria are now slovenia's main trading partners. mrs vojka ravbar, slovenia's deputy foreign minister, who earlier this week headed a trade delegation to the uk, said enterprises will have to become even more competitive after privatisation.
