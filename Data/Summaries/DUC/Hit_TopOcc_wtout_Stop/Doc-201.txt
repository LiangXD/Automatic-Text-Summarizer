if mr ernesto zedillo, mexico's next president, had any doubts about the difficulties of reforming mexico's governing party and the country's corrupt judicial and legal system, the assassination last week of mr jose francisco ruiz massieu, the party's number two official, will probably have removed them. mr ruiz massieu's killing was allegedly ordered by mr manuel munoz rocha, a federal deputy of the ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri), and mr abraham rubio canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to the gulf drug cartel in the state of tamaulipas. since mr ruiz massieu's assassination, there has been renewed speculation that political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the killing six months ago of mr luis donaldo colosio, the ruling party's reform-minded presidential candidate, even though no evidence has emerged to indicate this is the case. two newspapers reported yesterday that mr munoz rocha has admitted to a role in the crime but put the responsibility on mr rubio canales, who reportedly blames mr ruiz massieu for his conviction for fraud in 1992, and the prison sentence he is currently serving. government officials have suggested the gulf drug cartel may have deliberately involved mr munoz rocha in the assassination to maximise the political impact of the crime. one view is they believed the assassination would weaken mr ruiz massieu's brother, mario, who is the deputy attorney general in charge of drug enforcement. mr mario ruiz massieu recently had arrested raul valladares, top lieutenant in the gulf cartel and son-in-law of mr rubio canales, the man in the acapulco jail accused of jointly plotting the assassination.
