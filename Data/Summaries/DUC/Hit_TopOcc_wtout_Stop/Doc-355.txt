but it has offended some, especially in arab countries, who now believe that mr. bush's real objectives are the demise of saddam hussein and the destruction of the iraqi military, not just the liberation of kuwait. u.s. and kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from kuwait city are being rounded up and held by iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over. president bush's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton iraqi destruction inside kuwait. mr. bush and his aides were leaning toward a military conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of iraqi atrocities in kuwait came to light. u.s. commanders said 5,500 iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000. the u.s. hopes its troops will drive iraqi forces out of kuwait quickly, leaving much of iraq's offensive military equipment destroyed or abandoned in kuwait. yet, paradoxically, the perception that the u.s. wants to destroy iraq may increase saddam hussein's support within the iraqi military.
