there aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay away for as long as four years, says lawrence piro, chief of cancer research at scripps clinic &amp research foundation, la jolla, calif., where the drug was developed. since then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by hoffmann-la roche inc. and schering-plough corp. and an experimental drug called deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from hairy-cell leukemia. the researchers said the drug is easy to produce and thus is likely to be less expensive than other cancer treatments. within eight to 10 weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their blood or bone marrow the 12th had a small amount remaining in the marrow, but he declined further bone marrow monitoring, dr. piro said. it's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments. dr. piro said 2-cda has also been used effectively in initial trials to treat more common cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-hodgkins lymphoma and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. about 50% to 60% of patients -- most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the drug, some with complete remission, he said.
