the united states risks losing an unusual opportunity to assert global leadership in protecting antarctica, sen. it is calling on the united states and other nations participating in the conference, which begins monday in chile, to designate antarctica as a world science park. bruce vento (d-minn.), chairman of the house interior subcommittee on parks and public land, said he fears that recurring degradation has made antarctica an environmental time bomb ready to explode. we have no time for half-measures if america is to be the world's leader in protecting antarctica, vento said. congressional legislation calling for preservation of antarctica is awaiting president bush's signature, but there has been speculation that the interior department might urge bush to veto the measure. the legislation for the first time would apply u.s. environmental protection laws to any activity in antarctica sponsored by an agency of the u.s. government. the focus of a dispute between congress and the state department is the ratification of the convention on the regulation of antarctic mineral resources activities, on which the state department has worked for six years.
