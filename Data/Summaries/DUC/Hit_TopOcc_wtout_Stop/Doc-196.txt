egypt honored its slain parliament speaker and four security men today with a state funeral led by a grim-looking president hosni mubarak. the government said iraqi agents or egyptian moslem fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination friday of its second-highest official, rifaat el-mahgoub. hassan abu-basha, a former police minister, told the cairo newspaper al-ahram he believed el-mahgoub's slaying was the work of iraqi agents. hundreds of red-bereted military police and white-uniformed policemen sealed off all streets leading to the mosque where the religious service was held. they also lined the funeral procession route, as did hundreds of plainclothes security men. behind them were four military jeeps carrying coffins of the four security men, draped in the red, white and black egyptian flag. el-mahgoub's authority extended solely over the 458-seat parliament, which he had headed since 1984.
