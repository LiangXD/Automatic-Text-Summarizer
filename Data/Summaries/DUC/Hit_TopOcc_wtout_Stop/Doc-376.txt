a major earthquake rumbled through the jungles of southern sudan on sunday near the war-torn region's largest city, but officials said there appeared to be no casualties and little damage. juba, southern sudan's largest city, is 60 miles southwest of the quake's reported epicenter. egypt's two principal earthquake monitoring stations, including one at the aswan high dam, 600 miles south of cairo and just north of the sudan border, recorded the quake at 7.5 on the richter scale. the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. a magnitude of 7 is considered a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage. last october's earthquake near san francisco registered 7.1 on the richter scale. that earthquake zone stretches 4,000 miles from mozambique through the red sea to lebanon.
