dealing with his first major hurricane as director of the national hurricane center, bob sheets wasn't skipping a beat tuesday as a multitude of reporters fired questions at him. sheets, who was acting director during the 1987 atlantic hurricane season and was named director in march, spent most of the morning on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large monitor showing the destructive hurricane gilbert sprawled across much of the western caribbean. and interest in gilbert has been high since it started packing hurricane-force winds over the weekend and by tuesday afternoon became a category 5 storm with winds of 160 mph and a central pressure of 26.66 inches. a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale of strength has winds in excess of 155 mph and pressure less than 27.17 inches and has the potential for causing catastrophic damage. the last major hurricane to make landfall was elena in 1985, along the mississippi, alabama and florida panhandle. the major television networks, local stations and newspapers media were on hand to monitor the hurricane, which could reach the gulf of mexico by thursday, said sheets. dealing with a major hurricane isn't much different from dealing with smaller ones or tropical storms, sheets said, adding that gilbert has been particularly "well-behaved."
