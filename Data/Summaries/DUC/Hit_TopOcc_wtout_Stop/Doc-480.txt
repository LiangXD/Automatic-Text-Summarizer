house passage of a plan to raise the minimum wage shifts the partisan battle to the senate, where the leading proponent of an increase is urging president bush to refrain from further veto threats while congress settles on a final bill. the house voted 248-171 thursday in favor of legislation that would raise the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by october 1991, with the first increase taking effect later this year. kennedy has said he is open to amending his bill, and in a statement issued after the house vote he asked bush, who has threatened to veto any attempt to raise the hourly minimum above $4.25, to keep an open mind until the house and senate agree on a bill. bush has insisted that a six-month sub-minimum training wage covering all newly hired employees be created in any legislation to raise the minimum wage, a provision he said will help offset potential job losses caused by raising the minimum. sponsors of the house bill, while disputing gop projections of massive job losses, added a provision allowing a sub-minimum wage to be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job. as amended, the house bill would boost the minimum wage to $3.85 an hour on oct. current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less than $362,000 from the minimum-wage law the house bill increased that level to $500,000.
