en route, he heard that a primitive new guinea tribe, the fore, were dying in droves from an unknown brain disorder they called kuru, the shivering disease, because it started with tremors. soon kuru victims' brains started issuing from the heart of darkness to distant medical centers, compliments of dr. gajdusek. another link fell into place when igor klatzo, an nih scientist, noticed kuru brains resembled ones from cjd victims. based on the clues, dr. gajdusek, back at nih, led studies in the 1960s showing kuru, cjd and scrapie to be essentially the same infectious disease, studies that won the 1976 nobel prize for medicine. in the early 1980s, scientists discovered that cjd, like alzheimer's disease, often gums up the brain with a kind of junk, or amyloid, protein. still, dr. brown and other scientists aren't much worried about mad cows because their animal studies show spongiform disease is very hard to transmit orally. during the past few months, the nih team, working with dr. mitrova, has found a thread that for the first time may link many such cjd cases.
