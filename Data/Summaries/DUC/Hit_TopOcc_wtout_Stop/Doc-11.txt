us cities along the gulf of mexico from alabama to eastern texas were on storm watch last night as hurricane andrew headed west after sweeping across southern florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. mr justin balcombe, of uk-based insurance adjuster balcombe group, said total losses could exceed dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. that compares with the dollars 4bn-dollars 6n (pounds 2.1bn-pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big us hurricane, hugo, which hit south carolina in 1989. mr george lloyd-roberts, chairman of lloyd's underwriters' non-marine association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded pounds 3bn, the lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. mr roger hill, insurance analyst at warburg securities, said he estimated that mainline uk insurers faced no more than pounds 75m in damage claims so far. among other uk insurers, mr hill estimated that general accident may face losses of up to pounds 30m, while guardian royal exchange faced pounds 5m and sun alliance and commercial union pounds 10m each. however, hurricane andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the gulf of mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards new orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage.
