a steady decline in tuberculosis has all but stopped amid the continuing threat of tb for the aids-infected, federal health researchers say. in 1988, the last year for which complete statistics are available, 22,436 u.s. tuberculosis cases were reported, down 0.4 percent from 1987, the national centers for disease control reported thursday. if the 6.7 percent average annual decline had kept up through the late 1980s, an estimated 14,768 fewer tb cases would have been expected during 1985-1988, the cdc said in its weekly report. tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988, as compared with 1985, but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6 percent among hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higher rates of aids cases. in 1988, 7,720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites, compared with 8,280 in blacks and 3,637 in hispanics. the tb rate among blacks was 28.3 per 100,000, compared with 18.3 for hispanics and 4.1 for whites. another 2,371 tb cases were reported among asians and pacific islanders in the united states, for a rate of 36.3 per 100,000.
