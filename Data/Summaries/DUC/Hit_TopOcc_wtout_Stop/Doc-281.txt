6 ballot would, among other things, limit the terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators. proposition 131 would limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive four-year terms, state legislators to 12 consecutive years in office proposition 140 would hold assembly members to six years in office, state senators and statewide elected officials to eight. term limits would give the people of california more control over the legislature, and the legislature would be less prone to special interests, because legislators would know they are going to be there for six years and they're out. but legislatures also need strong committee chairmen, and term limits mean that relatively inexperienced people are going to be in leadership and that they are -- by definition -- lame ducks from the very beginning. there has been a national movement that started in california, 25 years ago, to really strengthen the role of legislatures and to make them co-equal branches of government things like term limitations, which would restrict the power and authority of legislatures, are a step backward in that movement. as to what are the implications of term limitations in the state of california, a lot of people think that this is a partisan issue. if there are constant changes, the impact of term limits would be to empower the bureaucracy -- the people who are not elected -- and (they) would definitely empower the special interests who have the finances and the ability to assist the bureaucrats.
