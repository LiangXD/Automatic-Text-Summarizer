the true record of judge bork could not be more different from the claims of archie bunker ads and archie bunker senators. contrary to the smears, robert bork has not been a racist, sexist, sterilizer or bedroom spy in his careers as yale law professor, u.s. solicitor general or appeals judge. the lobbyists actually did a poll to find the best issues for distorting judge bork's views. even harvard's laurence tribe got into the game by mischaracterizing judge bork's ninth amendment views, not to mention justice black's. a harris poll that included a falsified quote from judge bork was trumpeted to prove that most americans opposed judge bork. he told an alabama radio station that he was troubled by judge bork's extremism -- an admission that he had been a socialist, a libertarian, that he nearly became a communist, and actually recruited people to attend communist party meetings, and had a strange life style. the symbols they created for judge bork were brazen lies about a distinguished jurist.
