turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at venetia, de beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from south africa's borders with botswana and zimbabwe. only weeks before the mine came into production in july 1992 at a cost of usdollars 400m, de beers' central selling organisation, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from angola. mr gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the 5.6m carats a year de beers predicted venetia would yield at full production. venetia was the first new south african diamond mine for 25 years. the mine has also revitalised de beers' production, as it is accounting for half the group's output in south africa and replacing production from its 100-year-old kimberley mines, which are now fading away. venetia's success is strategically important to de beers because, when its output is added to that in botswana and namibia, it gives the group direct control over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output. and, while venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected 23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour relations and environmental issues, at least as far as south africa is concerned.
