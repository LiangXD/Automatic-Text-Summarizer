a colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the english channel from the white cliffs of dover, pursuing a dream born in napoleon's time that is coming true at last. tunneling speed at the dover end is less than 15 feet an hour and the machine boring from the geologically more complex french end moves even slower, which is why the tunnel will not open until 1993. state-owned british rail will not commit itself to building a high-speed link from london to the tunnel in time to make the three-hour journey a reality in 1993. eurotunnel, the anglo-french consortium that will own the tunnel, is urging british rail to speed its plans. with trade barriers among the 12 eec countries set to fall in 1992, colin kirkland, technical director of eurotunnel's on the british side, says the tunnel will be completed this time. eurotunnel ordered a management shakeup and threatened trans-manche link, the consortium of 10 british and french engineering companies building the tunnel, with penalties of $25 million if the diggers did not pass the three-mile mark by nov. eurotunnel will run shuttle trains once every three minutes at peak times between terminals near folkestone and calais, and british rail and the frenh state railroad will operate trains from london and paris.
