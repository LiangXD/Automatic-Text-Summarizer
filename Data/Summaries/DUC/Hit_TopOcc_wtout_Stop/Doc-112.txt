"after surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by a ventilator. miss taylor entered daniel freeman marina hospital on april 9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said. while it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator, it does not mean that person is near death, said dr. john g. mohler, a university of southern california lung disease expert who emphasized he had no direct knowledge of miss taylor's condition. doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restore oxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathing difficulties have reduced those levels, mohler said.
