mr philip tose, the maverick hong kong financier, once offered britain's tory party pounds 5m to remove mr chris patten, hong kong's governor. 'mr patten is the governor and the representative of the hong kong british government,' says one senior chinese official in hong kong. however, the basic law - the china-drafted mini-constitution for post-1997 hong kong - does not provide for a provisional legislature as such, although it does foresee a 'preparatory committee' to be formed in 1996 that will determine who sits in this legislature. a strong showing by hong kong's pro-democracy groups, led by mr martin lee's democratic party, will be seen as a protest vote against beijing. china's supporters in the colony claim that mr patten's policy is now to make hong kong harder to govern by 'loosening the screws' before the british leave. mr zhou nan, the most senior representative of the chinese communist party and government in hong kong, recently attacked mr patten's plans for a government-funded pension, saying: 'during the transition period, we should not casually transplant a costly euro-socialist pay-as-you-go concept to hong kong without prudently taking into consideration similar western programmes' long-standing track record of grossly under-estimating liabilities and grossly over-estimating funding projections.' mr patten claims that by 1997 public spending in hong kong as a percentage of gdp will be lower than it was in 1982 - the year britain began handover negotiations with china.
