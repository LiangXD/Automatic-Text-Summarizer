augustus hawkins (d., calif.), who head the senate and house labor committees, are expected to introduce legislation to increase the minimum wage from its current rate of $3.35 an hour to about $4.65 hourly over three years, with future automatic annual adjustments. the minimum wage simply has not kept up with rising living standards and rising median wages, adds jeff faux, president of the economic policy institute, a liberal think tank. he and others concede that increases in the minimum wage do result in some job losses. the chamber claims that 644,000 jobs were lost as a result of the last minimum-wage increase. about 61 million workers in a national work force of 120 million are covered by the minimum-wage law. nearly 3.5 million hourly workers earn the minimum wage, according to the labor department, but it's expected that any increase would also benefit the nearly 1.5 million workers who are paid below the minimum and others who earn slightly above the minimum. republicans have warned they may counter the push to expand the minimum wage with a long-sought subminimum wage for teens, but an administration official says no decision has yet been made on its position on an increase.
