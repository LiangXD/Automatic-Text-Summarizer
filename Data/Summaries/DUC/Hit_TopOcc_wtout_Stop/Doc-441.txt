'only god can help us through this crisis,' said the afrikaner preacher called to provide spiritual guidance to south africa's farmers, who have been hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory. mr jg wilson of the local agricultural co-operative says maize farmers in the area - one of the largest maize producing regions - have already lost 80 to 100 per cent of their crops. but mr koos du toit, chief economist of the south african agricultural union, says it is the worst drought he has ever seen, and the most widespread. mr du toit endorses comparisons with 1933, a highly emotive year for afrikaners because of the numbers forced off the land by drought. the maize board, the state marketing board, expects a crop of 4m tonnes, though mr du toit believes it could be closer to 3m or 3.5m, which would make it the worst harvest in 50 years. none the less, pretoria is understood to be contemplating substantial drought aid for farmers: several hundred million rands, or perhaps as much as r1bn (pounds 200m) over two to three years. without such aid, the maize board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de grace.
