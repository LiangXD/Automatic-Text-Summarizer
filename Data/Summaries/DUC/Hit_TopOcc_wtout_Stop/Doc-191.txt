about 20 of them intensify into stronger disturbances, ranging from tropical depressions, with wind speeds to 38 mph to tropical storms, with winds from 39 to 73 mph to hurricanes, with winds exceeding 74 mph. fourteen became tropical storms, seven of which became hurricanes, fewer than usual. historically, south florida has had more hurricanes than any other site, said jerry jarrell, a hurricane specialist eyeing miami's 27-year hiatus nervously. we would expect a major hurricane to hit within 75 miles of miami every eight years. at the center, scientists built a computer model to calculate what would happen if the 1926 hurricane were to hit miami today. that storm was almost exactly the strength of hurricane hugo, which hit in south carolina with 135 mph winds in september 1989. hurricanes change direction and intensify in a matter of hours and, in 24 hours, the specialists said, they could miscalculate one's track by 100 miles.
