michael milken, who faces insider trading charges, is seen as the wall street whiz kid who made "junk-bond" financing into the tool of choice for corporate raiders. in so doing, milken, 42, transformed drexel burnham lambert inc. from a minor player on wall street into a powerhouse and in the process made himself feared, respected and enormously wealthy. the 184-page civil complaint filed in u.s. district court in new york against milken, drexel and others on wednesday followed months of speculation about drexel's involvement in the ivan boesky insider trading scandal. although the move by the securities and exchange commission had been anticipated, milken and others who have made fortunes in junk bonds continued to hold their annual beverly hills spring gathering known as the predators' ball. it was business as usual at drexel, and milken was still king of the junk bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate takeovers. in the years before the insider trading scandal, the financial media wrote glowingly of milken. milken reportedly pulls down $40 million a year as the head of drexel's junk-bond operation and his personal fortune has been estimated at more than $500 million.
