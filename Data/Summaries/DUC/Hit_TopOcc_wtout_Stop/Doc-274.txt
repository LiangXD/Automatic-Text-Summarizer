florida's attorney general has asked its state supreme court for an advisory opinion on a term-limit initiative that would limit the state's members of congress to eight consecutive years in office. three u.s. house members, led by democrat larry smith, have filed briefs asking the court to rule state term limits unconstitutional. by 6 to 1, the california supreme court ruled this month that the state's new term-limit law was constitutional. the court said the state's strong interests in protecting against an entrenched, dynastic legislative bureaucracy outweighed objections that term limits restrict voter choice at the ballot box. but the court's decision affected only term limits on state officials federal officeholders weren't included in california's limits. on this basis, term limits merely ensure a fair election system and the republican form of government guaranteed the states under the constitution. should the court rule against term limits by the states, numerous other ballot access restrictions will likely be passed that have many of the same effects as term limits.
