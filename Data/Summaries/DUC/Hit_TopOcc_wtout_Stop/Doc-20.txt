a white long beach police officer who allegedly pushed a black man through a plate-glass window during an arrest that was secretly videotaped by a television crew acknowledged friday that he made errors in his official report. the incident received nationwide attention after a camera hidden in jackson's car videotaped the arrest, during which dickey swore at jackson after stopping his car for an alleged traffic violation and then appeared to push his head through a plate-glass window. at the hearing, boatwright repeatedly played the videotape while committee members and about 50 observers watched on television monitors and dickey and jackson commented on each scene. boatwright questioned whether the car in which jackson was riding was actually weaving -- the stated cause for the traffic stop -- and whether jackson acted aggressively toward the officers, as dickey said in his report. earlier, under questioning by boatwright and as the videotape was played, dickey testified that the alleged infraction for which the jackson car was stopped -- crossing the center divider -- occurred before it could be seen on a tape shot from the nbc chase vehicle, but he maintained that the tape does show jackson's car weaving slowly within the traffic lane. boatwright, standing in front of the television monitor, pointed out that a videotape shot from the jackson car's rear window shows the street lights passing by in a consistent pattern -- indicating the car was not weaving. dickey acknowledged that the police car he was driving was weaving all over, too as it tailed jackson's car.
