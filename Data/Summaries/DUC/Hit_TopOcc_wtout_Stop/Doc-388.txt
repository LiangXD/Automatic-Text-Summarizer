the uss vincennes' destruction of an iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake organization said sunday. "on the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the captain acted the best way he knew how," said william e. brooks jr., publisher of the vincennes sun-commercial newspaper and a member of the uss vincennes association. the two u.s. missiles were fired by uss vincennes, an aegis class cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles. association member gene thurmond, 65, of evansville, served on the second uss vincennes, a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and sunk by japanese cruisers in 1942. a light cruiser named for vincennes was commissioned in 1944 and received six battle stars for service in world war ii before it was decommissioned in september 1946. the association's 500 members meet annually in vincennes to reminisce about their years of service and pay tribute to the dead, said vincennes liaison officer and honorary member, bill toth, 64. members of the association were considering a tribute to the 290 people who were killed.
