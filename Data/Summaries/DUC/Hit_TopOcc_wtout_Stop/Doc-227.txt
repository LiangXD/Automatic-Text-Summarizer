it is ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by miners in angola and canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the world's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market. the onset of the dry season and the fall in river levels from the end of may this year has encouraged what de beers, the south african group that dominates the world diamond business, describes as 'a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply of illicit angolan diamonds reaching the market'. the cartel is organised by de beers' london-based central selling organisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds. apart from de beers' own production from namibia and south africa, the cso handles rough gem diamonds from angola, australia, botswana, russia, tanzania and zaire. the cso has been mopping up as many of the smuggled angolan diamonds as possible to stop havoc being created in a business already suffering severely from soggy demand in the us and japan, the two biggest markets, which share about two-thirds of demand between them. de beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market through 'sights' offered by the cso ten times a year to about 160 selected buyers. 'what the cso for many years has done successfully, is to operate a buffer pool, stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand is in excess of the level of supply.
