a federal judge sentenced an apparently stunned michael milken to 10 years in prison wednesday after ruling that the crimes he pleaded guilty to were neither minor nor isolated. wood said evidence presented during a pre-sentencing hearing in october convinced her that milken had committed additional serious crimes beyond the six felony counts he pleaded guilty to in april. at liman's request, the judge agreed to sentence milken under a provision of federal law that allows him to be paroled at any time at the discretion of the federal parole commission. although milken technically could be paroled almost immediately, government lawyers said the commission normally requires prisoners to serve close to two-thirds of their sentence. several lawyers said they interpreted the long sentence as an attempt by the judge to ensure that milken cooperates fully, revealing whatever incriminating information he knows about corporate raiders, junk bond buyers and former co-workers. john c. coffee, a columbia university law professor, said the judge may also have imposed the severe sentence because milken occupied a position of trust at the center of the financial world. october 1990: special two-week hearing to consider the government's array of charges against milken, ordered by u.s. district judge kimba wood to gain greater insight into milken's character in order to fashion a fair sentence for the six counts he admitted.
