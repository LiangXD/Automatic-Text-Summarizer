less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed colombia to the brink of political chaos. two other presidential candidates had already been assassinated during the campaign for may 27 elections. on saturday antonio navarro, a longtime guerrilla leader of the april 19 movement, announced he would take pizarro's place as candidate for president. former president alfonso lopez said the assassinations of three candidates indicated that colombia's armed forces must be reorganized. one of the country's presidential candidates, alvaro gomez, said friday that barco should name a three-man council to run colombia's security forces to avoid a military coup. "never has there been such a great and pathetic image of anarchy," said gomez, a presidential candidate of the conservative party. both barco and his party's presidential candidate, cesar gaviria, have linked colombia's salvation to constitutional reform.
