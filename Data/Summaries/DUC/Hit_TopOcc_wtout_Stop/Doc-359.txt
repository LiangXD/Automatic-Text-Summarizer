iraqi president saddam hussein has sought to tighten his grip on power by turning over key government roles to trusted family members. publicly, saddam is seen on iraqi television presiding over meetings of the revolutionary command council and visiting villages, and he has promised his people to rebuild the country scores of times better than what the allied forces destroyed. smoke and soot continue to pour from hundreds of oil wells set ablaze by the fleeing army of iraqi president saddam hussein. about half the old workers were foreigners, especially palestinians, who either fled the country during the war or have been ordered by the kuwaiti government to stay off work because of alleged iraqi sympathies. while the threat of a landing tied down six iraqi divisions defending the kuwait coast, there was no amphibious assault from the persian gulf. roughly 70,000 shiite refugees from the basra region are believed to still be encamped in iran because they fear reprisals from iraqi leader saddam hussein. in the first major assessment of the war, the environmental group greenpeace reported last week that as many as 221,000 iraqi people died as a result of the war and its aftermath.
