the focus of the drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most areas, the national weather service reported thursday. long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the great lakes region and the ohio and tennessee valleys, the agency's climate analysis center reported. in addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the northern great plains and rocky mountains. the drought has been accompanied by higher than normal temperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western great lakes region. however, in the midwest, the weather service reported that large areas have experienced the driest april-june period on record since 1895. in addition to thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-range outlook through july 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain hotter than normal, particularly the tennessee valley, lower midwest, central and northern great plains, northern rockies and great basin. the only areas escaping heat in the forecast are the nation's northwestern and northeastern corners and the louisiana-texas-new mexico area.
