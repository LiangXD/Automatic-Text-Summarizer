an official statement issued friday confirmed that federal military commanders met in march and considered ways to quell dissent in slovenia. the statement by slovenia's information ministry followed reports published by the slovenian youth magazine mladina that there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic. the ministry statement said the federal military council met on march 25 and concluded that "dissident tendencies" in slovenia were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's communist government. slovenia's communist party presidium also "expressed disagreement with part of the military council's opinions," said the statement. and slovenian communists have frequently criticized the way the federal government is dealing with the country's economic and social problems. it published a letter to slovenia's communist party leader milan kucan from two student unions that said military action had been planned earlier this year, including the arrests of "nonconformist journalists, writers and officials." the plan was blocked by kucan and stane dolanc, slovenia's member in yugoslavia's collective presidency, after they were told about it by slovenian security organizations, the letter said.
