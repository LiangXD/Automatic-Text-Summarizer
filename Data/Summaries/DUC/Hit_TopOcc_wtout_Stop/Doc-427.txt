the suit and other documents allege that keating and his associates sought to evade regulatory restrictions on such investments by making bogus loans to straw property buyers. </p> <p> they also devised a tax plan that let them divert $95 million to lincoln's parent company by creating phantom profits through sham land swaps and loans, the regulators allege, and used accounting gimmicks, legal maneuvering and political string-pulling to further their operations and slow down investigators. </p> <p> the senate ethics committee decided last week to appoint an outside counsel to investigate sen. in 1979, lindner and keating consented to a securities and exchange commission order prohibiting them from fraudulently diverting corporate assets to their personal use. </p> <p> by the early 1980s, keating -- riding the tide of explosive growth in the sun belt -- had built the former lindner construction firm, renamed american continental corp., into one of the nation's 10 biggest home builders. </p> <p> moreover, he -- like others -- had noticed a new opportunity: congress, trying to rescue a savings and loan industry saddled with traditional low-rate, long-term home mortgage loans in an era of soaring interest rates, was dismantling the web of federal regulations that had always circumscribed the industry. </p> <p> under deregulation, banks and s&amp ls were allowed to place a part of their assets in direct investments such as ownership interests in real estate projects and other ventures, instead of just making loans on which they would collect interest. that increased lincoln's direct investments to about 40% of its $2.2 billion in assets. </p> <p> customers targeted </p> <p> in 1986, keating and his executives came up with an innovative way to raise unrestricted funds for american continental: they would sell debt securities similar to the bonds issued by most of america's major corporations. about two-thirds of them were elderly southern californians who bought them at lincoln branch offices. </p> <p> some of them have said in lawsuits and congressional testimony that they were persuaded to buy the securities instead of certificates of deposit by american continental sales representatives, who assured them that the securities were safe. </p> <p> some have said they thought that the debentures were backed by federal deposit insurance -- a costly mistake, as things turned out. </p> <p> regulators cool </p> <p> by 1986, federal regulators in the regional office in san francisco were becoming distinctly unsympathetic to keating's operations. they concluded that keating was handling lincoln in an unsafe and unsound manner. </p> <p> in particular, examiners reported that lincoln had made a substantial number of loans without proper appraisals, without verification of borrowers' credit and even, in some cases, without a loan application. </p> <p> to a large extent, the examiners said in their reports, it appeared that lincoln was making bogus loans in an effort to get around the new restrictions on direct investments in real estate and to record profits that it had not really earned. </p> <p> many major loans were made to straw buyers: people who bought properties with lincoln funds on favorable terms and who never intended to repay the loans, thus leaving the savings and loan in control of the properties, the regulatory reports allege. </p> <p> the examiners said that, after making the loans, lincoln claimed as profits the up-front fees and interest such loans normally generate. instead, american continental collected money from all its subsidiaries, then filed a consolidated tax return and made tax payments to the irs on their behalf. </p> <p> over a period of a little more than two years, lincoln made $95 million in tax-sharing payments to its parent company, ostensibly to cover taxes on profits it had earned. </p> <p> but the government alleges in its racketeering lawsuit and other documents that lincoln did not owe $95 million in taxes at the time and that american continental never paid any of that money to the irs. </p> <p> keating and his subordinates engaged in a series of sham transactions designed to create the appearance of higher profits, and thus higher tax obligations, as a device for siphoning money out of lincoln and moving it to american continental, which kept the extra funds, according to federal investigators. </p> <p> higher profits also boosted american continental's stock price. the phoenician opened in late 1988, and, although it is generating tremendous income -- $4.3 million last month alone -- it is not generating enough to pay off its construction debt, regulators claim. </p> <p> lincoln never was a viable institution under keating, said bert ely, an alexandria, va.-based consultant to the savings and loan industry. </p> <p> last week, government regulators seized control of the phoenician and another lincoln property, the crescent hotel in phoenix, ousting keating and as many as 30 of his associates from management of the lodges. </p> <p> seizure occurs </p> <p> the government finally seized lincoln on april 14, 1989, declaring that it was being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner and that keating and his executives were dissipating its assets. </p> <p> the day before lincoln was seized, american continental filed for protection from creditors in u.s. bankruptcy court in phoenix.
