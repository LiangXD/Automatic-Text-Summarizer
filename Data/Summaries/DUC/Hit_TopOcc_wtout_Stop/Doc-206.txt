britain and france were linked beneath the english channel on tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported. management sources at transmanche link, the construction consortium building the "chunnel" - the channel tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when british workers sent the probe through to french colleagues. two japanese-designed boring machines are drilling the tunnel. a work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding more pay on the french side appeared likely monday to stall the linkup until the weekend or beyond. taking into account all the tunnels, 80 percent of the drilling has been completed by giant, japanese-built boring machines working from calais and folkstone, england. tuesday's linkup in the service tunnel is described by the french as a "mouse ole" - a bore only two inches in diameter. the first coupling of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.
