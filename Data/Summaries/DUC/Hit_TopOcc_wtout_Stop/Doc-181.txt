william gray, a professor of atmospheric science at colorado state university, said friday he expects about six atlantic hurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but above average for the decade. those years brought just two to five hurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985. 1. gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annual hurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his first formal 1988 forecast in late may. "it is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season," gray said in a paper presented to the conference. his prediction of four in 1986 was on the money, and he originally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figure to seven, the eventual correct number, in 1985. in 1984, when there were five hurricanes, gray had predicted seven. drought in west africa is responsible for a drop in atlantic hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, gray said.
