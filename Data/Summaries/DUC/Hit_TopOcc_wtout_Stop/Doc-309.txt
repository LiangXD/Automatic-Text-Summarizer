today the senate sacrificed the integrity of the supreme court, its own reputation and the rights of american women to the bush-reagan agenda, the women's legal defense fund said in a statement released after the vote. in norman, okla., the woman whose complaints prompted the extraordinary weekend hearings on sexual harassment allegations against thomas said she hoped his confirmation wouldn't stop others from complaining about harassment in the workplace. law professor anita hill, once an aide to thomas, declined to comment specifically about the senate vote. professor hill's allegations cannot be used to justify a vote against judge thomas, sen. the hearings on the harassment charges led only four previously pro-thomas democrats to change their minds and vote against him: richard bryan and harry reid of nevada, joseph lieberman of connecticut and bob graham of florida. as the youngest supreme court justice, thomas is expected to remain on the high court for decades, long enough to grapple with anticipated 21st-century legal issues stemming from new reproductive technologies, gay and lesbian claims to family rights, experimental drugs, multinational business arrangements and other developments. how they voted here is the 52-48 roll call by which the senate voted to confirm clarence thomas to the u.s. supreme court.
