the site of the signing ceremony in sacramento sent a warning to the city's congressman, mr bob matsui, one of the leading proponents of nafta in the us house of representatives. anti-nafta crusaders drove caravans through tennessee, california and texas to mobilise opposition. with just a shoestring budget - no more than dollars 200,000 (pounds 134,230) a year in cash - foes of nafta have worked for three years to mount a massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the american public. nafta's us proponents - mostly the business community - are spending millions, bypassing the voters, to convince congress to pass nafta. although the clinton administration weeks ago said it would appoint a 'nafta czar' to shepherd the pact through congress, it has yet to announce it has found anyone to take on the task. by contrast, the opposition has an 'anti-nafta czar' in place and making speeches around the country. the side pacts will be 'silly,' she said, 'it's the same old bush nafta with the supplementals used to create a fig-leaf.'
