u.s. air force war planes participating in operation desert shield are flying again after they were ordered grounded for 24 hours following a rash of crashes. at the pentagon, spokesman pete williams said the number of u.s. aircraft accidents in the gulf - including three separate crashes this week - were not out of the ordinary. desert shield, the largest u.s. military buildup since the vietnam war, involves an estimated 700 air force combat and support aircraft. the toll for accidental deaths since operation desert shield began rose to 31 on wednesday when an air force f-111 fighter-bomber crashed on a training mission in saudi arabia, killing both crew members. on monday, two pilots were killed in the crash of an air force f-4 phantom reconnaissance jet in saudi arabia, and just hours earlier two marine corps uh-1 huey helicopters, each carrying four crew members, crashed over the arabian sea, killing all eight men. five u.s. aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in the gulf area since the start of desert shield two months ago: an f-111, an f-4 phantom reconnaissance jet, an f-15e and two marine corps uh-1 huey helicopters. also, 20 other aircraft have been involved in non-fatal accidents in the gulf area, williams said.
