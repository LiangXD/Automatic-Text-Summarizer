the new year ushers in a new wildfire season, an unwelcome thought to the residents of this small montana tourist town on the northeastern corner of yellowstone national park. for two months last summer the citizens of cooke city and its tiny suburb, silver gate, were showcased on the nightly tv news and splashed across the front pages of the nation's newspapers as forest fires threatened to burn them out. the u.s. forest service, which coordinated some of its firefighting efforts from cooke city, set up shop near the photocopy machine, and everybody who had information or was seeking some crammed into the smiths' log cabin office. like nearly everybody else in cooke city and silver gate, mrs. smith says she never wants to go through another summer like the last one. because of the unprecedented fire season which burned nearly 1.5 million acres in the greater yellowstone ecosystem, including 705,000 acres within the national park, mrs. smith and her friends and neighbors worry about what's happening underneath the blanket of snow this winter. rod norum, a fire behavior analyst with the national park service, said he would not be surprised if pockets of fire are found in the greater yellowstone area come spring. in his 18 years of studying wildfires, norum has come across several incidents where wildfires buried themselves in the roots of trees and grasses and smoldered all winter only to pop up through the snow in the spring.
