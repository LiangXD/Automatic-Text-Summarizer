coast guard commandant paul a. yost on tuesday attacked exxon's plan to clean up the alaskan oil spill. in washington, consumer activist ralph nader said exxon "should not be allowed to forget" the spill and that a boycott would send the oil giant a message. he and others blasted exxon for failing to be prepared for the spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that fouled hundreds of miles of alaska's coast. exxon's 60-page, two-part revised strategy to cleanse some 364 miles of alaska's coastline of the oil spilled march 24 by the tanker exxon valdez was released monday. the tanker struck a reef 25 miles from valdez, spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound. oil has tainted the coast at least as far as chignik, 525 miles southwest of valdez. exxon's plan also notes that 191 miles of coastline it describes as "lightly oiled" may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally by wind and water.
