crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s. cotton deliveries are forecast at less than 90,000 tonnes, down from 205,000 tonnes in 1991, soyabeans at 30,000 tonnes (133,000 tonnes last year), while winter wheat production is expected to fall to less than a third of normal levels. at zdollars 3.7bn (pounds 410m) last year, agriculture accounted for almost 20 per cent of gross domestic product, though in real terms, it was 8 per cent below the mid-1980s peak. following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the zimbabwean dollar, exports of farm produce in us dollar terms will be sharply lower, with tobacco earnings of less than usdollars 500m, compared with dollars 520m in 1991 (28 per cent of total exports). the traditional suppliers of maize to these countries - south africa and zimbabwe - will be importing up to 7m tonnes themselves this year (5m tonnes for south africa and 2m tonnes for zimbabwe). next year's crop and livestock production will remain below average - even if good rains fall - as early plantings will be reduced because of a lack of irrigation. at best, it will take the industry until 1994-95 to regain average production levels of the late 1980s, while the economy as a whole is unlikely to recover fully from the drought of 1992 for at least two years.
