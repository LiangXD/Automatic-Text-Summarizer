backed by public antipathy toward the exxon valdez oil spill disaster, gov. after meeting personally with top executives from three of the seven oil companies that own the alyeska pipeline service co. earlier in the week, cowper asked them to respond by noon thursday to his six-point safety plan. in one proposed draft of an order, continuation of routine operations at the alyeska marine terminal near the town of valdez is described as creating a substantial potential risk of additional oil spill because the consortium has failed to demonstrate it can manage a large spill with minimal environmental effects. to reduce the risk, the order, which could be issued as soon as today, would require: -- a written description, due within 72 hours of the order's being signed, of the location of all oil-spill gear at the consortium's disposal. equipment must be dedicated to oil-spill cleanup only. -- the names of 12 oil spill-response team members who do nothing but respond to oil spills and who are available for such duty 24 hours a day. installation of booms -- the installation of containment booms around all oil tankers in the harbor. -- permanent restriction of tanker traffic to daylight hours. -- a limit of one tanker being loaded at a time until all designated cleanup equipment is in place, and the end of all loading within 72 hours if cleanup equipment is not ready. -- demonstration by april 30 of adequate gear and supplies to handle another 10-million-gallon spill. the alyeska companies' offer included the immediate start of random drug and alcohol testing on board ships and the continued use of two-tugboat escorts beyond bligh reef, the shallows into which the exxon valdez crashed march 24 before leaking 240,000 barrels of oil into ecologically sensitive prince william sound.
