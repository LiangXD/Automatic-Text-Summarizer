mr. sununu, president bush's chief of staff, is a combative, conservative republican with a history of ambushing liberal democrats like sen. mr. sununu was a hard-charging governor who ran the new hampshire statehouse with an iron hand, earning mr. bush's trust when he engineered a crucial victory in the 1988 new hampshire primary. in the last stages of preparing mr. bush's mammoth clean air act proposals, for instance, mr. sununu called together environmental protection agency chief william reilly and white house staffers for a marathon meeting to craft a compromise settling a dispute over regulations to cut auto emissions. and although the white house chief of staff has toned down since that early encounter, in a recent meeting with gop house members, mr. sununu suggested that republicans attack a crime package proposed by democratic sen. mr. sununu also rankled some republican congressional leaders by dressing them down at a recent white house meeting for failing to properly support mr. bush's programs. and whatever his relations with others, mr. sununu's most important relationship -- the one with president bush -- appears sturdy. the other day, mr. sununu and two other advisers were sitting in front of mr. bush's desk waiting for the president.
