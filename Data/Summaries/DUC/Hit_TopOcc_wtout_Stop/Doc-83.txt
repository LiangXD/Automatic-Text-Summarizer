the research found that when living conditions are identical, black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the tb bacteria. "we found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks," said dr. william w. stead. when they were retested at least two months later, 14 percent of blacks and 7 percent of whites showed evidence of new infections. stead's study found that blacks got infected more readily than whites, regardless of the race of the person who initially brought the infection into the nursing home. in homes where the initial source of the disease was white, 17 percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites caught the infection. when the primary source was black, 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted the bacteria. this phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.
