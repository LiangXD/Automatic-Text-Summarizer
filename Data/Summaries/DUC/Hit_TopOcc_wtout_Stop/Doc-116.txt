elizabeth taylor suffered complications including new infections in her fifth week of hospitalization for pneumonia, and will remain hospitalized for about six more weeks, doctors said friday. the recovery of miss taylor, near death two weeks ago with viral pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection, her doctors said. bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than the viral pneumonia miss taylor initially contracted. "she is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctors are pleased with her progress," miss taylor's publicist, chen sam, said after talking to doctors. during a news conference last month, miss taylor's doctors revealed she was near death on april 22. the oscar-winning star of "who's afraid of virginia woolf?" and "butterfield 8" entered daniel freeman marina hospital on april 9 with a sinus infection, but her condition deteriorated and she was moved to st. john's for treatment of viral pneumonia. visitors throughout miss taylor's hospitalization included her four children, maria burton-carson, liza todd-tivey and christopher and michael wilding.
