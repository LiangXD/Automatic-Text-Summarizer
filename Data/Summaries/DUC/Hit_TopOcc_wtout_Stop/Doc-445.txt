even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, lipman said. scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the mount unzen volcano in japan, he said. the five usgs scientists are among the few remaining people at clark air base, which was evacuated along with thousands of filipinos living near the volcano. the researchers, along with 10 filipino scientists and their equipment, today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches. if it does have a massive eruption, pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path. in the worst case, a really big eruption, all of clark air force base could be covered with glowing ash, lipman said. the volcano's activity -- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, lipman said.
