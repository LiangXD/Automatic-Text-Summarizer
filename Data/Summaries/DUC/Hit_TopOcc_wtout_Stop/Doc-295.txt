a crippled united airlines dc-10 crashed a half-mile short of a runway while trying to make an emergency landing wednesday afternoon, bursting into a cartwheeling fireball that broke into what one eyewitness described as 15,000 pieces and killing at least 123 of the 293 passengers and crew members on board. tail engine explodes the plane's tail engine exploded before the crash but it was not immediately clear how the explosion contributed to what a federal aviation administration spokesman called complete hydraulic failure, an occurrence regarded as extremely rare in the wide-bodied dc-10, which has three independent hydraulic systems that operate all the plane's control surfaces on its wings and tail, and landing gear and brakes. suitcases, paper, mail, clothes, chunks of burning metal and bodies were strewn over the inactive runway at sioux gateway airport, where the plane crashed after desperately circling for a half-hour. eyewitnesses said pieces of the 15-year-old airplane -- one of the oldest airliners in united's fleet -- were falling off as far as 75 miles from the site of the crash. there were reports from passengers and observers that the plane's right-wing engine also failed before the crash. c. haynes -- a 33-year veteran of the airline who along with the other 10 crew members survived the crash -- struggled for a half-hour to maintain control of the wobbling plane. on tuesday, a united dc-10 with 249 people aboard slid 300 yards on the runway after landing at rain-soaked o'hare international airport in chicago but there were no injuries.
