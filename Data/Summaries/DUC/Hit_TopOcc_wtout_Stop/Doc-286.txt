twelve million americans have some form of diabetes, but it is most prevalent among minorities, especially native americans, blacks and hispanics. hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population, and 40 percent of the 700,000 victims in texas are mexican-american. san antonio's hispanic makeup led dr. ralph defronzo to abandon his prestigious position as a yale university diabetes researcher and persuade his four-member team to relocate to the university of texas health science center. an epidemiologist at the center, dr. michael stern, has devoted 10 years to studying hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study of type ii diabetes. stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income hispanics, fewer would get the disease. between 1979 and 1988, stern and his staff studied more than 5,000 people and found that 387 of 2,905 hispanics had the disease, or 13.3 percent, compared to only 87 of 1,780 anglos, or 4.8 percent. researchers believe that poor hispanics' diets of cheap, processed foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention _ either due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors _ increases their risk of acquiring diabetes.
