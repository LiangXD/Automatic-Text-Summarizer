a french dc-10 jetliner with 171 people aboard experienced a powerful high-altitude explosion, possibly from a terrorist bomb, before crashing in a remote desert region of niger in northern africa, officials in france said wednesday. ever since, one intelligence official said wednesday, the french government has realized that its planes were being targeted for some sort of terrorist attack. a more likely possibility, speculated terrorist experts and one intelligence source in washington, was a terrorist attack on behalf of pro-syrian muslim forces in lebanon. the french foreign ministry declined to comment wednesday about the possibility of a terrorist attack. in santa monica, a rand corp. analyst, bruce hoffman, said wednesday he believed the attack was probably staged by shiite muslim groups concerned that france might intervene in lebanon on behalf of the maronite christians led by aoun. while france's willingness to bargain with terrorists for the freedom of hostages had in the past created a modus vivendi that appeared to spare the country from violent attacks, hoffman and other analysts suggested that the stakes in lebanon had become too important for those old rules to apply. according to intelligence specialists, security at the airport in chad at which the plane stopped is under the control of french officials.
