supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path hurricane hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast. forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models to track hugo's path into charleston, s.c. pinpointing the exact point of hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation. the real forecasting problem with hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into charleston. using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland, md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane. to determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane. satellites can give a "pretty picture," he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path.
