president reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and agriculture secretary richard lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government's conservation reserve program. before the drought began damaging crops this month, the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers. few in farming expect the drought to trigger an agricultural recession, although more farmers could go bankrupt because of it. it's already getting harder to sell farmers tractors because of the drought, says james k. ashford, case president and chief executive officer. before the drought we expected a very solid year for farm lenders, says mark drabenstott, an economist at the kansas city federal reserve bank. the decision by mr. lyng, the secretary of agriculture, to allow hay-mowing for 30 days on conservation reserve program land came as farmers and ranchers in north dakota, minnesota and other states continued to sell off livestock in response to shortages of hay and other forage crops. the department said it won't allow livestock-grazing on land in the soil-conservation program, under which farmers are paid to take erodible acreage out of crop production.
