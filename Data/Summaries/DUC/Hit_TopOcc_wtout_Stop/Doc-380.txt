a lie detector that measures brain waves would be more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says its developer. rosenfeld's lie detector picks up brain-wave activity through electrodes attached to the scalp, amplifying the signals and feeding them into a computer, which coordinates the information and displays it on a video screen. "if sensory information has a special meaning for you... then your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the p3 wave," he said. "occasionally, they'll see a word that is meaningful, like some anti-social act they're involved in _ cheating on tests or using drugs _ which is sometimes the case here," rosenfeld said. "when they see terms like that, their brain waves break into p3 waves." "it's a perfectly valid way of detecting lies," said sidney weinstein, a professor of neurology at new york university college of medicine in new york city and editor of the danbury, conn.-based neuroscience journal. however, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would need a great deal more training, weinstein said.
