in a blow to california and other states with large immigrant populations, the senate voted friday to bar the census bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count. state officials have said california could lose up to $300 million in federal aid if illegal aliens were uncounted. in 1985, before the federal immigration reform act, the number of illegal aliens in orange county was estimated at 229,000, ranking it just behind los angeles county in california, a county official said. thad cochran (r-miss.) said that georgia and indiana both lost house seats after the 1980 census, and that california and new york -- centers of illegal immigration -- each gained seats. the bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted, cochran said. adrian dove, assistant regional director for the u.s. census in charge of outreach, said that despite the senate's decision, the census bureau really doesn't know how to go about finding who was legal or illegal. opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical because the census bureau has already printed questionnaires that do not contain any question about legality of residence.
