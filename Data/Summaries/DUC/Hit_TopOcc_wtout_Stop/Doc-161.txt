ben johnson spent his homecoming in seclusion, without the olympic gold medal and the hero's welcome, as canadians bemoaned the fate of the sprinter who failed the drug test. "i got nothing to hide," johnson told the boston globe during the flight to new york, where he then boarded another plane for canada. stripped of the gold and banned for life from canadian teams, johnson cried in the back of a limousine that whisked him to his mother's home in suburban toronto after the grueling trip from seoul. "there's no gold now, just disappointment," said boyd plaxton, 26, of saskatoon, saskatchewan, one of 200 people on hand when johnson's plane landed. johnson spent the 1 hour, 40 minute flight from new york in the plane's cockpit to avoid reporters. johnson had dedicated his gold to his mother, gloria, and the canadian people. police escorted a woman to the door of johnson's mother's home so she could deliver a card with more than 1,000 signatures from canadians "who sympathized with your personal devastation."
