for example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections. term limitations won't improve the functioning of the legislature, either. term limitations throw away the benefits of learning from experience. inexperienced legislators are less powerful in relation to legislative staff, executive branch bureaucrats and interest-group lobbyists from whom they must learn the customs and routines of legislative operations and the stories behind policy proposals. term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who surround them. finally, term limitations won't enhance representative democracy. more likely, groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term limitations to improve their chances of winning office.
