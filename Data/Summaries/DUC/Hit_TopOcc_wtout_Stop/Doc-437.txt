they're going to begin dying like bloody flies, said ed rist, head of care's east africa unit. even as africa slips into what could become the worst human disaster in its history, there is debate about whether the united states should aggressively intervene or offer assistance with political conditions attached. and a spate of disasters worldwide is sending attention and humanitarian aid elsewhere. interest in a disaster is contingent on media coverage, said alex dewaal, associate director of london-based africa watch. by the time we see the kind of pictures that would motivate people to act, it will be too late, said peter laugharn, coordinator for save the children's horn of africa program. the bill would make it a human rights violation to use food as a weapon, said a staff member. human rights violations outlined in reports by africa watch and amnesty international have led some people to suggest that the united states and united nations should attach conditions to humanitarian aid.
