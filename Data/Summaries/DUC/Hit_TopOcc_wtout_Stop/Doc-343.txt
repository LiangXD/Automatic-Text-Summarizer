the trans-antarctica expedition mr. steger writes about in crossing antarctica (knopf, 304 pages, $25) was born of the ambitions of mr. steger and jean-louis etienne, who met in 1986 in the middle of separate arctic journeys. mr. steger was leading the first confirmed unsupported dog-sled expedition to the north pole and dr. etienne was making the first solo ski there. the success of trans-antarctica owed a lot to the pride, resilience, determination and widely different skills and personalities of the men involved: geoff somers, stubborn, taciturn and wryly humorous, an expert dog-sled driver and veteran of the british antarctic survey victor boyarsky, a boisterous, mercurial, soviet glaciologist keizo funatsu, a quiet, conscientious japanese with spiritual reserves, devoted to his dogs and qin dahe, a dedicated chinese scientist. when i traveled with these men and their dog teams for three days in the minnesota wilderness in february 1989, it was mr. qin's first experience with skis, sled dogs or communicating at length in the english language. dahe will do well, mr. steger decided, a judgment vindicated over 3,741 miles in windchills sometimes approaching minus 100 degrees fahrenheit. dahe will do well, mr. steger decided, a judgment vindicated over 3,741 miles in windchills sometimes approaching minus 100 degrees fahrenheit. mr. steger is also a keen judge of dogs, who share equally in the credit for trans-antarctica.
