since then, my passion really went up, said fujita, a professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes for 42 years and is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the violent storms. fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the university of chicago creating tornadoes for research. he creates tornadoes over a large fan, which makes a swirling motion another fan above simulates a low-pressure system by adding an updraft to the mix. fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado. he also developed the fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes. he also developed the fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes. he also developed the fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes.
