exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker exxon valdez on wednesday as the former captain of the vessel surrendered to authorities in new york to face criminal charges in the massive oil spill. as of wednesday, 12 days after the exxon valdez ran aground, the 240,000-barrel slick was estimated to affect an area the size of delaware, and exxon's fleet of oil-skimming boats had picked up only about 5% of the spilled oil. exxon has failed to provide... the information necessary to make sound planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil and the protection of resources, wrote lynn kent, chief of the state oil and hazardous substance spill response section. the 987-foot ship lifted off the reef three hours earlier than the exxon salvage crew predicted, proceeding without problem under close watch of a flotilla of six tugs and other support craft, including the coast guard cutter rush, to a cove on uninhabited naked island 25 miles to the southwest, where repairs will be made. almost 1 million barrels of oil were pumped from the exxon valdez to three smaller tankers over the last 11 days, and the salvage process began as soon as the last of the tankers left for southern california refineries on tuesday. he added that this technique also would produce a pressurized buffer of clean sea water between the oil left in the tanker -- about 15,000 to 20,000 barrels -- and the once-pristine waters off valdez. the port of valdez was closed at 10 a.m. to clear the iceberg-dotted waters of other vessels as the refloating was attempted and coast guard spokesman bruce pimental said that the vital oil terminal would remain closed until the stricken tanker was safely anchored.
