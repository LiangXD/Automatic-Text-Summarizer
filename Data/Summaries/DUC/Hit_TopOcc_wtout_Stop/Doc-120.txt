charles j. orasin, president of 15-year-old handgun control -- the nra's chief nemesis -- estimates that as many as 500,000 members of the nra and other gun groups regularly lobby elected officials and bureaucrats. deconcini's bill calls for a nationwide ban on sales of ak-47s and eight other semiautomatic rifles -- guns enjoying wide popularity because they have the menacing look and much of the firepower of fully automatic assault weapons used by the military and police. interviewed in his phoenix office as the firestorm was building, a serene deconcini accused the nra of lies and exaggerations about his bill he strongly disputed the nra's claim that a provision banning any gun nearly identical to the nine listed in the measure could be interpreted to cover virtually all semiautomatics. finally, as nra washington lobbyist baker had done in his letter to arizona gun owners, hammer charged that a loosely worded definition in the florida bill would inadvertently ban all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. they called me judas because he had backed a senate leadership team viewed by the nra as sympathetic to controls on handguns and assault weapons. the move was aimed at shattering the nra's claim that only cosmetic differences exist between assault weapons and sporting guns. for the assault-weapons fight, the nra has sent dozens of police officers to washington to offset pro-ban lobbying by police chiefs, launched a national newspaper and tv ad campaign and continued to make available to gun owners a 900 toll phone number that has already produced thousands of nra form letters to president bush and members of congress.
