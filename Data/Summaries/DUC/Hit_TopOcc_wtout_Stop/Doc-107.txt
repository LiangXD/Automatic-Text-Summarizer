"you eliminate all those causes, you're down to arson," said dale smallwood, a criminal investigator for missouri's mark twain national forest. arsonists set 172 of the 296 mark twain fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, smallwood said. on average, smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires each year in missouri are deliberately set. as one of the forest service's 125 special law enforcement agents, smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigating fires in the forests he loves. the forest service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set. mcdonald, who oversees about 125 mark twain employees trained as firefighters, said forest fires cost $25 to $30 an acre to suppress. beyond the cost in dollars of forest fires, there's risk to those who fight them.
