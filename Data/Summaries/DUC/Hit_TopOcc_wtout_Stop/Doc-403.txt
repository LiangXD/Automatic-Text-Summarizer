anderson appeared minutes later on a hospital balcony with joseph cicippio and alann steen, the other two american hostages freed this week. after a daylong delay that u.n. officials attributed to snow-blocked roads, anderson, chief middle east correspondent for the associated press, had appeared wednesday before his colleagues at a press conference in damascus, syria, and said, you can't imagine how glad i am to see you. in his long captivity, anderson had treasured a photo of sulome that his kidnappers allowed him to receive. in washington, president bush, who called anderson in damascus to express the love and admiration that all americans have for terry, said wednesday he joined anderson's family and friends in their happiness for his return to freedom. bush said the united states still wanted a full accounting of all hostages who reportedly have died or been killed in captivity. white house spokesman marlin fitzwater criticized iran, with whom most of the hostage-taking groups had allied themselves, as still a terrorist state, and insisted that the united states had made no deals to gain the release of the u.s. hostages. the good news for the hostage in the statement was brief but meaningful: we're going to free our last captive, terry anderson, thus folding this page in the hostage file before glorious christmas.
