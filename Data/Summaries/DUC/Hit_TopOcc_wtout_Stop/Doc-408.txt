in a voluminous report issued yesterday, the national transportation safety board said these and other incidents carry a clear warning: many foreign-flag cruise ships that sail from u.s. ports have serious safety problems and the potential for a catastrophic accident is significant. foreign-registered vessels make up the vast majority of cruise ships sailing from u.s. ports and catering to americans. but as the booming cruise-ship industry plans ever larger ships -- some on the drawing boards could carry well over 3,000 people -- the safety board's concerns are rising. but the overriding concern, the board said, is that foreign cruise ships are subject to rules that are less stringent and vigorously enforced than those imposed on u.s. flag vessels. but almost all cruise ships operating out of the continental u.s. sail under foreign flags, and the u.s. coast guard conducts only cursory inspections of foreign vessels. at least 80 foreign cruise ships operate out of u.s. ports, mostly from southern florida. to reduce the chances of a cruise-ship disaster, the safety board is pushing for legislation that would give the u.s. coast guard the authority to enforce u.s. safety rules on foreign-flag vessels.
