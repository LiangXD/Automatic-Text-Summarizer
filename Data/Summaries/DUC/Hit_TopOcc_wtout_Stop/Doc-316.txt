michael milken, the drexel burnham lambert junk bond wizard in beverly hills who revolutionized u.s. corporate finance and raised funds for dozens of corporate raids, was indicted wednesday on federal racketeering, insider trading and other securities fraud counts. the long-expected indictment also named milken's brother, lowell milken, and a former drexel trader, bruce l. newberg. if convicted on the racketeering charges, the three could face an astronomical amount in financial penalties: the indictment asks that they forfeit a total of $1.85 billion, representing their salaries, other compensation and their share of drexel profits, all earned in what the government charges was a continuing criminal enterprise operated at the new york-based investment banking firm. sources at the firm said the indictment of michael milken probably would clear the way for drexel to swiftly settle civil charges filed by the securities and exchange commission. the 110-page indictment returned wednesday appears to closely follow the civil charges contained in an sec lawsuit filed in september against drexel and the milkens. the indictment notes that milken received $1.1 billion in direct compensation from drexel from 1984 through 1987, as well as millions in other forms of compensation, and that he is drexel's largest individual stockholder, owning about 6% of the firm. drexel's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges pending against the firm calls for it to withhold nearly all of michael milken's compensation from 1988, as well as about $13 million owed to lowell milken.
