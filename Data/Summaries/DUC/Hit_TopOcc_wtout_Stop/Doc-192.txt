yasser arafat on tuesday accused the united states of threatening to kill plo officials if palestinian guerrillas attack american targets. the state department said in washington that it had received reports the plo might target americans because of alleged u.s. involvement in the assassination of khalil wazir, the plo's second in command. there have been accusations by the plo that the united states knew about and approved plans for slaying wazir. arafat, the palestine liberation organization leader, claimed the threat to kill plo officials was made in a u.s. government document the plo obtained from an arab government. in washington, assistant secretary of state richard murphy denied arafat's accusation that the united states threatened plo officials. state department spokesman charles redman said the united states has been in touch with a number of middle eastern countries about possible plo attacks against american citizens and facilities. "it has come to our attention that the plo leader yasser arafat may have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks against american citizens and facilities abroad, possibly in retaliation for last month's assassination of abu jihad.
