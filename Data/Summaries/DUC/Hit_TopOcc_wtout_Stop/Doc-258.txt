but drought aid cut farmers' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a north dakota state university study found. disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other drought-ravaged states, including iowa, illinois, minnesota and wisconsin. disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into iowa's economy, an iowa state university study said. "it has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster," said dwight aakre, a north dakota state economist. despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the state still needs "a good year to get back on our feet," hauck said. in fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12 months ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988's estimated $530 million, aakre said. about $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms in cass county, the state's leader in crop acres.
