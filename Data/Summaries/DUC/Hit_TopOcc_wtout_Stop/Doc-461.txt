just as he said in his article, the reason is that what he has done since he became governor of hong kong has been criticized and condemned not only by china and people of hong kong, but also by people in britain. but for the hong kong people, of course the hong kong chinese, what should be put first is certainly that they should be treated as real chinese people of china rather than a conquered people in a colony, and the first responsibility of britain is to ensure a smooth return of hong kong to china in accordance with the sino-british joint declaration. in fact, responsibility toward the citizens of hong kong advocated by chris patten is actually for the colonialist interests of the british empire. people will also ask: why will the position of britain in china and asia be decided by how britain discharges its responsibility in hong kong in a dignified manner? if britain ensures a smooth return of hong kong to china in accordance with the sino-british joint declaration, is it not a practice in a dignified manner? does britain really want to return hong kong to china only in name while preserving its position as the governor to show the power and prestige of the british empire and go on playing the tyrant in china and asia as a colonialist? chris patten, the last governor of hong kong, has been trying hard to preserve an actual colonial position in hong kong and revitalize the colonialist power and prestige of the old british empire.
