a poor ventilation system that does little more than recycle old, stale air from one end of the building to another. the evidence comes from various studies of tuberculosis, measles and flu that spread in a manner that can only be explained by poor air ventilation. the building's ventilation system permitted circulation of some outdoor air -- 15 cubic feet per minute -- a low level commonly found in buildings since the 1930s. in the study, nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis. other studies have documented: (check) flu spreads quickly on airplanes where ventilation systems consist entirely of recirculated air. nardell and others recognize that the solution to this problem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air -- can be expensive. in his tuberculosis study, he found that the biggest benefit comes from improving the worst ventilation systems that allow very little fresh air.
