perez de cuellar, who oversaw the negotiations for the release of western hostages, said in new york that anderson was with syrian officials in lebanon's bekaa valley, and heavy snow has delayed his transfer to damascus. earlier today, it was not clear where anderson was, despite reports from arab and u.s. officials that he was released and turned over to the syrians. at the white house, spokesman marlin fitzwater said u.s. officials had no official word that reports of anderson's release were true. eight other westerners have been freed since august, when the united nations launched negotiations involving a complex swap of western hostages, hundreds of arabs held by israel, and information about missing israeli servicemen. in exchange for the hostage releases, the kidnappers were reported by iran's tehran radio this week to have been promised that they would not be pursued by the united states, germany or any other country. the u.n. negotiations for the western hostages are expected to ultimately involve freedom for 300 arab prisoners held by israel and its proxy militia in lebanon. on sunday, israel released 25 arab prisoners, bringing to 91 the number set free since august and giving new impetus to hostage releases.
