thomas and his brother made it in the white world. i was raised to survive under the totalitarianism of segregation, thomas wrote in a paper for the heritage foundation, a conservative public policy institute in washington. the very beliefs that have brought thomas to the steps of the u.s. supreme court make him suspect to black political activists, veterans of the struggle to make government accountable for the wrongs done to blacks. yet as washington post journalist juan williams has pointed out, thomas is firmly grounded in the black intellectual tradition of booker t. washington, who advocated education, self-reliance and mutual support as the principal means of advancement. he later joined monsanto co. thomas' introduction to washington came in 1979. in 1982, after a year as assistant education secretary for civil rights, thomas was named by president reagan to lead the equal employment opportunity commission. but the hearings went smoothly, perhaps because thomas was never among the reagan administration's most outspoken critics of civil rights.
