keating's contributions have come under increased scrutiny since his company, american continental corp. of phoenix, filed for protection from creditors in u.s. bankruptcy court on april 13 and lincoln savings &amp loan, its principal subsidiary, was seized by federal regulators the next day. as evidence, they cite donations of about $300,000 to five u.s. senators who went to bat in april, 1987, for keating in two unusual private meetings with savings and loan regulators. 'concerned' about seizure and one of those senators, democrat alan cranston of california, said friday that he intervened again a month ago by urging federal regulators to allow keating to sell his embattled s&amp l to a group headed by former republican rep. the next day, federal regulators seized lincoln, claiming that keating and american continental were operating the s&amp l in an unsafe and unsound manner. congressmen from arizona also have fared well, including jon kyl (r-ariz.), who has received $20,950 while representing the district keating lives in. * more than $52,000 has gone to the two california senators -- cranston and republican pete wilson -- who represent lincoln's home base. keating was born in ohio, and american continental is incorporated there. * nearly $166,000 has gone to 11 members of the senate and house banking committees, where deregulation of the savings and loan industry was conceived and implemented in recent years, much to the dismay of some regulators. one former executive of an american continental subsidiary who requested anonymity said he made his only political donation ever -- $500 -- in 1987 because he was made aware by keating that sen.
