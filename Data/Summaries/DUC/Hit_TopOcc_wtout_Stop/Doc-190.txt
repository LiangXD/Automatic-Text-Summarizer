based on the new findings, mr. gray predicted earlier this summer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be above average, and so far he seems to be right. mr. gray said the west african sahel region is the newest of five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane activity. mr. gray said his research, published in the current issue of science, suggests that intense caribbean hurricanes gilbert, joan and hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of this change. comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the sahel with the number of high-powered atlantic hurricanes, mr. gray found a striking correlation. from 1947 to 1969, for instance, rainfall in the western sahel was especially abundant, and during this time there were 13 severe hurricanes that formed in the atlantic ocean. mr. gray searched back in recent history and found that the sahel, which includes parts of senegal, mauritania, mali and gambia, goes through long periods of alternating dry and wet weather. mr. gray predicted that, based on historical cycles, the sahel is entering a wet period.
