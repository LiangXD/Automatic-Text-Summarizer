solar eclipses occur twice a year, when the sun, moon and earth line up. because of variations in the moon's orbit, fewer than a third of the solar eclipses are total eclipses. but when the shadow's narrow path does cross inhabited areas, people flock there to experience totality -- to watch the light snap off and the stars snap on, and to gaze at the sun's shaggy corona hanging in the dark sky for a few minutes before daylight abruptly returns. also, its 150-mile-wide path across hawaii, baja california, mexico city and four central american capital cities puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history, says alan dyer, an editor of astronomy magazine. historic events for science, two eclipses have proved especially historic: in 1868, spectroscopic study of the sun's halo turned up evidence of a new element, which was named helium, from helios, the greek sun god. but in recent years solar eclipses have declined in significance for researchers. solar wind studies at some observatories, astronomers will take repeated photographs of the corona during the eclipse to study it close up and to watch for material accelerating outward to become solar wind.
