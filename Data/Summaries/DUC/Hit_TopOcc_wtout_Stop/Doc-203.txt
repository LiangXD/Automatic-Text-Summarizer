but the lack of a high-speed rail link to london, and improved service beyond, means britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits. european rail link ltd., a consortium formed last november to build the rail link, had asked the government to contribute #350 million towards the total #2.6 billion cost of the link. as a result of thursday's decision, the journey time to london from paris will be about three hours -- 30 minutes longer than with a high-speed rail link. eurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable without the high-speed rail link. the tunnel-building consortium argues that only 39% of its total revenue will come from direct london-to-paris trains the real money-spinner will be freight traffic hauled by road to the tunnel, then loaded onto special eurotunnel wagons for the journey under the channel. some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services. if you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links.
