skiers have mountain ranges, tennis players have resorts, why can't a runner take a marathon vacation? said thorn gilligan, president of marathon tours in boston. in addition to air fare and hotel, runners are guaranteed spots in restricted entry races such as the london marathon. most marathons take you through cities, so you get a chance to see things you'd never see on a sightseeing bus, said fred lebow, president of the new york roadrunner's club and director of the new york marathon. lebow has run in 32 marathons, including london, paris, rome, stockholm, iceland, seoul and vienna. but it isn't necessary to run 26.2 miles to go on a running vacation, especially if it's a family trip. some marathons, like portland's, include additional races: a five-mile run, a five-mile walk and a kids run. tel aviv has a half-marathon and a fun run.
