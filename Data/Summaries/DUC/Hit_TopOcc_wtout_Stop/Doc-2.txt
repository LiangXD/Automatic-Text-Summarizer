the government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. the suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement. the government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in june, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans. because of the disease, the u.s. department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service in july banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from britain, said margaret webb, a usda spokeswoman in washington. david maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of bse hysteria in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is remote. it is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of bse on human health, a consultative committee reported to the agriculture ministry. the committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a shrewd guess that bse is transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.
