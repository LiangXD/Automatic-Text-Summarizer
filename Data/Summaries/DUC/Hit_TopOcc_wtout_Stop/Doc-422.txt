las vegas has grown from a dusty town of a few resorts into a booming metropolis of more than 600,000 people, with nearly 60,000 hotel and motel rooms to accomodate tourists. nearly 20,000 new hotel rooms either are under construction or awaiting groundbreaking, as resorts compete to add rooms they hope will bring in even more tourists and gamblers in the near future. visitor volume nearly has doubled in the last 12 years, with an estimated 17 million tourists each expected to spend an average of 2-3 days in las vegas during 1988. already boasting the world's two largest resort hotels, las vegas soon will have five hotel-casinos with more than 3,000 rooms apiece. when finished sometime late next year, the $550 million resort will have 3,200 guest rooms set in a watery tropical setting that hotel officials claim will be like nothing las vegas has ever seen. part of the las vegas lure also comes from room rates that average $45 a night, far below the $100 or more charged by non-gaming hotels in other cities. the city's hotels in the past four to five years have begun exploiting the vast middle-class and tourism markets they once eschewed in favor of attracting a handful of high-rolling gamblers.
