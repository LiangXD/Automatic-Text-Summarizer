after seven long years, the us congress this week passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations of mr robert kennedy and rev martin luther king jr in 1968. the legislation - known as the brady bill after mr james brady, the former white house press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on president ronald reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on purchases of handguns. advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over stubborn resistance by republican senators from western states such as idaho and alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the us. despite its uncertain effect, passage of the brady bill is read by some as a sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control. paradoxically, while thousands of people have been telephoning their republican senators to demand that they stop blocking the brady bill, thousands have also been flocking to join the national rifle association, the leading organisation among the pro-gun lobbies. in virginia, meanwhile, ms mary sue terry, the democratic candidate for governor, relied in her campaign on gun control and was thrashed by mr george allen, her republican opponent, who did not favour tighter curbs but promised to be tough on criminals by abolishing parole. such beliefs have led the nra to campaign against restrictions on machine guns, assault weapons and armour-piercing bullets.
