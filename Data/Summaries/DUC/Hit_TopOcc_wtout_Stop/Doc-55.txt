this is the question the house of representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the family welfare reform act of 1987. the bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients. that conclusion was presumably the basis for the bipartisan consensus that was going to produce a serious welfare-reform bill this year. in fact, while the level of afdc benefits has decreased in real terms since 1970, the total level of all welfare benefits has not. together, spending for the seven major welfare programs (those just mentioned plus the women, infants and children program and the low income energy assistance program) has actually increased since 1970 by 232% in constant dollars, to an annual total $65.7 billion. the house democrats' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious. it is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the family welfare reform act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency.
