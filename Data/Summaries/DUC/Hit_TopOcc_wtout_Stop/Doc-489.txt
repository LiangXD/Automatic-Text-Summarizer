the allegations of misrepresentation involve a device that removes carbon dioxide from the air and turns it into a solid for storage inside the biosphere. carbon dioxide is exhaled by humans and metabolized by plants. the voice also said the levels of carbon dioxide in biosphere 2 were becoming dangerously high, apparently because of the decrease in sunlight and the resulting decline in photosynthetic activity by the plants. kathleen dyhr, a biosphere spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview that the group had indeed installed a carbon dioxide remover. the carbon dioxide levels were currently fine, she added, though higher than outside the closed environment. from the start, when planning for the biosphere got under way in the mid-1980s, it was billed as a futuristic experiment in closed recycling where plants and animals would provide each other with all the essentials for life. most especially, green plants would take human wastes (urine, feces and carbon dioxide) and turn them into oxygen, water and food for human consumption.
