critics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not -- it's wrong to blame congress for the now nearly 100% re-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for. michael kinsley writes in the new republic that if incumbents always win, it's because voters can't be bothered. that takes money, and skewed campaign finance laws combined with taxpayer-paid junk mail effectively mean that only incumbents have the cash to make themselves known and to be taken seriously by the media. some complain that limiting terms would infringe on democracy by not allowing voters to elect whom they please. the polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way they can control congress effectively is by limiting terms. getting incumbents to reduce the advantages they have voted themselves is something like asking banks to leave their vaults unlocked. the opinion polls for term limitation show that the voters don't like the change.
