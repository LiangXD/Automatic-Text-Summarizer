there was no immediate reaction to the slovenian declaration from federal authorities or from rival serbia. monday's parliamentary declaration provides for establishing an independent legal system that would take precedence over federal laws and for slovenian control over armed forces stationed in the republic, state media said. the media said a joint session of the republic's 240-seat legislature voted unanimously to adopt the declaration of sovereignty of the state of slovenia. a coalition of center-right parties formed a new government last month in slovenia, the most prosperous of yugoslavia's six republics, after trouncing reform communists in the first free state elections held in communist-ruled yugoslavia in 45 years. they threaten that slovenia will declare full independence from yugoslavia if the remaining republics do not accept its proposals for a confederation. premier lojze peterle and other slovenian leaders also say slovenia should take urgent steps to join the european community, no matter what yugoslavia's communist-ruled southern states say. the slovenian declaration also said police should take over control of frontiers with neighboring italy and austria, replacing border guards deployed for the past 45 years by yugoslavia's communist government, ljubljana tv said.
