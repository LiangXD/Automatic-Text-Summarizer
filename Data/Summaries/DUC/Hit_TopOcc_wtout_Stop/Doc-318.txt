junk bond wizard michael milken officially ended his 20-year career at drexel burnham lambert inc. on thursday and said he will launch his own financial consulting firm while he awaits trial on racketeering and securities fraud charges. 'very emotional experience' the timing of milken's resignation appears to have been influenced by a supreme court decision last week that cleared the way for drexel to complete its announced plan to settle civil insider-trading and securities fraud charges brought by the securities and exchange commission. milken's brother, lowell milken, 39, also resigned thursday from drexel. lowell milken had been a lawyer with the los angeles firm of irell &amp manella before he left in 1978 to help his brother run drexel's junk bond department. 'naturally disappointed' milken started out in 1969 as a part-time employee at drexel harriman, a philadelphia investment firm that was a precursor to drexel burnham lambert, while attending the university of pennsylvania's wharton school of business. 'more demands than ever' friends of milken's have speculated that one reason he decided to start a new firm now is that, since taking a leave of absence from drexel, he has had an unaccustomed amount of time on his hands. sources confirmed thursday that another former drexel employee, reed harmon, who had worked closely with milken, was recently granted immunity in exchange for testimony before a grand jury.
