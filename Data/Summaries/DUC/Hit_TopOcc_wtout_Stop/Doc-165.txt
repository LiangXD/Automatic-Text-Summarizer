the tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, exxon shipping co. said sunday. the coast guard said the slick and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of about 100 square miles. the 987-foot tanker exxon valdez, carrying 1.2 million barrels of north slope crude oil loaded at valdez, ran onto a reef 25 miles from the port early friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice. more than four miles of floating boom had been placed in an effort to contain the oil, the coast guard said sunday. however, exxon insisted that the area was only 10 to 12 square miles, and coast guard officials said they were at a loss to explain the difference in estimates. by late sunday, exxon officials said a total of 37,500 barrels of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation, leaving more than 900,000 barrels on the ship. an experiment to assess the possibility of burning off the oil was completed early sunday and the coast guard said exxon officials were "cautiously optimistic."
