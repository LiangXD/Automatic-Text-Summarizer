a 1987 state constitutional amendment broadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felons may own guns, a judge ruled. cumberland county superior court justice stephen l. perkins on friday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felon against edward brown of cumberland. prosecutors had argued that the amendment's backers did not intend to allow felons to own guns, but the judge said nothing in the amendment indicated such an intent. "if maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict or qualify the right to keep and bear arms, they could have enacted a constitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions," perkins wrote. "maine's right to keep and bear arms amendment is the most broad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar state amendments," he wrote. the amendment declared, "every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms,and this right shall never be questioned." perkins denied a motion to dismiss the criminal threatening charge, but threw out the gun possession charge, saying "there is simply no rational connection" between brown's previous conviction and his ownership of a firearm.
