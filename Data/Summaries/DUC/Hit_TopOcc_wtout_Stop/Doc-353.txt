claiming support from iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz, a soviet spokesman said the plan envisioned a total withdrawal within 21 days of a cessation of hostilities. there was no immediate response from the iraqi president, and fitzwater said that based on the oil-field destruction, there was not much reason for optimism that saddam was ready to quit the war. shortly after bush issued the allied ultimatum, a soviet spokesman in moscow announced a new six-point set of provisions he said were agreed to by aziz for a withdrawal from kuwait. the provisions include iraqi withdrawal from kuwait within 21 days of a cease-fire and supervision of the withdrawal by the united nations, vitaly ignatenko said. ignatenko said the plan had been passed on to baghdad and that a final response to it from the iraqi leadership was anticipated. bush's statement was his first public response to a soviet-brokered peace plan -- an effort the president said he appreciated, even while he declared that it attached unacceptable conditions on an iraqi withdrawal. the original soviet-iraqi peace plan followed days of diplomacy between moscow and baghdad.
