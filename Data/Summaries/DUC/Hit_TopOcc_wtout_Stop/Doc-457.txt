the sharp deterioration in relations between britain and china over hong kong's political future has cast a pall over the colony's financial markets. relations between the uk and china have deteriorated markedly since mr patten, with the general support of the hong kong people, announced proposals on october 7 for elections in 1994 and 1995 which would allow for greater, though still limited, democracy in choosing local leaders. since then, the governor has repeatedly held out the possibility that he will proceed with his plans even in the face of opposition from china - marking a change in british policy towards hong kong and china. on friday, lu ping, china's top official on hong kong affairs, said beijing would challenge the validity of future elections and abrogate agreements to build the colony's multi-billion dollar airport if mr patten proceeded without china's agreement. the proposals, which mr patten believes are consistent with anglo-chinese agreements and chinese law, provide for a greater, though still restricted, application of democracy in the conduct of future elections. the government is bracing itself for a further onslaught on mr patten's plans from the colony's pro-beijing press. mr patten has said, however, that what he finally proposes has to be 'acceptable to the people of hong kong'.
