the demonstrators, most associated with operation rescue, have charged and testified that police tactics used during the past 2 1/2 years in cities such as denver, atlanta, pittsburgh and los angeles have resulted in serious injury and led to sexual abuse against women who have been arrested. but government agencies, the press and civil libertarians have reacted quite differently to operation rescue videos showing apparent police brutality and to reports of police abuse of hundreds of the activists across the country. the settlement over police use of nunchakus in los angeles, like the videos and photographs showing police using pain compliance techniques on rescue participants, received little attention from the public, civil rights groups or the press. it (police abuse) has not attracted much attention because a lot of people are not sympathetic to operation rescue, said dr. james fyfe, a professor of justice at american university in washington, d.c. police may also have a predisposition to use excessive force against the anti-abortion activists, said fyfe, a former new york city policeman. colleen o'connor, the american civil liberties union's national public education director, and carol sobel, the aclu's senior staff counsel in los angeles, said they agree that police have abused operation rescue participants. the aclu may support some of operation rescue's claims of police brutality, but sobel said it also has won a $110,000 judgment in a case in which the aclu had obtained an injunction against the anti-abortion group. the civil rights commission in 1989, under pressure from some members of congress, decided against an investigation of alleged police brutality against anti-abortion activists and decided not to ask the justice department to investigate.
