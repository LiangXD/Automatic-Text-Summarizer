the northwest airlines jet that crashed sunday in detroit, killing at least 154 people, was involved in two incidents of engine failure in the past two years. in april, the national transportation safety board urged the faa to conduct a safety investigation of the 200 series of jt8d engines after some dangerous in-flight engine failures. the board made the recommendation after a march 23 incident in which an american airlines md-82 plane approaching the minneapolis airport experienced an engine surge and loss of power. in its april report, the national transportation safety board warned that many of the 330 md-80 series airplanes operated by 12 u.s. and 14 foreign airlines world-wide are potential candidates for engine failure. faa officials at the crash scene wouldn't speculate on the reasons for the crash or comment on the plane's engines. a northwest spokesman said the engines involved in those two incidents had since been replaced by other jt8d-200 series engines. faa records show that besides those incidents that involved the plane that crashed, problems with the turbine sections of jt8d-200 series engines occurred on three republic flights in the past four years.
