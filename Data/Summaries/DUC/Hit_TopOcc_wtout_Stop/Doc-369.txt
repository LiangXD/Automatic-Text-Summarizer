robert h. bork, who once hoped for a supreme court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court monday. he was there in the capacity of a lawyer _ apparently making him the first defeated supreme court nominee ever to argue before the justices. the senate rejected bork's nomination to the high court in 1987 after a bitter political battle. there were no references to that fight monday as bork engaged in debate with the justices and opposing lawyers over the complexities of federal banking law and related matters. justice anthony m. kennedy, who occupies the seat that eluded bork, directed a few questions at bork. bork, 63, a former federal appeals court judge, is a fellow at the american enterprise institute and will begin teaching constitutional law in the fall at the george mason university law school in arlington, va. bork was only the sixth man this century to be denied a supreme court seat by the senate and the 26th in its history.
