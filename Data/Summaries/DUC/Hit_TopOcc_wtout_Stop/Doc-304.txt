washington -- by choosing clarence thomas, a conservative black federal judge, for the supreme court, president bush may have defused a fierce political battle over the high court's shift to the right. judge thomas, who has been sitting on the federal appeals court in washington for just 14 months, won't be confirmed without a fight in the senate focusing on his inexperience on the bench and his strong opposition to affirmative action. judge thomas's nomination yesterday got a restrained reaction from many senate democrats. while liberals will focus on judge thomas's legal inexperience, his record on the bench doesn't present them with the sort of target they had with the articulated, sharply conservative legal views of robert bork, whose supreme court nomination was defeated in 1987. a number of senate democrats, including judiciary chairman joseph biden of delaware, stressed when judge thomas was confirmed for the appeals court that he would face tougher scrutiny if he were nominated for the supreme court. after two years in the monsanto co. legal department, judge thomas rejoined mr. danforth, by then a u.s. senator. judge thomas, who just turned 43 last week, would be the youngest supreme court justice of the past 100 years with the exception of william o. douglas, who joined the court when he was 40.
