with the u.s. just beginning to convey a massive military force to the persian gulf region, iraqi ruler saddam hussein has a window of opportunity of about that much time to freely deploy his formidable army, possibly unleash his vast chemical-weapons stockpile and test whether the west's ships really intend to blockade his oil shipments. according to industry and other sources, the iraqis may be using the ship to force a confrontation with a powerful u.s. naval force situated near the port. the u.s. hasn't formally declared a blockade, but u.s. forces are unlikely to simply let the iraqi ship pass. the president stressed that u.s. troops are intended to defend the saudi kingdom, not to drive iraq out of kuwait. the president said he hopes to free kuwait through economic pressure on saddam hussein, which continued to mount as the world's oil-consuming nations -- and, just as importantly, many of its leading oil producers -- joined together in a campaign to cut off iraqi oil without causing global economic dislocation. it remained unclear precisely what force the u.s. is dispatching to meet the 100,000 or more heavily-armored iraqi troops massed on kuwait's border. the army's saudi games began more than ten years ago, when u.s. and saudi officials began to worry that soviet armored forces could quickly sweep down through iran or iraq and take the oil fields.
