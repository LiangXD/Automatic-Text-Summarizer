as yellowstone national park's research biologist, he has already begun to monitor the forest's rebirth from the worst fire on record. the national park service has already been at the center of a much-publicized political firestorm over its 16-year-old natural burn policy, which allows lightning-caused fires to burn themselves out, except where they threaten towns or park buildings. mr. despain has set up or is planning several long-term research projects to study the effects of this year's fires. fires have been an integral force in the yellowstone ecosystem for the past 10,000 years since the glaciers left, mr. varley says. for the first five years after a fire, while surrounding vegetation is still relatively low, there will be a proliferation of wildflowers in the park, she says. aspen trees, whose paper-white bark and yellow leaves punctuate the evergreen forests this time of year, also thrive after a fire. wyoming's u.s. senators, republicans malcolm wallop and alan k. simpson, are mindful of the damage the fires caused the state's tourist industry this year, as well as the threat to gateway towns near the park.
