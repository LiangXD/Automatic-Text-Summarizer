this week's flare-up of western wildfires can't hold a candle to the damage wrought by last year's record-breaking fire season, but officials say a dry august could change everything. fire has charred more than 1.3 million acres of forest and range land since january in the contiguous united states, compared to 2.1 million acres by this time last year, fire officials said monday. nearly 10,000 firefighters in five western states are battling hundreds of blazes, most of them sparked last week by lightning. fire is a natural part of western forest and range land. one of the hardest-hit areas was yellowstone national park, where fire blackened about 1 million acres, nearly half the park's territory. by year's end, 6 million acres had burned in the west and alaska, making 1988 the worst fire season in 30 years, and, in terms of firefighting resources committed, the most expensive in u.s. history, sacher said. fire danger is high this week in parts of oregon, nevada and idaho, the national weather service said monday.
