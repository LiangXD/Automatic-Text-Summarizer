late last night, pentagon officials said that contact between u.s. and iraqi tanks had been light, and it was too early to tell what strategy the guards would adopt. more broadly, u.s. commanders reported yesterday that allied forces have destroyed or rendered ineffective 21 iraqi divisions, more than half the total in and around kuwait. for starters, the u.s. hopes that the iraqi people themselves will conclude that saddam hussein botched both his war with the u.s.-led coalition and his various attempts to stop it once it was underway. while the tank battles began to the west, allied forces continued to consolidate positions around kuwait city, amid numerous reports from u.s. soldiers and kuwaiti citizens that nearly all of the iraqi troops already have pulled out. rear admiral mike mcconnell, director of intelligence for the joint chiefs, said that allied forces found a document, which he said was written to iraq's senior generals before the war started, ordering iraqi troops to inflict maximum casualties on u.s. troops and also to destroy kuwaiti oil facilities. to the south, allied forces continued to consolidate positions around kuwait city, amid numerous reports from u.s. soldiers and kuwaiti citizens that nearly all of the iraqi troops already have pulled out. overall, pentagon officials described iraqi forces as confused, leaderless and battle-weary, adding that the few guard units that have engaged in tank duels so far haven't been any tougher to defeat than the rest of saddam hussein's army.
