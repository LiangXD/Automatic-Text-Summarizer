biosphere ii is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural proclivity of water. it then flows through the plains and grasslands of the savanna, down to the 25-foot deep ocean with its coral reef and then to the salt and freshwater marshes, drying up before it reaches the desert. the water-laden air then is drawn and climbs the mountain where natural cooling and condensing coils bring it down as rain and dew to feed the stream again. so dr. tony burgess of the university of arizona patterned the deserts after those of baja california where the cactus and other plants have learned to live with ocean fog. the rain forest and its towering mountain and stream are the design of dr. ghillean prance, director of the kew royal botanical gardens of london in association with the new york botanical garden. dr. peter warshall of the university of arizona patterned the savanna grasslands after those of south america, australia and africa. plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands in biosphere ii.
