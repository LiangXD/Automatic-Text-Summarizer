the us treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector. mr preston's first challenge, says mr mistry, will be to wrest control of the bank from messrs stern and qureshi his second, to prune legions of 'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience. 'the bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,' concludes mr richard feinberg, director of the overseas development council in washington. as incoming president, mr preston must review the bank's strategies for promoting development. according to mr lawrence summers, the bank's chief economist, net transfers over the next five years will be about dollars 2 per person in the developing world compared with dollars 9 (in current prices) in the late 1970s. the world bank operates under very different rules: its charter requires it to be non-political and only its small affiliate, the international finance corporation (ifc), can make direct loans to private businesses. mr summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.
