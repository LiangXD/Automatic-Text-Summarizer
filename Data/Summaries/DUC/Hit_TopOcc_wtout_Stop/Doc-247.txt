jezersko, yugoslavia -- on wednesday, the slovene soldiers manning this border post raised a new flag to mark slovenia's independence from yugoslavia. less than two days after slovenia and croatia, two of yugoslavia's six republics, unilaterally seceded from the nation, the federal government in belgrade mobilized troops to regain control. but the poorly trained and equipped slovene and croatian militias, formed in the past several months, are no match for the 180,000-strong federal army. so far, no foreign countries have recognized slovenian and croatian independence. in a letter to slovenia's premier, gen. konrad kolsek of the federal military district that controls slovenia said he had orders to seize all border crossings and would crush any resistence. the nationalist governments of slovenia and croatia have been demanding a looser confederation of sovereign republics. together, slovenia, with two million people, and croatia, with five million, supply nearly two-thirds of yugoslavia's foreign exchange and about half of the country's gross national product.
