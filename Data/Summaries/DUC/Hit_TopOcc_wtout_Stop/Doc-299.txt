yesterday's marks the third crash of a united jet in the past three years. in july 1988, a united dc-10 crashed in sioux city, iowa, after an engine broke apart in flight, killing 112 people. about two hours before yesterday's crash, the national weather service in colorado springs issued its first high wind warning for the area since january, according to james hall, a meteorological technician observer in colorado springs. moments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23 miles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, mr. hall said. another faa official said that although it is too early to pinpoint the cause, wind shear would be a major area of investigation. if preliminary reports that there was wind shear in the area are true, then that would indicate there was some instability in the atmosphere, he added. the last major u.s. wind shear accident occurred in dallas in 1985, when a delta air lines jet crashed on approach.
