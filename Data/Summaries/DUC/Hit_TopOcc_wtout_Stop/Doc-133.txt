patience was its own virtue in the long beach marathon sunday, as the men's and women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take a toll on the runners. run as a race within a race was the pacific rim marathon, which consists of teams from invited countries. wilson and yanmin won both the long beach marathon and the pacific rim race, for total prize money of $9,500 each. the men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners. yanmin had to come from behind for her victory, giving the women's race an exciting finish. as happened in the men's race, the runners in the lead pack ebbed and eventually faded. two soviet runners -- irina ruban and tatiana zueva -- who had run side-by-side in third and fourth place throughout the race, faded.
