men who smoke heavily are nearly twice as likely as nonsmokers to die from a common form of leukemia, concludes a report by the university of edinburgh. the balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia, dr. wald wrote in an accompanying commentary on the analysis, which was conducted by university of edinburgh epidemiologist leo kinlen. dr. kinlen, who directs the university's cancer epidemiology unit, examined leukemia deaths from a u.s. study that had tracked veterans' smoking between 1954 and 1969. dr. kinlen found veterans who had smoked more than 21 cigarettes a day were the most likely to die from myeloid leukemia, the most common form of the disease in middle-aged people. and men using fewer than 10 cigarettes daily were 31% more likely to die from leukemia than nonsmokers, according to the report. previous studies have observed higher death rates from leukemia among smokers, but either involved fewer patients or didn't compare amounts smoked with incidence of the disease. for this reason, leukemia has in general not been regarded as a a malignancy related to smoking, dr. kinlen wrote.
