exxon officials monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of alaskan coastline fouled by the nation's largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a suspension of local environmental laws. the plan makes no provisions for continuing the cleanup beyond mid-september, and notes that 191 miles of lightly oiled coastline may not be cleaned mechanically at all, but be allowed to be washed naturally by the environment. the oil company's strategy, which was submitted to state and federal authorities only hours before a deadline expired, divides alaska's oil-tainted shores into four categories _ from the most heavily polluted to those that are "only lightly oiled." 15. exxon's plan calls for the recovered waste to be strained for usable oil that can be refined, and said the oil-laced wastewater could be treated at the alyeska pipeline service co.'s disposal plant in valdez. before the plan was released, yost said he wanted much more detail than exxon's original cleanup plan, which included nothing on polluted areas outside the sound. meanwhile, tar and sludge from the valdez spill fouled the beaches of alaska's wild katmai national park, drenching hundreds of sea otters and birds and threatening the huge brown bears prowling the refuge. exxon also received sharp criticism from the federal government, which accused the company of "foot-dragging" in the construction of a second facility in seward to aid in the cleanup of sea otters fouled by the oil.
