investors are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the river limpopo in zimbabwe, which de beers, the south african group that dominates the diamond business, discovered but then let get away. de beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to concentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the heat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in south africa. mr robin baxter-brown, chairman of redaurum red lake mines, one of the new joint owners of river ranch, said yesterday that de beers bulldozed the site before leaving. mr baxter-brown is a south african geologist who started his career with de beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience. the deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m tonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in march last year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them of gem quality, mr baxter-brown said. the joint venturers have exclusive exploration rights to 13,474 hectares of ground around the mine and mr baxter-brown suggested the chances of finding another diamond deposit were good. while most of river ranch's gem diamonds are small, typically under half a carat, the mine has yielded some big stones, the biggest so far being 29.6 carats.
