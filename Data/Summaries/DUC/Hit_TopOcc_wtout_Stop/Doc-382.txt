the same situation applies if your boss has a polygraph examiner come into the warehouse tomorrow to hook wires to randomly selected employees and question them about merchandise missing from the company's shelves. these restrictions on lie detectors, whose accuracy has long been under attack, are enumerated in a federal law that took effect tuesday, six months after it was signed by president reagan. "we expect that the new law will ban 80 percent of the approximately 2 million polygraph tests given annually," goldberg said in a prepared statement. the law's restrictions will be felt most heavily in 28 states that lack their own statutes restricting the use of lie detectors, goldberg said. an employer can request an employee to take a lie detector test if the worker had access to missing or damaged material and if the employer sets forth in a written statement a reasonable suspicion that the worker was involved in the loss. goldberg said employers in the following states, which allow businesses to request people to take lie detector tests, could be affected by the new law: california, hawaii, idaho, maryland, montana, nebraska, pennsylvania and wisconsin. the remaining 14 states and the district of columbia have laws banning polygraph examinations for employment purposes, and these laws take precedence over the new federal statute if they are more restrictive, according to goldberg.
