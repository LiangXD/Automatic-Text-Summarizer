president carlos salinas de gortari has appointed a cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as "the slar eclipse of the century" on july 11. posters have been placed in mexico city subways promoting the event, and resorts along the eclipse's path are scrambling to accommodate the expected rush of tourists. the eclipse path reaches from hawaii through mexico to brazil. the 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes, the maximum length for a total solar eclipse. the commission bills the northwestern state of baja california sur as the best place to watch because the state has an average of 300 cloudless days a year. baja california sur alone plans to spend $26.5 million for public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in millions more from tourism. most hotels along the eclipse route are full for july 11.
