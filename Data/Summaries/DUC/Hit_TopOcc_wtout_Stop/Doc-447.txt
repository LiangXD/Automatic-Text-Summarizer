the successful forecast points up just how far the science of volcanoes has come in the past decade. but the technology has improved immensely: (check) instruments are cheaper and more expendable, so they can be deployed where they will do the most good -- right in the path of the volcano's fury. the 1980s was a very interesting decade because of the number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring information, said steven brantley, a geologist with the survey's cascades volcano observatory in vancouver, wash. scientists say the eruption of mount st. helens, which killed 57 people and caused $1 billion in property damage, triggered a renaissance in volcano research. one, in washington, keeps track of active volcanoes in the cascades range of the pacific northwest and northern california, including mount st. helens, mount rainier, mount hood, mount baker, mount shasta and mount lassen. volcanoes are probably the most complex structures you can find on this planet, said bernard chouet, a seismologist at the usgs in menlo park. 1. surveying: researchers measure the volcano, with optical instruments or high-tech laser tools, to see if it is bulging or stretching as a result of magma rising inside.
