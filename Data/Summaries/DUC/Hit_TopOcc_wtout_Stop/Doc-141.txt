third world countries led by brazil, the world's most indebted developing nation, blamed the industrialized nations in part monday for perpetuating their poverty. a similar theme sounded monday in west berlin, where finance ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded "more forceful action" to help third world countries repay $1.2 trillion in debts. brazil, with $121 billion in foreign loans, has been among the strongest third world lobbyists for debt restructuring and writeoffs. officials of the seven key industrialized nations in the non-communist realm _ the united states, west germany, japan, canada, france, italy and britain _ have approved a plan to aid the world's poorest nations, mostly in sub-saharan africa. prime minister gro harlem brundtland of norway said her country spends about 1.1 percent of its gross national product on loans and grants to developing countries, well above the average 0.34 percent by other developed countries. she urged other industrialized nations to increase financial aid, saying development and debt are related third world crises. "the industrialized countries of the north must now demonstrate that they see the poverty of the third world as their common challenge," she said.
