many coastal communities, with swelling populations, are ill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said robert sheets, director of the national hurricane center. the aftermath from hurricane gilbert in 1988 and hugo last year taught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate and protect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from maine to texas, sheets said. "if the long-term trends are any indication of what's to come, we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes," said sheets. sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity are based on studies of past decades, atmospheric low-pressure waves and increased rainfall trends in west africa, near the breeding waters for most hurricanes. between 1940 and 1969, the united states was hit by 22 hurricanes with minimum winds of 110 mph. there are five categories of hurricanes, ranging from category 1, which has top sustained winds of 74 mph to 95 mph, to category 5, with top winds greater then 155 mph. both gilbert and hugo reached category 5, according to meteorologist barry fatchwell of the national hurricane center.
