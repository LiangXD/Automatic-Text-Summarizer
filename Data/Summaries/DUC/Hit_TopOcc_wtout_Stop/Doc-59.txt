rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of gdp across the oecd between 1989 and 1992. in the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years. reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the oecd, as countries struggle to rein in government spending. the largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions. rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families. real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would be needed to pay for pensions alone - and that on the assumption that the pensions do not increase in real terms. without either tax rises or cuts in welfare budgets, current welfare spending plans could increase debt ratios on average by 90 percentage points over the next 40 years, according to one oecd study.
