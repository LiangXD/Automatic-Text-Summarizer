the pungent odor of petroleum wafts through the air as the hole turns black with crude oil, an oozing remnant of the 10.8 million gallons spilled into prince william sound last march 24 by the tanker exxon valdez. a year after the wreck of the exxon valdez, the question clings like the oil under this perry island beach. but when exxon suspended its $2 billion cleanup in mid-september, it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the oil spilled, state officials estimate. those numbers alone make the valdez spill the most lethal ever, but scientists say the actual death count is much higher, estimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank from sight or drifted out to sea. the state sued, claiming the company was negligent in responding to the spill, only to be countersued by exxon, which claimed state officials hindered the use of chemical dispersants that could have broken up large quantities of oil early on. exxon distributes before-and-after pictures of cleaned beaches bridgman and other state officials, accusing exxon of "myth-making," eagerly make room for journalists on flights to oiled beaches. exxon officials, meanwhile, say their winter monitoring of 64 sites shows wind and waves have scoured away, on average, more than half the surface oil left in september, and up to 80 percent of the buried oil.
