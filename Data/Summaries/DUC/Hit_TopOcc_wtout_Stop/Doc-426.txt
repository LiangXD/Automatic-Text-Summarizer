this is the mirage, a $630 million island-fantasy hotel-casino now being completed for opening in november by golden nugget inc. if mgm grand inc. proceeds with its plan for an amusement park -- a $700 million movieland resort with a working studio, casino and 5,000-room hotel that would become las vegas's biggest -- the investment in the three properties will total some $1.6 billion. the projects already under construction will increase las vegas's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 75,500. las vegas promises, or threatens, to become a giant carnival, with rooms to be had for $45 a day or less, for visitors uninspired solely by gambling. competitors and analysts say that among large existing properties bally manufacturing corp.'s bally grand hotel-casino probably will be hardest hit among major properties. bally bought the former mgm grand hotel-casino from kirk kerkorian four years ago. off the strip, marcor is building the rio, a hotel-casino with a brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites.
