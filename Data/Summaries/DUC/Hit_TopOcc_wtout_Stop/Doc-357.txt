although mr. bush took pains to note that no one country can claim this victory as its own, the triumph will clearly leave the u.s., along with its friends in egypt and saudi arabia, as the dominant powers in the middle east. that battle raged just inside iraq to the north of kuwait, where a broad sweeping maneuver by u.s., french and british forces trapped the premier iraqi force. in a statement read on baghdad radio, iraq finally agreed to president bush's demand not only to withdraw from kuwait, but also to accept u.n. security council resolutions that require baghdad to drop its claim to kuwait and that make iraq liable for paying war reparations. the u.s. wants to keep those sanctions in place as long as saddam hussein remains in power -- one more incentive, perhaps, for the iraqi people to topple him. so mr. assad is gambling that he will be able to use the iraqi defeat to enhance his own strength in the region and secure his control over lebanon while the u.s. and other western countries keep silent in appreciation for his help in the gulf. mr. bush and other officials were miffed that so little appreciation was expressed for u.s. efforts to eliminate the iraqi military threat. shaul bakhash, a george mason university scholar, says iran worries that the u.s. and saudi arabia will dominate postwar regional politics.
