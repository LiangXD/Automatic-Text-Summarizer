maff scientists concluded that bse had appeared in cattle given processed feed that included remains of diseased sheep. the ministry of agriculture said yesterday that by the beginning of last week the total number of cattle diagnosed since november 1986 as having bse had risen to 121,898 -- six times the original prediction. the ministry believes that the reason more cattle have died is that farmers or food renderers kept using infected feed after the ban. last week, maff said that the numbers of confirmed bse cases in the first two months of this year showed a 20 per cent drop over the same period in 1993 -- proof, the ministry says, that the epidemic is waning. some 8,004 cattle have died from bse despite being born after the feed ban was introduced. if the disease has jumped from sheep to cattle -- and cases have also been reported in kudu antelope at london zoo -- could it affect humans? that prospect, discounted by most scientists -- including maff critics such as mr purdey -- is considered a possibility by richard lacey, a leeds university microbiologist who has been studying cases of cjd, a disease with a long incubation period.
