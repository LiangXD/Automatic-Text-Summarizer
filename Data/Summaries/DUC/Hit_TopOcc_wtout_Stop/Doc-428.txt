lincoln savings &amp loan owner charles h. keating jr. was a con man who relied on lies and political influence -- juice -- to fool and bully regulators in charge of his ill-fated irvine-based thrift, california savings and loan commissioner william j. crawford told an assembly committee wednesday. george deukmejian's top campaign fund-raiser, los angeles attorney karl m. samuelian, defend his actions as one of keating's attorneys, hired to represent the arizona businessman's interests before state regulators. samuelian, deukmejian's campaign finance chairman since 1982, also said that he represented keating at several meetings with state regulators. when keating first took over lincoln in february, 1984, he told state regulators one thing but all along planned to do another, crawford said. crawford said that when he took over the department in 1985, he found that his predecessor had allowed keating to keep the original records of lincoln savings in phoenix, leaving only incomplete copies of documents for california regulators in the lincoln offices in irvine. crawford said he ordered lincoln's files to be brought back to california after he discovered keating had contributed $50,000 to arizona's attorney general in an uncontested race -- a move that persuaded him that any action by california regulators would be resisted by their counterparts in arizona. after the hearing, samuelian said he helped set up keating's meetings in february and march, 1988, with transportation and housing secretary geoghegan, a deukmejian appointee whose agency oversees the state's savings and loan and corporations regulators.
