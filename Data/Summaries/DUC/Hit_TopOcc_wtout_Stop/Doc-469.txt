an experimental cancer drug that works after a single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study. the drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-cda _ has produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia patients treated, and none has relapsed so far. researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it "may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia." it, like hairy cell leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells, which produce disease-fighting antibodies. in the published work, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients as far back as four years ago. two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed in recent years. also unlike other treatments, this one appears to work after a single seven-day course of therapy.
