commenting on judge bork's nomination to the supreme court, geoffrey stone, dean of the university of chicago law school, called it a four-star appointment and commented that it was rare to get anyone with anywhere near his credentials. judge bork's elevation to the supreme court may very well tip the balance toward this neutrality of interpretation, and there are those who fear that the court -- no longer able to do what the individual justices may think is good or moral or right -- will reject activist social, economic and criminal-justice agendas. later, in explaining the constitution he helped to forge, alexander hamilton called the judiciary the least dangerous branch, despite the life tenure for federal judges, because it had neither force nor will but merely judgment and because it could take no active resolution whatever in policy matters when that would require a choice among competing legitimate social values. they began, in the words of the late supreme court justice felix frankfurter -- a social liberal but a judicial conservative -- infusing into the vagueness of constitutional or statutory provisions their mere private notions of social policy and traded their black robes of judgment for the mantle of what sociologist david reisman has called omnicompetent arrogance. law making -- policy making -- by judges has become so pervasive that, of late, many see it as the judicial function against which potential judges must be measured. this bottom-line mentality is why judge bork's nomination is at risk even though judge bork recognizes that constitutional interpretation must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing times. judge bork's elevation to the supreme court would help restore a proper constitutional balance.
