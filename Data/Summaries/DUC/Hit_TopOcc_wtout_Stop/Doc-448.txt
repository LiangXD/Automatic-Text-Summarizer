residents of nearby angeles panicked at the roar of the initial blast, and thousands of people packed roads after a huge gray-greenish mushroom cloud burst from the volcano and turned day to night. a photographer who circled the volcano in an airplane said an aerial gunnery range at clark was covered with ash, as were mountains in the zambales range, normally lush, green tropical peaks that now looked like the alps in winter. punongbayan said tuesday that the site was in the path of the volcanic flow from mount pinatubo during its last major eruption, in 1380. the americans who fled clark with a few belongings on monday moved in with sailors and their families at subic bay naval base, 50 miles to the southwest. although the air force left clark, philippine authorities have not ordered a general evacuation of angeles, a city of more than 300,000 people adjacent to the base. in the sapang bato area of angeles, the city district nearest the volcano, just 2,000 of 13,000 residents had been evacuated as of monday, officials said. that same day, 4,452-foot mount unzen in japan erupted with an explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.
