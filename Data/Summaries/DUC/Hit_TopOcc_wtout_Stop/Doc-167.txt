exxon crews tuesday finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker exxon valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of the nation's worst-ever oil spill. meanwhile, exxon said placing an oil-catching boom around the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line. a boom wasn't placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it wasn't available in valdez, exxon officials have said. early tuesday, exxon said it had finished transferring about 42 million gallons of crude to three other ships. another 42 million gallons of oily waste water remained aboard the valdez, which spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude into prince william sound when it struck a reef march 24. canadian authorities also asked exxon for assurances there will be no damage to the british columbia coast if the tanker is towed to oregon, and the mayor of valdez said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude. an effort at sawmill bay, 11 miles west of valdez, to keep oil away from a hatchery where 2 million salmon are waiting to be released to the sea appeared to be failing.
