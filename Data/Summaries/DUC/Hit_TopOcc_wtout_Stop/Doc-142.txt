third world debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service their debts to the united states and other creditors last year than they received in new loans -- a major drain on their already cash-strapped economies -- the world bank reported sunday. the bank said that it plans to increase its own commitments for new loans to third world countries to about $16.4 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $14.8 billion in fiscal 1988. the figures on the cash drain showed that these net resource transfers, as the bank parlance terms them, are mushrooming rapidly -- a measure of the mounting strain that the global debt burden is placing on third world economies. a bank spokesman said that part of the reason that the figure is so bloated is that some countries, such as cash-rich south korea, are paying off their debts early. the total debt burden of third world countries currently is estimated at about $993 billion. the bank said the continuing deterioration in the debt situation underscores the need for further efforts by the industrial countries to help third world governments pare back their debt -- a major aim of the u.s. plan offered by treasury secretary nicholas f. brady. drain began in 1984 however, efforts under the brady plan are going relatively slowly, and world bank officials cautioned that the results may not show up for at least two or three more years.
