francis, the canadian national sprint coach, knew the polysyllabic names and complex characteristics of steroids -- furazabol, stanozolol, dianabol -- as if they were members of his family. he argues, essentially, that to be a world-class sprinter, you must use steroids -- he makes this argument even as johnson attempts a comeback for the 1992 olympic games in barcelona, spain, without them. steroids do not make a runner run faster, francis explains, but they enable a runner to train harder. by encouraging his athletes to use steroids -- and francis maintains that they all wanted to do so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up -- francis argues that he is simply helping to create a level playing field. after a two-year ban, johnson is running again without francis' coaching. francis would have us believe that without steroids, johnson cannot be the fastest. at the end of speed trap, francis says that steroids cannot be simply banned -- their use is too prevalent, they can be disguised too easily and they work too well.
