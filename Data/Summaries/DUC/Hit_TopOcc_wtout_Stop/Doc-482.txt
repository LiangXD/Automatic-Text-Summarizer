a minimum wage is a convenient and effortless way for a left-of-centre government to appear to be doing something about the problems of poverty, public sector pay and the growth of unskilled employment. the federal government has increased the statutory minimum wage twice in the past two years, most recently in april 1991. most us studies of the effects of the minimum wage over the past few decades have found a moderately negative impact on employment, mainly among young people. a recent study of the effect of extending the mainland minimum wage to puerto rico in 1974 found a more dramatic employment effect. its unemployment rate rose from 11.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent between 1974 and 1983, of which over one third is estimated to be a direct result of the rise in the minimum wage. yet a number of recent empirical studies of the effect of last year's rise in the us minimum wage fail to support this traditional view. over half of the restaurants had to raise the lowest wage they paid by the full 45 cent increase in the minimum wage.
