the persian gulf showdown between iraq and the united states took a more personal turn thursday when iraq's saddam hussein called president bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war could bring thousands of americans home in coffins. bush, commenting on the two-week-old gulf crisis from his vacation home in maine, said he saw little reason to be optimistic about a settlement of the dispute, which stems from iraq's invasion of oil-wealthy kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the border of saudi arabia. bush also said thursday that king hussein assured him jordan would close the last remaining free port to most iraqi trade as the economic embargo on materials to iraq continued unabated. in a long verbal attack read on iraqi television thursday, saddam repeatedly called bush "a liar" and said a shooting war could produce body bags courtesy of baghdad. in kuwait, the iraqis have rimmed the capital city with an air-defense system, according to a u.s. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. john prescott, a shipping correspondent, said there was no shipping in kuwaiti or iraqi ports and that activity was trailing off in the jordanian port of aqaba. bush's chief objective in his meeting with hussein was to press the king to shut down iraq's food and oil supply route from aqaba on the red sea.
