safety standards may not be stringent enough in the cruise industry, the chairman of a federal agency investigating the march engine-room fire aboard the scandinavian star said wednesday. "there may not be sufficient safety standards," he said, adding that his agency has probed fires aboard four cruise ships in the past five years. the march 15 engine-room fire aboard the star, carrying 439 mostly american passengers, was discovered by a crew member as the ship returned from cozumel, mexico to its tampa home port. because the ntsb lacks regulatory authority and because cruise ships are often registered outside the united states, he said his agency can only make recommendations. its engine room was badly damaged by the fire, and there was smoke and water damage throughout the 17-year-old french-made ship, which has since been repaired. atissue is that the board does not permit cross-examinations and contentions that the bahamian-registered ship is outside the agency's jurisdiction. the official analysis of the fire and any recommendations that come out of the hearings will be adopted by the full ntsb board in washington later this summer.
