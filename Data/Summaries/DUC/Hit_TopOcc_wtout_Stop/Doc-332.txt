moreover, mr. sununu's ouster is unlikely to result in any major changes in mr. bush's economic policies, which have attracted much criticism recently. moreover, top republicans on capitol hill, as well as some administration officials, say mr. skinner has a penchant for abrasiveness, although he is hardly mr. sununu's equal on that score. but while mr. sununu's resignation may have been personally painful for mr. bush, the president apparently decided it had become necessary to respond to mounting criticism from both democrats and republicans for his administration's handling of the country's economic problems, and to increasing disquiet from his political advisers who were concerned about his slippage in public opinion polls. nevertheless, administration officials say it's unlikely mr. sununu's departure will mean major changes in economic strategy. one administration official noted that mr. sununu was among those who argued most strongly against reopening the fight over a capital gains tax cut this year he argued it would subject mr. bush to unnecessary and unproductive political heat. another administration official, however, said mr. sununu's departure may force mr. bush to get more involved in economic issues. mr. sununu began to face rough political waters a year ago when, as one of mr. bush's chief negotiators on the deficit reduction agreement, he bruised congressional egos from both political parties with heavy-handed lobbying and what many saw as disregard for their stature as elected representatives.
