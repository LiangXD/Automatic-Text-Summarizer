rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced the beginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from april through june across texas and other tornado alley states in the nation's heartland. from 1951 through 1986, there have been an average of 118 tornadoes in texas per year, according to the state climatologist's office in college station. in april and june an average of 18 to 19 tornadoes occur each month, but in may, when weather conditions are the most unstable, that average increases to about 36. in mid-november, 11 people died in east texas when a series of tornadoes trashed towns from cherokee county to the gulf coast. a watch means weather conditions are suitable for development of a tornado, and people should keep a careful lookout for potential funnel clouds. james r. mcdonald, director of the institute for disaster research at texas tech university, says many people mistakenly try to outrun tornadoes in their cars. mcintyre said there are enough natural openings in a house to equalize air pressure, and "if that tornado wants to open your windows, it'll do that for you."
