a source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the panel report did not focus on gates -- who said he would resign if the commission agreed with his critics that he created a climate within the department that condoned racism and brutality. sources familiar with testimony and evidence presented to the panel told the los angeles times that a number of racially derogatory messages sent on police car computer terminals have been cataloged. in the days after the march 3 nightstick beating of rodney g. king, the police department released transcripts of computer messages that one of the officers at the scene sent to a another officer. at the same time, secret testimony by as many as a dozen black police officers told of numerous instances of racial harassment within the ranks and the existence of a double standard in the treatment of minority suspects. the american civil liberties union and other groups called for gates to resign after the march 3 incident in which white police officers repeatedly struck king with batons, kicked him and shocked him with a stun gun after pulling him over for speeding. gates was appointed by the police commission and cannot be fired by the mayor. geoffrey taylor gibbs, who sits on the board of john m. langston bar association, which represents about 900 african american lawyers, said black and latino neighborhoods are depending on the commission to confirm their view that the white, male-dominated police department has subjected them to years of brutality and ignored their complaints.
