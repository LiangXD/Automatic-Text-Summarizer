some of this year's drought in the midwest may have been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equator in the pacific ocean, according to a new computer study reported thursday. such droughts could be anticipated if the temperature abnormalities turn out to be predictable, one of the authors said in the report appearing in friday's issue of science magazine. in this period, pacific ocean temperatures ranged up to 5.4 degrees fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about 4,000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of south america, with the coolest spot midway along the band. at the same time, a bit to the north of this band, surface temperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal. when this temperature pattern was fed into the computer, the pattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems was reproduced. the below-normal equatorial temperature by itself did not give such a result. the global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of a more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these abnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought, he said.
