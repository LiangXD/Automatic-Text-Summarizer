if the committee so advises, japan's prime minister will issue an earthquake warning for the tokai area. long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, japan continues to spend dollars 2.5m (pounds 1.6m) a year monitoring the tokai region and close to dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research. for prediction believers, it is a small price to pay, as japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. despite the protests, however, japan's earthquake prediction programme rolls along on inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations. japan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists throughout the world were optimistic about prediction. japan has had numerous killer quakes outside the tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off the coast of hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives. kiyoo mogi, chairman of the six-member panel that will make the call on the tokai earthquake and former head of the university of tokyo's earthquake research institute, says several factors make the tokai region more suited than others for what he calls 'a national experiment'.
