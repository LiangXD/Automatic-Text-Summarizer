backers of house legislation to raise the minimum wage lowered their target to $4.55 an hour on the eve of debate as president bush declared he had the votes to sustain a veto should congress go above $4.25. the democratic sponsors of the bill, scheduled for floor debate beginning today, also agreed tuesday to include a sub-minimum training wage in their measure, a 60-day proposal that falls far short of the six-month period demanded by bush. bush appeared with labor secretary elizabeth dole, who was there to deliver a letter from 35 republican senators who promised to side with bush should he veto minimum-wage legislation that fails to meet white house guidelines. the administration guidelines include raising the minimum wage, now at $3.35 an hour, to $4.25 an hour by 1992, provided employers can pay new hires a "training wage" of $3.35 an hour for six months. the bill due for house debate today calls for raising the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1992 and has no provision for a sub-minimum training wage, an idea long opposed by the sponsors and organized labor, which has been lobbying heavily against such proposals. but the sponsors, facing mounting pressure from the white house and moderate democrats, agreed to scale back the final level to $4.55 and add a training wage in an amendment worked out tuesday that has the support of the house leadership. the training wage would initially be $3.35 an hour but would increase to 85 percent of the subsequent increases in the minimum wage.
