but the senate already has voted to force the census bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment. it boils down to regional politics, says arturo vargas, census-program director for the mexican american legal defense and educational fund, one of several hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants. counting illegal immigrants in 1990 is likely to mean one less seat in the house for pennsylvania and one more for california, according to the private population reference bureau. the census bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the immigration and naturalization service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in california. although the 106 million census forms can be reprinted if congress acts soon, wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge, mr. bonpanne says. because california, texas and other populous states that benefit from counting the illegal immigrants have such large delegations in the house, the house has always presented a bigger obstacle to the opponents of counting such immigrants. the house did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from knowingly counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds.
