but the national science foundation, which runs u.s. bases, thinks that the government's commitment to antarctica will wane, what with new restrictions on mineral development and declining soviet competition. this year, after a budget battle, more money was appropriated for u.s. antarctica research, partly by redirecting funds earmarked for housing for the poor. nations realized they needed a base to qualify for membership in the treaty system that governs antarctica, which was up for renegotiation this year. during those negotiations, australia, new zealand and france, responding to environmental concerns, blocked an agreement that would have permitted nations to survey antarctica for minerals and oil -- even though the pact would have set difficult hurdles before development could begin. instead, in october, the antarctic treaty nations approved a substitute that bars mineral and oil exploration for at least 50 years and requires environmental safeguards for research bases. critics say the environmental provisions will make science more expensive in antarctica, already the costliest research site apart from outer space. they bring families to live in antarctica, not just scientists, encourage women to give birth at their bases and postmark letters there -- all to back claims of sovereignty.
