the senate today confirmed conservative civil rights official clarence thomas as a federal appeals judge, brushing aside complaints about his record from some liberal and senior citizens groups. the senate had planned to take a roll call on the nomination but changed course at the last minute and confirmed thomas on a voice vote. "i am prepared to concede that mr. thomas is going to be confirmed," said sen. david pryor, d-ark., chairman of the senate special committee on aging, who complained that the statute of limitations on 15,000 age-discrimination cases before the eeoc ran out without any action being taken while thomas was in charge. danforth, thomas' chief senate supporter and former employer, said he could vouch for the nominee's abilities as a lawyer. alan simpson, r-wyo., dismissed complaints that thomas had failed to cooperate with the aging committee several years ago when former sen. before becoming chairman of the commission, he worked under danforth in the missouri attorney general's office and in the senate as well for the monsanto corp.
