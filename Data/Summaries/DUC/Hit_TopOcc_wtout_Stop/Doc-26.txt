as they scanned the flow of passengers at los angeles international airport, police detective clayton searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby. when searle noticed a short, muscular black man walk toward them and then turn abruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes los angeles police detective moved in quickly to question him. only later did searle and his partner from the drug enforcement administration realize that the suspected drug courier they had arrested on that march day in 1988 was joe morgan, the former cincinnati reds second baseman who was inducted monday into major league baseball's hall of fame. the 46-year-old morgan, who is now an oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster, is suing searle and the city of los angeles in federal court, claiming that he was unfairly targeted because he is black and fit a certain profile that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like. the morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports. honey a. lewis, who represents the officer and the police department, said searle had acted properly and was merely asking morgan to identify himself when morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities and slapping the officer. according to searle's sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and woessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier.
