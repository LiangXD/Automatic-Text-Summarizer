powell, 52, was nominated on thursday by president bush to become the nation's top military officer. powell, who served as national security adviser in the final year of president ronald reagan's administration, will succeed adm. powell fits the mold of bush's national security advisers, like-minded pragmatists who favor consensus-building rather than confrontation. powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have outweighed his military experience. he's had experiences few can match," said robert sims, a former pentagon spokesman who knew powell when he served as defense secretary caspar weinberger's military aide. along with his predecessor as national security adviser, frank carlucci, powell was credited with helping the reagan white house recover from the iran-contra affair. powell served in southeast asia as an adviser to south vietnamese units in 1962 and 1963 and as executive officer of an infantry battalion and as a division operations officer in 1968 and 1969.
