bill rodgers, a four-time boston marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at mr. kelley: it's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing. even the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385 yards leaves some of mr. kelley's rivals of yesteryear gasping. a two-time winner in boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, mr. kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year -- as he has been for 15 years. two state troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound mr. kelley into boston so he won't be trampled by groupies, as he calls them, clamoring to shake his hand. of course, mr. kelley -- not to be confused with the other john kelley, who won the boston marathon in 1957 -- isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32 minutes, 7 seconds. a mechanic for boston edison co. before he retired in 1972, mr. kelley started running in the evenings after work more than six decades ago. he isn't particular about brands of shoes ( i wear them all ) or what he eats ( i never eat broccoli, but i love steak and ice cream. ) mr. kelley aims to run till he is at least 100 years old.
