lilongwe june 6 sapa -- three million people will need emergency food aid in 1994/95 following widespread crop failure in central and southern malawi, the united nations food aid organisation [fao] said on monday [6 june]. a recent fao/world food programme crop assessment mission blamed the crop failure on erratic and insufficient rainfall. this year's cereal production among smallholders is estimated to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest, and only 28 per cent higher than in 1991/92, when drought devasted southern africa. of the cereal food aid requirement, about 175,000 tons would be needed as emergency assistance for some three million people. despite a bumper harvest last year, malawi has not recovered from the massive 1991/92 drought. thus food shortages and high prices can quickly aggravate an already critical situation. although landlocked, malawi proved in the 1991/92 drought it was adequately equipped to handle the transportation, storage and internal distribution of large volumes of food imported through south africa, mozambican or, possibly, tanzanian ports [words indistinct].
