(it is interesting to note, however, that hamilton was not discussing term limits on the legislature, and was actually arguing against the term limits on the chief executive that are contained now in the 22nd amendment.) the only respectable argument in favor of term limits that i know of refers to the legislature and involves the interaction with the seniority system. the various complexities about legislative term limits and their interaction with seniority do not arise for executive term limits. the only defense for executive term limits is that the electorate needs to be protected against itself, an argument which, if true, would mean that democracy was seriously flawed and would work much less well than it seems to. to some extent, the current pressures for legislative term limits reflect the reverse desire to shift power away from congress. perhaps the best test of executive term limits is to check whether the states with term limits on the governor have performed better or worse than those without such limits. the answer, if one holds constant geographical region and the level of per capita income in 1960, is that states with term limits experienced slightly below average growth of per-capita income over the last 30 years but were also a little below average in the fraction of state product that went to state and local government expenditures.
