as hurricane gilbert's record-breaking fury sends caribbean islanders scrambling for cover, national hurricane center director bob sheets remained calm at his helm. edt tuesday night, making gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere in terms of barometric pressure, but sheets handled a mob of reporters with ease. with his schedule of interviews timed to the minute, sheets spent most of tuesday on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large monitor showing the destructive gilbert in full color sprawled across much of the western caribbean. interest in gilbert has been high since it started packing hurricane-force winds last weekend and by tuesday night became a category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph. gilbert has been compared to the labor day hurricane of 1935, which slammed into the florida keys and killed 408 people, and hurricane camille, which devastated the mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256 _ the only other category 5 storms to hit land this century. and while sheets might appear to spend most of his day with tiny microphones snaking down his back and fielding media questions, he also writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts. dealing with a major hurricane isn't much different from dealing with smaller ones or tropical storms, sheets said, adding that gilbert has been particularly "well-behaved."
