ljubljana, yugoslavia -- as federal army tanks and jets pounded the breakaway republic of slovenia last week, the pin-striped brokers of the ljubljana stock exchange defied air-raid dangers and gathered in their sixth-floor trading room. the price of vouchers to obtain foreign exchange jumped 10%, even though slovene banks had stopped issuing foreign currency. </lp> yesterday, with a tenuous peace settling over slovenia, the exchange panicked. their identity is being turned upside down once known as yugoslavia's developed north, slovenia will now be lumped together with western europe's underdeveloped south. joze mencinger, an economist and former finance minister of slovenia, illustrates the republic's economic resilience by noting that while yugoslavia's industrial output fell 18% so far this year, slovenia's declined only 10%. it's not size that makes a country successful, says josip skoberne, head of the international division of the slovene chamber of economy, citing ec-member luxembourg, far smaller in population and area than slovenia. finding new markets in the west is all the more urgent with the certain decline in slovenia's trade with the rest of yugoslavia. at the stock exchange, mr. veselinovic frets that his post-independence plans to trade in gold, commodities and foreign currencies are jeopardized by the uncertainty engulfing slovenia.
