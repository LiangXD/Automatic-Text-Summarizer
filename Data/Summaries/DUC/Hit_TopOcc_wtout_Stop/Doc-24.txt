two days of racially charged hearings on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds. the racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a city council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks. daley is filling the remaining two years of the term of the late harold washington, the city's first black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he died in november 1987. "i will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of chicago," daley said. also last week, a human relations task force made up of business and civic leaders released a report saying racism in chicago was fueled by "a shocking lack of contact" between the city's ethnic groups. the report, based on a 15-month investigation of the city's race relations, concluded that racial divisions "threaten to make chicago an increasingly unpleasant place to live and are antithetical to the city's economic growth and prosperity." at the city council hearings thursday and friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.
