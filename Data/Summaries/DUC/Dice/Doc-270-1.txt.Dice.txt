While the newspaper has accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the Shining Path, the paper has also stressed that the peace called for in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical retreat by the Shining Path leaders and is not, as President Alberto Fujimori has contended, an implicit admission of defeat. Tactical Retreat for Guzman Implicitly rejecting Fujimori's claim that the Shining Path's call for a negotiated peace represented an admission of political defeat by the insurgents, La Republica concluded that the movement's leadership saw its call for peace as nothing more than a temporary ceasefire (25 January).(See Note 3) According to the daily's 26 January editorial, the Shining Path tract makes it clear that in the eyes of Abimael Guzman a peace agreement is simply an armed truce until after the year 2OOO, at which time the Shining Path would resume its bloodbath. (Note 3) For example, in his presentation of the video recording of Guzman's first call for peace talks, Fujimori claimed that the Shining Path political leadership has tacitly admitted that the Peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in confronting the Shining Path (Lima Radio and TV, 4 October 1993). Outlook La Republica's assessment of the Shining Path peace strategy document may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling for peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders. At the same time, however, by concluding that the published strategy statement is merely the Shining Path's declaration of temporary retreat, the daily has raised new questions about the credibility of Fujimori's claim that the call for peace represents a victory for the government. BOX Media Doubts over Earlier Shining Path Peace Letters -- Following the first Guzman letter calling for peace talks, announced by Fujimori at thee United Nations last October (Radio Programas del Peru, 1 October 1993), the conservative daily El Comercio reported that one seasoned political observer had warned that Guzman's reported desire to reach a peace agreement does not mean there is reason to claim a victory in the ongoing struggle against terrorism since, according to the observer, the imprisoned insurgent leader may no longer control the Shining Path (2 October 1993). -- Following the second Guzman letter, which supplemented the call for peace talks with what seemed to be praise for Fujimori's economic and political program (Lima Global de Television, 1O October 1993), a commentator for the anti-Fujimori weekly Caretas wrote that the government was using a broken Guzman in the campaign for the 'yes' vote for the upcoming referendum, adding that it is no coincidence that the letters... have come out during the 3O days prior to the 31 October vote (14 October 1993). -- Responding similarly to the second Guzman letter, an editorial in La Republica wondered whether government representatives, working to promote the yes vote on the referendum, had not fallen into a trap by thinking that Shining Path militants would take seriously such an unctuous call for peace talks as appeared in the letter (14 October 1993). -- Also in response to the second letter, Caretas on 14 October claimed that Fujimori was using Guzman in the campaign to win the 31 October referendum, noting that with Guzman's letters calling for peace talks, Fujimori's promise to wipe out the Shining Path by 1995 may gain credibility.
