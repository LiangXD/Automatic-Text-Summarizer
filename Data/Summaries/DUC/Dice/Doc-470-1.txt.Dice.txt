There aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay away for as long as four years, says Lawrence Piro, chief of cancer research at Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation, La Jolla, Calif., where the drug was developed. The leukemia hasn't come back in any of the patients we treated. It is without doubt the most effective treatment for hairy-cell leukemia, in terms of rapidity of response, adds Elihu H. Estey, a cancer researcher at the University of Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. As the disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to infection and often need blood transfusions. Until the mid-1980s, treatments were ineffective, and patients often died of blood problems and infections. Since then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from hairy-cell leukemia. The researchers said the drug is easy to produce and thus is likely to be less expensive than other cancer treatments. Within eight to 10 weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their blood or bone marrow; the 12th had a small amount remaining in the marrow, but he declined further bone marrow monitoring, Dr. Piro said. None of the patients have had a relapse; complete remission has lasted from seven to 46 months after treatment, according to the study. But because hairy-cell leukemia proliferates slowly, a relapse could occur long after treatment. It's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments. About 50% to 60% of patients -- most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the drug, some with complete remission, he said.
