Nine reservists helping in the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf were among the 13 people killed in the crash of U.S. military cargo plane in West Germany, military authorities said Wednesday. Four of the 17 people aboard the cargo plane were injured when the massive aircraft tumbled into a field early Wednesday after taking off from Ramstein Air Base, a stopover for many U.S. military flights bound for the gulf region. Nine of those killed and one of those injured were reservists with the 433rd Military Airlift Wing from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. The four others were stationed at Ramstein or at nearby Hahn Air Base. Richard W. Chase, pilot; Sgt. Daniel G. Perez, loadmaster; Sgt. Richard M. Price, first pilot; Sgt. Lonty A. Knutson, crew chief; and Sgt. Cynthia Borecky of England Air Base, Louisiana, and Sgt. The four were hospitalized and reported in satisfactory condition, said Sgt. The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron from Travis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-Mein Air Base near Frankfurt, authorities said. It left the Ramstein air base at about 12:30 a.m. and clipped the tops of trees before crashing and breaking apart. Ramstein, the largest U.S. Air Force base in Europe, is 90 miles west of Frankfurt. The C-5 is the largest transport plane in the Air Force fleet and costs about $148 million. The crash Wednesday occurred a day after the second anniversary of a collision during an air show at Ramstein which killed 70 people.
