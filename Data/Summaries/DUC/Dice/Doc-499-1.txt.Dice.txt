Many past national security advisers have fancied themselves grand world strategists, yet have failed at the basic task of making the national-security apparatus run smoothly. As a result, Gen. Powell, named the new national security adviser last week, appears to be the right man for the job at this stage of the Reagan administration. Gen. Powell, who has been serving as deputy national security adviser, fits the bill. He always impressed me as being a good inside politician -- a good infighter, yet also a peacemaker, says Michael Burch, who was an assistant defense secretary when Gen. Powell was Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's top miltary assistant. Gen. Powell convinced Mr. Weinberger to warn the Pentagon public affairs office a day in advance. Gen. Powell also has shown that he can present issues to his boss without seeming to impose his own views -- a skill useful in maintaining the image of honest broker of ideas important for a national security adviser. Colleagues recall that when Gen. Powell thought an issue should be brought to Mr. Weinberger's attention, he often privately urged other officials to raise it at the defense chief's regular staff meetings. Recently, Gen. Powell has told visitors that the National Security Council staff should function as a collegial infantry batallion. It isn't a term a grandiloquent national security adviser like Henry Kissinger would have used, but it's an indicator of the kind of efficient and noncontroversial NSC operation Gen. Powell can be expected to run.
