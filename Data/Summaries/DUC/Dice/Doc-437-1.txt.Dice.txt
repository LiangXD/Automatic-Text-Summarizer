On the Turkey-Iraq border, thousands of Kurdish families still bury their dead and struggle to survive.; In Bangladesh, rescue workers continue to find drowned babies lashed to uprooted trees, tied on by parents who wanted to protect their young from the cyclone that devastated the country.; Interest in a disaster is contingent on media coverage, said Alex deWaal, associate director of London-based Africa Watch. Because of internal government opposition, civil war and an undeveloped infrastructure, delivering food supplies and obtaining accurate numbers are difficult and sometimes impossible, they say.; We know there are places almost out of food, said Rist.; Just as the need is exploding, however, resources of relief programs such as CARE are decreasing, according to reports from the General Accounting Office and the Committee on Refugees.; The United States remains the world's biggest aid donor, contributing more than $250 million last year. Several African governments, including Sudan, have been accused in the past of doing just that.; Human rights violations outlined in reports by Africa Watch and Amnesty International have led some people to suggest that the United States and United Nations should attach conditions to humanitarian aid. Otherwise, they say, food often is given to soldiers, who in turn keep oppressive governments in power.; Although officials at the Agency for International Development won't confirm it, relief workers say the agency diverted a shipment of food from Mozambique until the country promised the food would be delivered to its hungry population instead of to the army.
