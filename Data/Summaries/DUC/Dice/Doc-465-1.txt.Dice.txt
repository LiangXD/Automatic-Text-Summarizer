A form of blood cancer that strikes children appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the body's ability to make interferon, according to a study published today. The researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's production of interferon, a disease-fighting substance, may play a role in warding off the development of cancer. The researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as regulators that stop the body's cells from becoming cancerous. Cancer can also occur when other genes, known as anti-oncogenes, are missing. The production of two forms of interferon, known as alpha and beta-1, are controlled by two genes that are close together on chromosome 9 in the body's library of genes.
