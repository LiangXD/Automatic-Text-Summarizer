Cheers erupted Saturday on both sides of the English Channel when British and French workers digging the Channel Tunnel finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through and shake hands. Using jackhammers, Graham Fagg, 42, of Dover, England, and Philippe Cozette, 37, of Calais, France, knocked out the last foot of chalk to link up the British and French sides of the tunnel -- which has been dubbed a chunnel. The train trip through just the tunnel is expected to take 35 minutes, compared with 90 minutes to cross the channel by ferry. The British tunnelers actually linked up with the French on Oct. 29, when workers drilled a 2-inch hole through the chalk in a service tunnel. The connection ended Britain's island separation from continental Europe for the first time since the last Ice Age about 8,000 years ago. Fagg and Cozette were chosen by draw from among the 3,000 workers to represent their countries in Saturday's meeting. Michel Delebarre and Malcolm Rifkind, the French and British transportation ministers, rode in small service trains down the maintenance tunnel to witness the handshake. Nine workers have been killed during the project. The tunnel is viewed positively in France, where it is expected to revive economically depressed northern areas.
