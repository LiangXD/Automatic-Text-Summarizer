Long plagued by soaring costs and drilling delays, the tunnel now looks set to open on time in June 1993. But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits. European Rail Link Ltd., a consortium formed last November to build the rail link, had asked the government to contribute #350 million towards the total #2.6 billion cost of the link. He said British Rail, which owns 50% of the consortium, would consider other options for a fast-rail link. Defending the decision, Mrs. Thatcher earlier told Parliament that the government already had earmarked almost #2 billion for chunnel-related projects, including #600 million on roads leading to the tunnel and #1.3 billion in passenger and freight rail services. As a result of Thursday's decision, the journey time to London from Paris will be about three hours -- 30 minutes longer than with a high-speed rail link. Eurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable without the high-speed rail link. We make more money on road traffic using our tunnel, Mr. Morton says. There is in no sense a feeling we must have that link to make the tunnel successful. But Mr. Morton admits he wants to see the high-speed link built, professing it would divert traffic from southeast England's clogged roads. Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services. If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links.
