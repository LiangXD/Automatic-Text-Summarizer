What's On in Las Vegas is a handy biweekly magazine that lists not only entertainment and other attractions around the city, but offers much helpful general information, too. In its regular feature, What's On for the Young at Heart, it reports that seniors get 25% off regular rates at the St. Tropez Hotel, an all-suite, non-gaming hotel on Harmon Avenue off the Strip. The magazine also tells about the Southern Nevada University of Cosmetology, which gives a 20% discount on all services Thursday and Friday to those 60 years and older. The column also tells of the Las Vegas Transit System's sizable senior offer, cited in this column before but worth repeating. Seniors can pick up a copy at any hotel in Las Vegas or send $2.50 to What's On in Las Vegas Magazine, 610 S. Also from Las Vegas is a $2 reference guide published by the Las Vegas Advisor. Other features are the costs of all Las Vegas production shows, plus a map and toll-free numbers for all casinos and other travel services.
