Mr. Seibold, a 20-year veteran of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., has been in the first wave of regulators in many a bank seizure. Testifying in Mr. Keating's court challenge to the takeover, Mr. Seibold said lots of documents -- loan and credit files -- were missing when an FDIC team swept through Lincoln's offices in Phoenix, Ariz., April 14, 1989. In sorting out what belonged where after the takeover, Lincoln's files were returned to Lincoln's building. Mr. Keating also said that Lincoln was required to keep all original loan files at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. Mr. Seibold wouldn't speak to reporters about Mr. Keating's version of the events.
