Exxon officials Monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of Alaskan coastline fouled by the nation's largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a suspension of local environmental laws. The plan makes no provisions for continuing the cleanup beyond mid-September, and notes that 191 miles of lightly oiled coastline may not be cleaned mechanically at all, but be allowed to be washed naturally by the environment. Since March 24, when an Exxon tanker struck a reef outside Valdez and poured more than 10 million gallons of North Slope crude into Prince William Sound, Exxon has financed cleanup crews fighting the spreading sludge. Signs of the spill have been sighted about 500 miles southwest of Valdez. Before the plan was released, Yost said he wanted much more detail than Exxon's original cleanup plan, which included nothing on polluted areas outside the sound. Meanwhile, tar and sludge from the Valdez spill fouled the beaches of Alaska's wild Katmai National Park, drenching hundreds of sea otters and birds and threatening the huge brown bears prowling the refuge. We have seen several hundred sea otters swimming in oil. The oil has had an impact on virtually the entire coastline of the park," Bane said. We have one verified sighting of a bear walking through the oil," Bane said. Exxon is feeling the effects of the spill far beyond Alaska waters. Exxon also received sharp criticism from the federal government, which accused the company of "foot-dragging" in the construction of a second facility in Seward to aid in the cleanup of sea otters fouled by the oil.
