This year's cereal production among smallholders is estimated to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest, and only 28 per cent higher than in 1991/92, when drought devasted southern Africa. Of the cereal food aid requirement, about 175,000 tons would be needed as emergency assistance for some three million people. Another 270,000 tons would be required to be sold in the market to stabilise food supply and prices. Despite a bumper harvest last year, Malawi has not recovered from the massive 1991/92 drought. Malnutrition rates have always been very high in Malawi, even with good harvests.
