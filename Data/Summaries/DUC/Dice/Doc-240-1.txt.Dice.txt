IN VIRGINIA the North American Free Trade Agreement evokes a passionate opposition, but football, apparently, still is the reigning obsession. A 'not this Nafta' rally on Saturday provided little competition for the college 'game of the century' - Florida State University against Notre Dame. The organisers said they were sending a message to Virginia's three wavering congressmen that a 'yes' vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be 'remembered in November'. 'We are absolutely for free trade,' says Mr Bill Diggitt, the state director of Mr Perot's United We Stand. Mexican workers are treated like slaves, he claims. 'In Virginia there was slavery, but the slaves were expensive and the people who owned them valued them. Virginia has 11 congressmen. Mr Greenwood's congressman, Norman Sisisky, spent Friday meeting groups from both sides. As a member of the House armed services committee he expects the foreign policy implications of the Nafta vote to weigh heavily in his decision. The Virginia business community began a pro-Nafta lobbying effort last March. Company employees were exhorted to write or call their congressman. The anti-Nafta forces on Saturday published long lists of business contributors to the pro-Nafta congressmen. A visit to Congressman Sisisky had not been encouraging, says Mr Beckwith. In Portsmouth, Virginia, one of the last undecided congressmen, Owen Pickett, is in his district office, as he is every weekend. His door bears a sign, 'This office belongs to the people of the second district of Virginia'.
