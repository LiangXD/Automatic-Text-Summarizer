But the silky steeliness displayed during the crisis by Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has revived discussion of moving Vice President Dan Quayle out to make room for the general on the 1992 Republican ticket.; Yet there is some evidence to suggest that if Powell ever decided to seek elected office, he might be at least as comfortable running as a Democrat.; No one, of course, can imagine Powell carrying the Democratic banner next year against President Bush, his commander-in-chief. And, as the general's career unfolds, Democrats should not assume his loyalties lie irrevocably with the GOP.; To begin with, no one knows Powell's political affiliation. Though he has prospered in Republican administrations, he also thrived in the Carter administration.; Publicly, Powell brushes aside all questions about his political ideology and ambitions. I can tell you, however, that proves how great his political skills are. ; As reticent as he is, though, Powell has publicly expressed views on enough foreign and domestic subjects to give some clues of his leanings. But Powell's views do not represent a new mold for the party. Rather, if he choose a political career as a Democrat, Powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's Henry Scoop Jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions on defending U.S. interests abroad.; The bottom line is that Powell presents intriguing opportunities for both parties.
