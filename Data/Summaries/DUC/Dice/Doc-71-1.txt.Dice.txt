West German police said one pilot was killed in the in-flight crash. She said the aircraft, assigned to the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn Air Base, crashed at 1:30 p.m. West German police spokesman Hugo Lenxweiler told the AP in a telephone interview that one of the pilots was killed in the accident. "The other pilot was able to eject safely," Lenxweiler said. Al Sattler said the pilot in the Black Forest crash ejected safely before the crash and was taken to Ramstein Air Base to be examined. Sattler said the aircraft was from the 52nd Tactical Fighter Wing, stationed at Spangdahlen Air Base. The aircraft was taking part in a NATO military tactical air exercise being conducted from the Canadian air force base in Baden-Soellingen, Sattler said.
