The crash comes at a particularly sensitive time for the travel industry. Although it has always been difficult to measure the effect of crashes on travel, this accident comes just as people were starting to get over fears of terrorism related to the Persian Gulf war. Airlines have been slashing their flight schedules and laying off employees because of the downturn. The jet, which can hold at least 100 passengers, carried 20 passengers and a crew of two pilots and three flight attendants. Yesterday's marks the third crash of a United jet in the past three years. Moments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23 miles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, Mr. Hall said. If preliminary reports that there was wind shear in the area are true, then that would indicate there was some instability in the atmosphere, he added. The last major U.S. wind shear accident occurred in Dallas in 1985, when a Delta Air Lines jet crashed on approach. Since then, the FAA and the industry have revamped pilot training on wind shear and have devoted considerable resources to dealing with the hazard. The jet involved in the crash is almost nine years old.
