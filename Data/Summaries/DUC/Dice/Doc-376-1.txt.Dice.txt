A major earthquake rumbled through the jungles of southern Sudan on Sunday near the war-torn region's largest city, but officials said there appeared to be no casualties and little damage. But much of the area affected by the quake is so isolated that any news might take days or weeks. Juba, southern Sudan's largest city, is 60 miles southwest of the quake's reported epicenter. Scientists said the quake's epicenter was 700 miles south of Sudan's capital, Khartoum. Relief workers in two rebel-controlled villages, Bor and Torit, apparently told officials in Nairobi, Kenya, the earthquake caused no damage there. Egypt's two principal earthquake monitoring stations, including one at the Aswan High Dam, 600 miles south of Cairo and just north of the Sudan border, recorded the quake at 7.5 on the Richter scale. "This is an extremely dangerous earthquake. It is the first time that such a quake has struck this area." The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A magnitude of 7 is considered a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage. Magnitude 8 is a great earthquake capable of tremendous damage. Last October's earthquake near San Francisco registered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
