A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens. Census figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among the states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local governments. The problem has been in deciding which states may count these people as residents. The battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both in committee and on the House floor. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 million to run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year, including $800 million to take the census. Opponents noted the Constitution requires House seats to be apportioned based on all the "persons" residing in a state. "Every census since the Constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens," observed Rep. The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget for the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal aliens, he said. Census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete illegal aliens, contending they cannot determine who is in the country legally.
