Gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the '50s and '60s, because of an apparent break in the periodic West African drought. The most intense hurricanes, Gray explains, usually form at low latitudes from tropical disturbances moving westward from Africa. Hurricanes are classified by the Saffir-Simpson scale, the fiercest a No. Officially a 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it may be a borderline 5, says meteorologist Mark Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The strongest recorded storm on Earth, Zimmer says, was 1979 Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars. Outside the Atlantic area and the eastern Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons or cyclones. The threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded, says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Hurricanes are like huge, self-sustaining heat engines spinning across the sea. If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will, Emanuel explains. The biggest uncertainty, he says, is whether global warming will affect tropical ocean temperatures.
