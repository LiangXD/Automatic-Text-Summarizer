The focus of the drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most areas, the National Weather Service reported Thursday. Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the Great Lakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency's Climate Analysis Center reported. And a separate climate assessment added that many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months. The new National Weather Service forecasts cast a dark cloud over that assumption. The drought region now extends well into West Virginia and includes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky and Tennessee, the weather service drought advisory said. The drought has been accompanied by higher than normal temperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western Great Lakes region. Reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation, however, the weather service noted.
