Prospects for enactment of the first minimum-wage increase in eight years have improved sharply in recent days, sparked by Vice President George Bush's call for a boost in the wage floor. Wage-increase bills were languishing on Capitol Hill only two weeks ago, with many members of Congress reluctant to support a wage rise in the face of heavy small-business lobbying and arguments that the increase would mean job losses. President Reagan, who had sternly characterized minimum-wage increases as causing unemployment, was quoted by the Detroit News last week as saying he and Mr. Bush were in agreement -- there could be some {minimum wage} increase because of inflation. The Senate took up the minimum-wage bill late last week, and backers and opponents alike said prospects are strong for Senate approval of the measure. The training wage, previously called a youth sub-minimum wage, has long been pushed by the Reagan administration, and Mr. Bush said he wants it too. But the AFL-CIO and many other backers of a minimum-wage boost say the training wage is merely a way for employers to get cheap, entry-level workers. If the Hatch amendment prevails, a House labor panel staff member suggests the House may spurn the bill. The Senate bill would boost the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour, which has prevailed since January 1981, to $4.55 an hour over three years. Pending House legislation would lift the wage floor to $5.05 an hour over four years. Provisions that would tie increases in the minimum wage to rises in average manufacturing wages after three years have been stricken from the bills.
