Sununu created an appearance problem by using a government car to travel to a New York stamp show, Bush said, but given the circumstances, I think it was appropriate. ; He added, however: It doesn't set a precedent. It was Sununu's first appearance on a network program since revelations in April about his extensive use of government planes for activities ranging from visiting his dentist to skiing to trips to his home state of New Hampshire.; On Sunday, Sununu gave the same explanation for using the government car that he had offered for using government planes -- that he must be able to communicate instantly with the White House in the interest of national security.; Sununu has been unable to fly on government planes for personal business since Bush instituted new travel rules after the April controversy.; Sununu since has asked sponsors of political events at which he is to speak to obtain corporate jets to take him to and from Washington. Beneficial had been prepared to fly Sununu to and from the event, but Sununu changed his mind and took the car at the last minute, officials said.; White House officials said the local press has raised the transportation issue on every Sununu trip since April, reflecting how the controversy has played nationally.
