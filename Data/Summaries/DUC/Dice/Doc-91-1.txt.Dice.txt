Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens. The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills which would require the Census Bureau to figure out whether people are in the country legally and, if not, to delete them from the counts used in reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens benefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra seats in the House. Ridge cited the 1980 census, which estimated the number of illegal aliens at 2 million. "Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens," added Rep. The Census Bureau also opposes the bills, contending that the effort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay and complicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell the truth anyway. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., contended that counting aliens "in effect, is granting representation in Congress to individuals who have entered this country by breaking the laws of the United States."
