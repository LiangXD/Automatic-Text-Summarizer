An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise ship off the Mexican coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze and the ship with 715 people aboard was towed to port. "The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the Mexican navy to Cancun," said Diaz. There were no injuries from the fire, but a 71-year-old St. Petersburg man who suffered a heart attack was in stable condition and on his way home aboard a Coast Guard plane. The ship was expected to arrive in Cancun late Wednesday or Thursday. In August 1984, a fire struck the Star's sister ship, the Scandinavian Sun, in the port of Miami, killing a passenger and a crewman. Wednesday's fire occurred as the Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off Isla Mujeres, a Mexican island north of the tourist resort Cancun in the Yucatan peninsula, the Coast Guard said.
