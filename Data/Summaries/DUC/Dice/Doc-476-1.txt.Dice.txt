At the same time, if a state's minimum is higher than the federal minimum, the state minimum applies. Moreover, the quoted minimum wage for a state is often deceptive. Moreover, 13 states have minimums below the federal level and nine have no minimum at all. Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05. A minimum wage of $5.05 would require even the high-minimum-wage states of California and Connecticut to increase their mandated minimums by 19%. Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living. California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages. Compare these unemployment rates to those of Alabama and Louisiana, states that have no minimum wage. The advantage of allowing state or regional differences in minimum-wage levels is that the appropriate minimum wage for Connecticut might force massive layoffs in Texas. Yet 41 states are still at or below the current federal level.
