A prosecutor calls it "witchcraft" and a psychologist says it's as reliable as a coin toss. After years of debate, court rulings and federal legislation, use of the polygraph has dropped sharply, despite supporters who insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a lie. The court, noting polygraph studies have shown success rates varying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent, said: "There remains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraph testing to detect deceit." "I think it's appropriate to seek if someone is lying, and the most appropriate way is to seek evidence," said Judy Crockett, who fought on behalf of the federal law for the American Civil Liberties Union. The federal law, which took effect a year ago, has taken a big bite out of the polygraph business. However, these trends do not mean polygraph testing is dead. Reading from a Defense Department statement regarding the use of polygraphs, Turner said: "In all instances the polygraph exam process produced data of important security or criminal significance which was not otherwise obtainable. Many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if both the prosecution and defense agree. New Mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a polygraph examination as evidence, with the trial judge deciding whether the tests meet certain standards. David Raskin, a University of Utah psychologist often called upon to support polygraphs in the courtroom, said he favored the federal law because lie detectors were being misused to predict future performance in the workplace. "Jurors are very cautious with polygraph evidence. They do not ignore other evidence and concentrate on the polygraph."
