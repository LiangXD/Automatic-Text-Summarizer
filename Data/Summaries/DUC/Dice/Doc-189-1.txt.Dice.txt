The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season had more storms than usual and some forecasters predict that's just a hint of more frequent and more forceful hurricanes in the coming years. But this year's batch did not include the devastating storms of years past and at least one forecaster thinks 1991 will be a calmer year. Gray on Thursday predicted a below-average hurricane season in 1991. 30. In this year's season, there were 14 named storms, eight of them hurricanes. The average number of storms is nine, with about six becoming hurricanes. Storms become hurricanes if winds reach 74 mph.
