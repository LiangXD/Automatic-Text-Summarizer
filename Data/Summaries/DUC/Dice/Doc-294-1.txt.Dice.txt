"This is just a normal day," said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. "There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said Person, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than 25 years. A needle jumped a few inches across the seismograph connected to monitoring equipment in Tonopah, Nev. With a measured eye, he estimated the quake was magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 on the Richter scale. Quick calculations showed the quake was magnitude 3.5, centered about 30 miles southwest of Ely, Nev. Three were in the South Pacific, a 5.9-magnitude shaker near New Caledonia, and quakes of 5.1 and 5.0 in the area of Tonga. A quake of magnitude 2 is about the smallest felt by humans. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. The big San Francisco Bay area quake last year registered 7.1 on the Richter scale. In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said. Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said. Over the years, he has heard countless earthquake predictions. One woman called daily, alerting Person that an earthquake was about to occur, based on the number of birds that crossed her windshield as she drove down the street.
