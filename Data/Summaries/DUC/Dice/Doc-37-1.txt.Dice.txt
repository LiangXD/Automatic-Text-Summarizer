This one will cut a swath across one of the most populous regions of the globe, turning day to night for an estimated 50 million residents in 14 of Mexico's 31 states. The eclipse path reaches from Hawaii through Mexico to Brazil. On July 11, the moon will pass between the planet and the sun, abruptly swallowing midday's light, except for a weird glow on the horizon. People from British Columbia to Buenos Aires will experience at least a partial eclipse. But the special government commission, Eclipse 1991, is banking on the clouds to roll in the country's financial favor. Baja California Sur alone plans to spend $26.5 million for public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in millions more from tourism. Most hotels along the eclipse route are full for July 11. The state says at least four ships will pressed into service as floating hotels. An eclipse is an astronomical coincidence. The National University is developing six half-hour documentaries on eclipses and 10 TV spots on the dangers of looking at the sun, astronomy professor Jesus Galindo says. The government plans to supervise the production of special lenses for viewing an eclipse.
