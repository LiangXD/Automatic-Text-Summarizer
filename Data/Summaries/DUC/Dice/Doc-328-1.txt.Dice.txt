In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, voters were asked whether charges of inappropriate use of government and corporate transportation by Mr. Sununu are so serious that he should resign. Though President Bush says Mr. Sununu's job is safe for now, the ruckus over the chief of staff's extensive use of government and corporate jets and cars has brought to the surface a host of Sununu enemies who are likely to keep gunning for his demise. And while voters aren't clamoring for Mr. Sununu's head, they have formed a more negative impression of him. The survey found that 41% of voters have a negative view of the chief of staff, while just 10% said they have positive feelings. Then, just 20% said they had negative feelings about Mr. Sununu, while 18% reported positive feelings. The poll's findings are likely to fuel arguments by Mr. Sununu's supporters that the controversy over his travel isn't being taken as seriously in the country at large as it is inside Washington. There also is quiet lobbying against Mr. Sununu by Israel's supporters, who long have been suspicious of him because of his links to Arab-American groups and his refusal as governor of New Hampshire to endorse a proclamation condemning a United Nations vote equating Zionism with racism.
