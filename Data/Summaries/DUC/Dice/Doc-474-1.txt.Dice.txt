The Reagan administration may be willing to relax its opposition to an increase in the minimum wage if Congress agrees to dilute the legislation significantly, Labor Secretary William Brock indicated. Mr. Brock said in an interview that exemptions from the minimum wage would be necessary for youths who lack entry-level job skills and for small businesses. Earlier this week, during the Senate Labor Committee's first hearing on a bill to boost the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour in 1990 from the current $3.35, Mr. Brock reiterated his opposition to an increase. I don't want to take a chance that we add to that problem by boosting the minimum wage and thereby pricing young people out of the job market. In yesterday's interview, the secretary suggested the administration might accept a higher minimum wage, though perhaps smaller than in the pending bill, if Congress makes certain changes in the measure. Most House Labor Committee members oppose any youth subminimum wage, the small-business exemption has foundered in the past, and wage-indexing must stay in the bill, a staff official for the panel said. Some congressional labor experts said Mr. Brock personally would like to deal on Capitol Hill for a minimum-wage compromise.
