Canadian Coach Charlie Francis, who claimed that sprinter Ben Johnson's urine sample at the Seoul Olympics was spiked with a banned steroid, told an acquaintance in Seoul that Johnson had worried that he might test positive. Charlie said, 'Ben's more afraid of failing the drug test than he is of Carl Lewis.' Huey said she is tired of hearing Francis, who has been in Toronto testifying at a Canadian inquiry into drug use in sport, say that Johnson was clean at the Olympics. Clean or not, Huey said, Francis must have had some reason to think Ben may not pass the test.
