Only the autonomy talks with the Kurds are considered serious.; IRAQ; MONTHS OF SANCTIONS ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL; IRAQ'S economy was severely damaged by the war, and the trade sanctions imposed by the United Nations shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August are starting to take a toll.; Iraq is allowed to import food and medicine under the sanctions. But until it can export its oil, it will have little cash to obtain reasonably priced supplies of basic necessities.; Many of the goods coming into the country are being bought by private businessmen with hard currency they stockpiled before the war. They must in turn sell the goods at high prices to make a profit.; An ambassador from a Third World country, who spoke on condition of anonymity, predicted that if the sanctions were continued six more months it would increase the threat of internal unrest in Iraq.; President Bush has said the sanctions will remain as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. But so far, there is no clear alternative to Saddam.; In the meantime, government officials have told people to brace for the worst.; Iraqis line up for rationed food and gasoline and try to make ends meet by taking on second jobs.; The official exchange rate for the Iraqi dinar is $3.20. Tea costs 15 times more now than it did then.; The average monthly salary is about 150 dinars, or $480 at the official exchange rate.; Many small factories have closed or reduced operations because of shortages.; Businesses have been told not to expect help from the government and to rely on their own resources.; THE ENVIRONMENT; WAR LEAVES GULF IN ECOLOGICAL RUINS; THE environmental upheaval caused by the Persian Gulf war is of such proportion and complexity that the word disaster seems to trivialize it. The damage is everywhere: in air, water, earth and fire.; Smoke and soot continue to pour from hundreds of oil wells set ablaze by the fleeing army of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.; KUWAIT; WAR-RAVAGED NATION IS SLOW TO REBUILD; KUWAIT is lacking in leadership, stripped of its workforce, gutted of supplies and apparently in little hurry to do anything about it.; Hundreds of homes, shops, offices, schools and power plants have been looted -- but not leveled. About half the old workers were foreigners, especially Palestinians, who either fled the country during the war or have been ordered by the Kuwaiti government to stay off work because of alleged Iraqi sympathies. About 20,000 other Shiites are living in a camp in Saudi Arabia.; In all, roughly a quarter of Iraq's 19 million people were either routed from their homes or lost their jobs as a result of the gulf war, according to estimates from several relief agencies.; In the first major assessment of the war, the environmental group Greenpeace reported last week that as many as 221,000 Iraqi people died as a result of the war and its aftermath. That toll includes: 100,000 to 120,000 Iraqi troops; 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians; 20,000 Kurdish and Shiite insurgents; and 15,000 to 30,000 refugees.; And a team from Harvard University recently visited Iraq and forecast that more than 170,000 children will die in the coming months from disease and war-related traumas.; BURNING WELLS; 500 FIRES STILL RAGE ON KUWAITI OIL FIELDS; Crews capped the 100th well last weekend in the smoke-darkened gloom of Kuwait's blazing oil fields, about 20 wells ahead of schedule.; Oil experts and firefighters are now predicting that at least half the 500 oil fires still blazing could be out by the end of summer.; The four companies fighting the fires estimate that it will take 13 more months to put out all the fires -- a much shorter amount of time than had been feared when the world first glimpsed the awesome spectacle of Kuwait's 600 burning oil wells.; The current pace of two wells per day is expected to slow in the coming weeks, however, as crews turn their attention to the most badly damaged wells.
