A lie detector that measures brain waves would be more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says its developer. "If sensory information has a special meaning for you... then your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the P3 wave," he said. "When they see terms like that, their brain waves break into P3 waves." Rosenfeld has worked on the detector for almost four years and says it could be widely used within three more. However, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would need a great deal more training, Weinstein said.
