When Ms. Leigh exits Thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days inside an airtight, 17,000-cubic foot glass-and-steel structure, she will have been the longest inhabitant of a completely enclosed ecosystem, with air and water generated and recycled independently of Earth's. Ms. Leigh has been living inside a test module for Biosphere II, a $30 million project under construction. "The one thing that I really do miss is just companionship," Ms. Leigh said Wednesday in a telephone interview from within the module, located on a ranch about 30 miles north of Tucson. "I don't think that it's a matter of feeling lonely, but there's just something about direct human contact and sitting with somebody and pouring them a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and having that morning discussion; it's very different than doing it over the phone or over the video," she said. 2, Ms. Leigh has been in frequent daily contact with her outside support team by telephone, video conference, two-way radio and just looking through the glass windows. Her colleagues serenaded her with "Happy Birthday" by video and directed her to gifts hidden in her living area. Samples are passed through a special port for outside analysis, along with samples of waste water and her urine. The rest of the waste water is fed into a marsh recycling system. Ms. Leigh said she hasn't felt isolated because her support team is excellent.
