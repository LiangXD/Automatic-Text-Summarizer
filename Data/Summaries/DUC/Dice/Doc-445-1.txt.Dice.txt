Until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well.; Waves of hot ash; Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.; If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.; In the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered with glowing ash, Lipman said.; Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal. But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash directly toward the base.; The volcano's activity -- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, Lipman said.; The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. But it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base.; Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable size.; No reputable scientist I know of is drawing a connection between the two, Lipman said.; More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical time, he noted.
