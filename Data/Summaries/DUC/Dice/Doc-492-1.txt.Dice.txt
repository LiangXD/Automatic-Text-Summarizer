Powell said that despite changes in the Soviet Union, the Soviets still have the ability to destroy the United States with nuclear weapons. "We must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the enduring realities we face," Powell said. The Soviet Union will remain a superpower well into the next century, Powell said. Powell said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan released earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five years shows "we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal." But the general also defended President Bush's $303.3 billion spending plan for fiscal 1991 as "a realistic, prudent response" to the changing world. The administration budget blueprint, Powell said, will begin to reduce the nation's forces over time. "On this glide path we will reach a base force which I believe is not prudent to go below if we wish to match enduring defense needs with enduring realities," Powell said. We're cutting troops, and believe it or not _ we're cutting generals," Powell said. We need to time to make the plans work," Powell said.
