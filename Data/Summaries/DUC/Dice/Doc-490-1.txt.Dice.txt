Biosphere II will resemble a space colony tethered to Earth. It will be a laboratory for solving environmental problems on Biosphere I _ the Earth _ as well as a prototype for sustaining life outside this world. The crew, all single, consists of: _ Dr. Roy Walford, 66, the oldest crew member and only physician, a research gerontologist, nutritionist and professor of pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine, and the project's medical chief and biomedical consultant. _ Linda Leigh, 38, a botanist who directed and coordinated the project's ecosystem planning for land areas, or biomes, directed the collection and acquisition of more than 2,000 plant species and spent three weeks last fall inside a completely closed test module. _ Bernd Zabel, 41, an electrical engineer from Munich, West Germany, who served as construction general manager for the project. _ Sally Silverstone, 35, a native of Walthamstow, England, who has administered the Space Biospheres Ventures' architectural division. _ Abigail K. Alling, 31, a marine biologist from Maine with degrees from Middlebury College and Yale University who has directed the Biosphere's marine ecological systems. _ Taber Kyle MacCallum, 26, of Albuquerque, N.M., in charge of the Biosphere's analytical laboratory. _ Jane Elizabeth Poynter, 28, a native of Surrey, England, who has been manager of the intensive agriculture system. _ Mark Van Thillo, of Wilrijk-Antwerp, Belgium, who has been in charge of construction quality control. The only link between the dome's ecological system and Earth will be electrical power transmissions, as well as computers and telecommunications.
