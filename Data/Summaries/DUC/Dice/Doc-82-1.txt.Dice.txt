The tuberculosis rate in U.S. prisons may be more than three times higher than on the outside, federal health officials said Thursday, urging testing, isolation and other measures to curb TB behind bars. "In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB has increased dramatically," the CDC said, noting that in New York state there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seven times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78. In New Jersey, inmates had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987, 11 times higher than the general New Jersey population. AIDS tests should be offered to all inmates with known TB infections, the CDC report said.
