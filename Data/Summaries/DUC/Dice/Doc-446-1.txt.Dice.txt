He's able to totally concentrate in those sorts of situations. ; The eruptions at Mount Pinatubo finally gave Harlow the chance to put his skills and experience to work saving lives. Harlow and his team predicted the 1989 eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, but few lives were threatened in the remote area.; Three weeks ago, Harlow joined a team of five U.S. Geological Survey scientists who worked with 10 Filipino scientists to try to forecast the eruption of the volcano, which had been dormant for about 600 years.
