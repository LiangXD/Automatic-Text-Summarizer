The earthquake that killed 25,000 people in Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many, the U.S. Geological Survey reports. The estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an additional 2,000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around the world, the Survey reported Monday. Although the annual average death toll for earthquakes is about 10,000, in 1987 only 1,100 lives were lost. In addition to the deaths, some 13,000 people were injured and more than a half-million were left homeless in the Armenian earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale. That earthquake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale, destroyed thousands of homes and injured many people. 6 an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730 lives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma and China, the Geological Survey reported. The Survey said it recorded 61 significant earthquakes last year, 15 fewer than the year before. An earthquake is considered significant if it has a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale. Earthquakes of lesser magnitude are included if they cause casualties or considerable damage. Three significant earthquakes were recorded in the United States last year, including the strongest shock of the year. Europe recorded three earthquake deaths last year when one rated at 3.0 killed a group of miners in Czechoslovakia on Sept. 5 in an earthquake rated at 5.2. And Japan, usually very seismically active, recorded only one significant earthquake last year, the Survey reported.
