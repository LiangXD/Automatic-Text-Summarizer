A poor ventilation system that does little more than recycle old, stale air from one end of the building to another.; Millions of American office workers are getting more than they bargained for when they inhale in a building that has no fresh air. The evidence comes from various studies of tuberculosis, measles and flu that spread in a manner that can only be explained by poor air ventilation.; Modern office buildings are tight, says Jon Rosenberg, public health officer in California's occupational health program. If it has a good ventilation system... you don't necessarily have to have a sick building, Rosenberg says.; But, alas, many modern ventilation systems recirculate indoor air with little or no fresh air. So the infectious bugs that a worker exhales at one end of the building can end up, via the ventilation system, being inhaled at the other end.; The building is not the source. Respiratory infection experts say that flu viruses and measles are easier to spread than TB.; This particular study deals only with TB, says Dr. Jonathan Samet, a respiratory-disease expert at the University of New Mexico, but the observations may apply to other organisms, such as the respiratory viruses that cause flu. ; Building workers had complained for years about poor air quality.; The building's ventilation system permitted circulation of some outdoor air -- 15 cubic feet per minute -- a low level commonly found in buildings since the 1930s. In those tight buildings, they continue to recirculate it, and they probably build up. ; Nardell and others recognize that the solution to this problem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air -- can be expensive. There's going to be a price of living together in a communal society. ; YOU'RE INTERESTEDEmployees who think that poor air quality at their workplace is contributing to health problems can call Cal-OSHA, a state agency that monitors worker safety and health.
