the research "opens the door to the scientific study of the disease at a level that wasn't possible before and potentially the mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging," he said. amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in type ii diabetes, he said. insulin normally controls the level of blood sugar. in type ii diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body's insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high. type ii diabetes afflicts the majority of the nation's estimated 11 million diabetics, according to the american diabetes association. the new work is "a very important finding" if amylin truly blocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics, f. scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks insulin, but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics, said pi-sunyer, director of the endocrinology, diabetes and nutrition division at st. luke's-roosevelt hospital center in new york.
