as of last month, live pines in the mount palomar area near san diego had less moisture than boards at a lumber yard. firefighting also will be made tougher this year because much of the military reserve and national guard equipment and pilots normally mobilized against wildfires are still in the persian gulf and probably will be there several more months. the area at risk of severe fires spreads beyond california and takes in about a third of the united states mainland, including oregon and washington east of the cascades and much of nevada, arizona, utah, colorado, wyoming, idaho, montana and the dakotas. given the severity of the threat and lack of equipment and water to fight fires, officials throughout the region say they plan an unusually aggressive approach this spring, trying to put out even the smallest wildfires before they spread, and taking preventive measures such as deploying firefighters to an area where lightning storms are forecast. it worked in oregon that approach helped last year in the umatilla national forest in northeastern oregon, where 170 fires were reported, said gordon reinhart, a fire and recreation officer with the u.s. forest service in pendleton, ore. one reason the fire threat is so grave in california is population growth, which has spread suburban development into wilderness areas such as the canyons east of malibu beach, 25 miles from central los angeles, where million-dollar homes sit on brushy hillsides covered with highly flammable greasewood. we are going to have quite a time trying to protect those structures, said paul h. rippens, assistant chief for forestry at the los angeles county fire department.
