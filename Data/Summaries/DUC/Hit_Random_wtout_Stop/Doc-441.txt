mr jg wilson of the local agricultural co-operative says maize farmers in the area - one of the largest maize producing regions - have already lost 80 to 100 per cent of their crops. the maize board, the state marketing board, expects a crop of 4m tonnes, though mr du toit believes it could be closer to 3m or 3.5m, which would make it the worst harvest in 50 years. given the ruling national party's current unpopularity among whites - especially farmers, who are traditionally ultra-conservative - this could prove a serious political blow to the reform process. but the alternative - numerous bankruptcies - could have a serious knock-on effect in several areas. they complain of deteriorating terms of trade, noting that an imported tractor which cost the equivalent of 191 tonnes of maize in 1985, had risen to cost the equivalent of 347 tonnes by 1989-90. low agricultural output will depress overall economic activity, slowing south africa's recovery from a three-year recession. low agricultural output will depress overall economic activity, slowing south africa's recovery from a three-year recession.
