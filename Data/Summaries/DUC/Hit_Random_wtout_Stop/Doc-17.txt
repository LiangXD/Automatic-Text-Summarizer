there are growing signs that hurricane andrew, unwelcome as it was for the devastated inhabitants of florida and louisiana, may in the end do no harm to the re-election campaign of president george bush. after a faltering and heavily criticised initial response to the disaster, both the president and his administration seem finally to be getting assistance to those rendered homeless and to businesses and farms that have been destroyed. his poignant and brief address to the nation on tuesday night, committing the government to pay the emergency relief costs and calling on americans to contribute to the american red cross, also struck the right sort of note. contrary to its brief, but confirming a prescient recent report by a house committee that mr stickney was 'uninterested in substantive programmes', fema was caught completely unprepared by andrew, resulting in unseemly disputes between state and federal authorities over who did what in bringing relief. it was mr baker who reshuffled the president's campaign schedule to make room for visits to the devastated areas and who pushed for a bigger role for the previously obscure mr card. both involve federal subsidies, as does relief for andrew, that run counter to mr bush's commitment to reduce the budget deficit. but both may be presented by a president as being in the national interest because they guarantee employment, which is what the election is largely about.
