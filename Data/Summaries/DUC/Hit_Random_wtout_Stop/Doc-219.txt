the chairman of the house agriculture committee says hearings are planned next year into how the u.s. forest service handled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the west, including one-third of yellowstone national park. de la garza said the hearings would focus on forest fire practices, and "can a catastrophe of that nature be avoided or was it a catastrophe?" the hearings will focus on fire fighting policies, rehabilitation of charred areas and on scientific research being done on the summer fires, said a subcommittee staff member. de la garza says the committee also plans dozens of hearings nationwide in preparation for the 1990 farm bill and will look at the u.s. department of agriculture's response to this year's drought-relief legislation. de la garza said he hopes the house interior committee, which has jurisdiction over the national park service, and the agriculture subcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the u.s. forest service, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, the worst in a century. the most severe were in and around yellowstone and alaska, although there were fires in the south, california and the pacific northwest. drought conditions, high winds and a "tremendous build-up" of tinder, in yellowstone in particular, helped make the 1988 fires the worst in a hundred years, officials said.
