the answer is that judge bork is a neutral-principled judge -- a judge who makes decisions based on established legal principles irrespective of the bottom line of who may win and who may lose. later, in explaining the constitution he helped to forge, alexander hamilton called the judiciary the least dangerous branch, despite the life tenure for federal judges, because it had neither force nor will but merely judgment and because it could take no active resolution whatever in policy matters when that would require a choice among competing legitimate social values. they began, in the words of the late supreme court justice felix frankfurter -- a social liberal but a judicial conservative -- infusing into the vagueness of constitutional or statutory provisions their mere private notions of social policy and traded their black robes of judgment for the mantle of what sociologist david reisman has called omnicompetent arrogance. this bottom-line mentality is why judge bork's nomination is at risk even though judge bork recognizes that constitutional interpretation must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing times. judge bork's elevation to the supreme court would help restore a proper constitutional balance. judge bork's elevation to the supreme court would help restore a proper constitutional balance. judge bork's elevation to the supreme court would help restore a proper constitutional balance.
