although florida republicans are hoping to draft schwarzkopf for a senate bid, he seems unlikely to trade his fatigues for a candidate's general-issue blue suit. but the silky steeliness displayed during the crisis by powell, the first black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has revived discussion of moving vice president dan quayle out to make room for the general on the 1992 republican ticket. but with the gulf war victory so dramatically strengthening bush's re-election prospects -- his approval rating is the highest ever recorded -- few now believe he will dump quayle. and, as the general's career unfolds, democrats should not assume his loyalties lie irrevocably with the gop. powell is, after all, not a product of comfortable suburbia, but a son of jamaican immigrants who was born in harlem, grew up in the south bronx, watched his parents struggle to earn a living as a sales clerk and a seamstress in new york's garment district, attended the public city college of new york and joined the rotc during the 1950s, partly because it was one of the few institutions offering opportunities to blacks. more recently, powell displayed impatience with the progress of that struggle, when he told a congressional committee questioning the large number of minority soldiers in the gulf war that he wish(ed) that there were other activities in our society... as open as the military is to upward mobility, to achievement, to allowing them in. rather, if he choose a political career as a democrat, powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's henry scoop jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions on defending u.s. interests abroad.
