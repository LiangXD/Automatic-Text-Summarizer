the project began with much fanfare in september when four men and four women, accompanied by 3,000 species of plants and animals, sealed themselves inside a eight-story glass structure for a two-year experiment in biological recycling. the voice also said the levels of carbon dioxide in biosphere 2 were becoming dangerously high, apparently because of the decrease in sunlight and the resulting decline in photosynthetic activity by the plants. the voice also said the levels of carbon dioxide in biosphere 2 were becoming dangerously high, apparently because of the decrease in sunlight and the resulting decline in photosynthetic activity by the plants. kathleen dyhr, a biosphere spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview that the group had indeed installed a carbon dioxide remover. the carbon dioxide levels were currently fine, she added, though higher than outside the closed environment. from the start, when planning for the biosphere got under way in the mid-1980s, it was billed as a futuristic experiment in closed recycling where plants and animals would provide each other with all the essentials for life. most especially, green plants would take human wastes (urine, feces and carbon dioxide) and turn them into oxygen, water and food for human consumption.
