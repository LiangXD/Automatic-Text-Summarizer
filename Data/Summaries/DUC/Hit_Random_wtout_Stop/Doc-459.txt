mr lu ping, china's senior official for hong kong affairs, said that if mr patten pressed ahead with his democratic reforms beijing would start a 'new kitchen' in 1997 - a chinese expression which means making a fresh start. speaking at a beijing press conference, he left the door open, however, for further contacts with britain, saying that china 'always stands for co-operation, and not confrontation'. an official added: 'the only sensible way forward is for the two sides to sit down and discuss without preconditions the points of difference between us.' the remarks by mr lu, head of china's hong kong and macao affairs office, were greeted with relief by the hong kong stock market, which had been bracing itself for a more uncompromising stand. the basic law is a mini-constitution for hong kong after 1997 which was approved by china's parliament in 1990. he also refrained from repeating economic threats made by china last year, although it seems unlikely that britain will win china's agreement to complete hong kong's dollars 175bn (pounds 123bn) airport project, or further develop the colony's container port. in beijing, sir robin mclaren, britain's ambassador, regretted the continuing personal attacks on mr patten.
