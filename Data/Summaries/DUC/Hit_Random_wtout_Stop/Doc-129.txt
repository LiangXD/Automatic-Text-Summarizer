bill rodgers, a four-time boston marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at mr. kelley: it's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing. what that means, explains kenneth cooper, the physician who wrote aerobics and several sequels and is now at work on a book on elderly athletes, is that johnny has the body of a man 23 years younger. and finally there's the haunted mile, a stretch where many runners have collapsed. (he doesn't count the miles he puts in, as many long-distance runners obsessively do, but he says he wouldn't object to an estimate of about 50 miles a week.) unlike many runners, mr. kelley doesn't bother with stretching exercises before he runs in the morning. he's a strange man, says laura kelley, in awe of her husband's vigor. he's a strange man, says laura kelley, in awe of her husband's vigor.
