crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s. cotton deliveries are forecast at less than 90,000 tonnes, down from 205,000 tonnes in 1991, soyabeans at 30,000 tonnes (133,000 tonnes last year), while winter wheat production is expected to fall to less than a third of normal levels. cotton deliveries are forecast at less than 90,000 tonnes, down from 205,000 tonnes in 1991, soyabeans at 30,000 tonnes (133,000 tonnes last year), while winter wheat production is expected to fall to less than a third of normal levels. flue-cured tobacco accounts for just over half of this, and while there is likely to be some modest growth in the value of its output this year, the rest, with the exceptions of beef and horticulture will fall catastrophically so much so that, in real terms, farm output in 1992 is projected to slump to its lowest levels for 30 years. next year's crop and livestock production will remain below average - even if good rains fall - as early plantings will be reduced because of a lack of irrigation. next year's crop and livestock production will remain below average - even if good rains fall - as early plantings will be reduced because of a lack of irrigation. after a drought-induced surge this year caused by destocking, beef production will fall sharply as cattlemen rebuild their herds.
