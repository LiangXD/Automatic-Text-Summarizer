dell, the santa barbara city fire department, the city government and a number of volunteers combined their efforts and began planning the santa barbara firescapes demonstration garden to educate the public about reducing the risks of wildfire near their homes. the garden is a model of how to design and maintain landscaping around the home to provide a line of defense against fire. the garden is landscaped into four plant zones, with the most flammable vegetation planted farthest from the house. one popular plant found almost everywhere in southern california -- ice plant -- would seem to be an ideal choice for a firescape garden. one popular plant found almost everywhere in southern california -- ice plant -- would seem to be an ideal choice for a firescape garden. as dell sees it, while many home gardeners have learned to deal with low-water conditions, they've virtually ignored another common southern california occurrence -- wildfire. just as appropriate landscaping can help gardeners with water shortages, so may careful landscaping help reduce the risk of significant property damage in the most fire-prone areas.
