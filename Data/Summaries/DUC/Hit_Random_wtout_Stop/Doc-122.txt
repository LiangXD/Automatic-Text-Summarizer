virginia's version, later copied by new york and north carolina, brought together three elements in one article -- affirmation of a right to bear arms, reliance on state militia, and opposition to a standing army: that the people have a right to keep and bear arms that a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state that standing armies, in times of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided.... what right must not be infringed? what right must not be infringed? the senate in turn gave it its final form, briefer, unfortunately more elliptical, and with the exemption for conscientious objectors deleted: a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. the senate in turn gave it its final form, briefer, unfortunately more elliptical, and with the exemption for conscientious objectors deleted: a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. but what about the private right to keep and bear arms, to own a gun for self-defense and hunting? well, for example, it means that congress has the constitutional power to enact a militia act of 1992, to require every person who owns a gun or aspires to own one to enroll in the militia.
