reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his administration's economic record, saying friday's unemployment figures showed that the jobless rate "hovered just above the lowest it's been in 14 years." the figures from the labor department showed unemployment of 5.6 percent, up from 5.4 percent in july and from the may figure of 5.3 per cent, which was a 14-year low. "but there are still some americans whom our expansion has passed by _ those caught in the welfare trap," he said. to deal with this, he said, his administration launched a program encouraging states to come up with their own plans to get people off the welfare rolls. "if congress presents me with a bill that replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of self-sufficiency through work out of the reach of americans on welfare, i will use my veto pen." downey said that while more people than ever before are working, "the fact is that the typical worker in america is no better off today than he or she was 10 years ago in fact things have gotten worse." the poorest 40 percent of american families, with incomes adjusted for inflation, are worse off today than they were 10 years ago the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decade ago and 32.5 million americans remain mired in poverty, he said.
