proposals to limit the terms of members of congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls. for example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections. term limitations won't improve the functioning of the legislature, either. term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who surround them. term limits merely guarantee that the good will disappear along with the bad. finally, term limitations won't enhance representative democracy. more likely, groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term limitations to improve their chances of winning office.
