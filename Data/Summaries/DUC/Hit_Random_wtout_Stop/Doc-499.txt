but he also is an experienced bureaucratic player who is skilled at operating the national-security system. as a result, gen. powell, named the new national security adviser last week, appears to be the right man for the job at this stage of the reagan administration. gen. powell, who has been serving as deputy national security adviser, fits the bill. secretary of state george shultz and frank carlucci, the current national security adviser and mr. reagan's nominee to become secretary of defense, are both better known in congress and will be more visible, selling the pending arms-control treaty and other administration policies. gen. powell, a genial and plain-spoken 50-year-old, is one of a special breed of washington figures: he is well known within the tightly knit national security establishment, yet largely unknown to the rest of the nation. recently, gen. powell has told visitors that the national security council staff should function as a collegial infantry batallion. it isn't a term a grandiloquent national security adviser like henry kissinger would have used, but it's an indicator of the kind of efficient and noncontroversial nsc operation gen. powell can be expected to run.
