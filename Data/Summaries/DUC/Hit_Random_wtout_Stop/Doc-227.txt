this rise of illegal mining, particularly in the cuango region, which produces 80 per cent of angola's diamonds and some of its highest-quality gem stones, started in may, 1991, after the peace accord which allowed freedom of movement for the first time in 16 years. the onset of the dry season and the fall in river levels from the end of may this year has encouraged what de beers, the south african group that dominates the world diamond business, describes as 'a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply of illicit angolan diamonds reaching the market'. de beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market through 'sights' offered by the cso ten times a year to about 160 selected buyers. they are offered boxes of diamonds, each worth between dollars 500,000 and dollars 25m. 'what the cso for many years has done successfully, is to operate a buffer pool, stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand is in excess of the level of supply. in this way it has been able to preserve an essential degree of stability in the price of this ultimate luxury of gem diamonds, to the common advantage of producers, processors and consumers of this unique natural product.' in this way it has been able to preserve an essential degree of stability in the price of this ultimate luxury of gem diamonds, to the common advantage of producers, processors and consumers of this unique natural product.'
