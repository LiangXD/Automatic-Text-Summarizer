mr kraai van niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on continued political reform in south africa, and prieska is the centre of his constituency. it is, in fact, the arable farmers further east who are suffering most, as i had seen and heard for myself a few days earlier, and mr van niekerk has already set up committees of bankers, extension officers and local farmers' representatives, to try to find ways to avoid many of them going bankrupt. to allow vast numbers of farms to go out of business at a time when there is little enthusiasm, even among successful farmers for expansion, would put tens of thousands of black farm labourers out of work. some commentators have suggested that the port facilities are inadequate to handle such volumes within the time available but mr van niekerk assured me that his department had done the calculations and confirmed that they can and that imports have already begun to arrive. but back in the orange free state, last week, farmers were worrying about the continued absence of any rain to provide moisture to germinate wheat seeds when they were due to be planted in a few weeks time. as the minister said, that is a long way ahead and there will be time to make arrangements to deal with that problem should it occur. but in the meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the south african budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow.
