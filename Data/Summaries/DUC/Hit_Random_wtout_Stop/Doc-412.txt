someone set a fire early today in a storage room on the luxury liner regent star, five days after the ship ran aground in delaware bay because of another fire that cut off power, authorities said. the 20,000-ton liner was on its way from jamaica to philadelphia on sunday when a small fire prompted a power loss, allowing the ship to drift onto a sandbar. the 885 passengers left the ship by ferry monday, a day after they were supposed to return. thursday, coast guard petty officer ken beatty said the ship passed all inspections and there was no serious damage from the grounding. the ship had been due to start on a two-day cruise later today, but that was canceled after the second fire broke out, authorities said. an hour after this morning's fire was controlled, about 300 crew members sat or stood in small groups alongside the port of history museum where the ship was tied up. many still wearin the orange life preservers they had put om when they abandoned the ship.
