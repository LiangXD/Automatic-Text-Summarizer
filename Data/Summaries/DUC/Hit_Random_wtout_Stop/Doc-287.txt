"we also are working on the idea of putting this braided fabric in concrete as reinforcing material instead of metal rods," he said. the fibers, including kevlar now used to make bulletproof vests, also could be used to make some body parts, and el-shiekh is working with duke university researchers on ceramic "stents," collapsible braces for arteries. "the possibilities are limitless." said el-shiekh, who can produce shapes ranging from hollow cubes to panels that have openings for wiring and conduits already braided into them. "the big problem is cost and that's why we're working on this automated machinery." </text> <head>ers now seeing effects of changing type of coke addiction</head> <dateline>boston (ap) </dateline> <text> it's 8 p.m. and a dozen people wait in the lobby of boston city hospital's emergency room.
