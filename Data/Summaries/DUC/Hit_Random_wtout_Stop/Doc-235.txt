william daley is younger brother and chief adviser to chicago's mayor richard m daley and offspring of the legendary democratic machine 'boss', the late richard j daley. unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother, 45-year-old bill daley is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator with important connections in washington and long-standing ties with organised labour. mr daley accepted the nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet position and turning down an offer to be mr clinton's chief negotiator at the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva. clinton needs someone with political sense to move this thing through congress, and daley has the connections,' says a fellow washington lobbyist. mr daley's talents have been summoned, insiders say, to convince moderate democrats to back the agreement. mr clinton may be banking on mr daley's union ties to help the nafta effort. mr jim jontz, former congressman from indiana and director of the anti-nafta citizen's trade campaign, said: 'i don't know why bill daley would want to be in a position like that.
