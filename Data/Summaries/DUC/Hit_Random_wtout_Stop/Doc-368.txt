one reason why is that robert bork, former marine, former practicing lawyer, former yale professor of law, former solicitor general, former professor at yale again, former judge of the u.s. circuit of appeals, is now a best-selling writer. to his surprise, "the tempting of america, the political seduction of the law," has been on the best-seller list for more than 10 weeks, and there are more than 190,000 copies in print. his strict constructionist views of the constitution threatened the inclusion of women's rights under the 14th amendment, and evoked a public outcry from blacks and labor. bork has plans for perhaps two more books, one in more academic detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools, and another on the relationship of law and the culture. he will hit the lecture circuit this spring and fall and will teach a constitutional law course next year at george mason university. at his bedside table are mysteries, his other pastime, martha grimes, dorothy sayers, john dickson carr, margery allingham. bork enjoys the atmosphere at the american enterprise institute, the conservative think tank that has become his small university.
