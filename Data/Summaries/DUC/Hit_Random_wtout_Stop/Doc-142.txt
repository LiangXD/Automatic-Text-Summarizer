third world debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service their debts to the united states and other creditors last year than they received in new loans -- a major drain on their already cash-strapped economies -- the world bank reported sunday. the cash drain has been growing steadily since 1984, when it was $10.2 billion. the bank said that it plans to increase its own commitments for new loans to third world countries to about $16.4 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $14.8 billion in fiscal 1988. the figures on the cash drain showed that these net resource transfers, as the bank parlance terms them, are mushrooming rapidly -- a measure of the mounting strain that the global debt burden is placing on third world economies. the debt service for this total -- that is, the payments to cover interest and principal -- amounts to about $143 billion a year. the bank said the continuing deterioration in the debt situation underscores the need for further efforts by the industrial countries to help third world governments pare back their debt -- a major aim of the u.s. plan offered by treasury secretary nicholas f. brady. drain began in 1984 however, efforts under the brady plan are going relatively slowly, and world bank officials cautioned that the results may not show up for at least two or three more years.
