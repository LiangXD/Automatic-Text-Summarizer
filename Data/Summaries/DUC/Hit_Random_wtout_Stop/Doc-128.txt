we have many rights not enumerated in the constitution, such as the right to marry, drive a car or own a dog. these rights are not denied just because the constitution doesn't mention them and the rights are not disparaged by the fact that we must obtain a marriage license, driver's license or a dog license. in the same way, the right to own a gun is not disparaged by being licensed or otherwise regulated and controlled. requiring gun owners to register with the national guard would provide the kind of scrutiny the brady and staggers bills contemplated, and, if congress dared, could provide an additional measure of control over who owns what kinds of weapons. consistent with all of the bill of rights, its subject is rights, not duties. and since the proliferation of guns in the hands of criminals has become a national calamity, as police officials all over the nation attest, it is essential that we recapture the true purpose of the second amendment. and since the proliferation of guns in the hands of criminals has become a national calamity, as police officials all over the nation attest, it is essential that we recapture the true purpose of the second amendment.
