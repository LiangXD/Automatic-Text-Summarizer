-- more than 90% of police chiefs and sheriffs surveyed agree that criminals are not affected by a ban on any type of firearm, while more than 70% oppose waiting periods for the same reason. -- a prisoner survey conducted by james d. wright et al. found that unarmed felons listed tougher penalties for using a gun as an important reason for not arming themselves. -- 75%-80% of u.s. violent crimes are committed by career criminals, many on some form of conditional or early release (30%-35% of career criminals are rearrested with previous criminal charges still pending). -- gary kleck found that using a gun for protection from violent crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- reduces the likelihood that the crime will be completed and that intended victims will be injured. is how these people killed themselves the real issue, or is why more important? is how these people killed themselves the real issue, or is why more important? the nra has not acted prudently and is alienating the support and respect of many legislators, police departments and its members. i find it incongruous that the president of nbc news, a man who should believe in the broadening of constitutional rights, obviously has no regard for the second amendment rights to keep and bear arms. mr. gartner ignores the key issues regarding suicide and crime. thus the well-organized militia phrase in the second amendment was not intended to restrict arms to those in the militia -- as the anti-gun lobby would have us believe.
