sir, mr james skinner (letters, april 11) charges me with misuse of statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries. the debts of african countries have often been cancelled or rescheduled, frequently several times for the same country. these factors include, among others, government policies and extensive, often enforced, dependence on precarious subsistence production. an arab-dominated sudanese government will not help the poorest blacks hundreds of miles away with whom it is in armed conflict the sinhalese government will not help the tamil poor, nor will the government of ethiopia the poor of tigre. as i said in my letter, harping on alleged western causes of third world poverty reflects and reinforces feelings of guilt, which is a self-centred sentiment. as i said in my letter, harping on alleged western causes of third world poverty reflects and reinforces feelings of guilt, which is a self-centred sentiment. encouraging third world countries to default inhibits the inflow of productive commercial capital, which, together with the skills that went with it, over the last 150 years transformed life in many poor countries, notably in south-east asia, west africa and latin america.
