this string of actions is the inevitable result of the change of britain's policies toward china and its stubborn perseverance in violating the sino-british joint declaration, the principle of convergence with the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region and the relevant agreements and understandings reached between the two countries. first, patten tabled his political reform bill in october, 1992, in a sudden manner, without consulting with china, thus sabotaging the sino-british consultations and cooperation of the past ten years since they negotiated and signed the joint declaration, and bringing about a half-year-long open argument between the two countries. later, when the two sides almost reached identical views on the arrangements for elections of municipal councils and the district boards, the british side intentionally confused these elections with that of the legislative council and unilaterally terminated the talks and then introduced the first part of the package to the legislative council last december. over the past year or more, patten has directed so many farces which converged so closely that it is clear that what he did was carefully arranged and long premeditated. however, patten hurriedly put forward his political reform bill less than three months after he began to serve as hong kong governor, without absorbing opinions from the hong kong residents. more serious was that, despite strong appeals from hong kong residents for the settlement of the electoral arrangements through talks, the political reform bill submitted by patten was passed. in accordance with these provisions, the chinese side has reiterated that as component parts of the british political body administering hong kong, the last british-hong kong district boards, the two municipal polls and the legislative council will definitely be terminated together with the end of the british administration of hong kong.
