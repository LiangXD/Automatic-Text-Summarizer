mr harry oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls the anglo american corporation of south africa and de beers, is to visit russia next week at a time when the republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamond industry. however, it admitted that mr oppenheimer would be meeting senior officials from the russian diamond industry during his stay because he would be going to some of the big mines in siberia and would be present when de beers held the formal opening of its moscow office on september 8. de beers' london-based central selling organisation, which controls about 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, in 1990 signed a dollars 5bn, five-year sales contract with the former soviet union and at the same time advanced a loan of dollars 1bn. after the break-up of the soviet union the contract was continued with rosalmazzoloto, the russian gold and diamond organisation, and an exclusive sales agreement was later signed with yukutia, the area in eastern siberia where most russian diamonds are mined and which is now an autonomous republic in the russian federation. diamantaire points out that the russian parliament is to consider next month a plan to set up a state diamond centre under the control of the finance ministry and komdragmet, formerly know as gokhran, the moscow depository of diamonds. reports suggest that the diamond centre would have exclusive rights to buy all rough diamonds mined in the russian federation and it would also have a monopoly of sorting gem diamonds. meanwhile, the newsletter, which is available only to subscribers to diamond international magazine, also says that reports in antwerp suggest that two of the belgian diamond trading organisations with which the cso has a special relationship have been punished by temporarily being excluded from the cso's 'sights' or diamond sales.
