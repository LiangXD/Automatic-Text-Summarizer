in july he said there would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of which six would be hurricanes. mr. gray said the west african sahel region is the newest of five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane activity. atlantic hurricanes form from especially strong tropical storms that are triggered by winds and other air disturbances that sweep across africa. comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the sahel with the number of high-powered atlantic hurricanes, mr. gray found a striking correlation. from 1947 to 1969, for instance, rainfall in the western sahel was especially abundant, and during this time there were 13 severe hurricanes that formed in the atlantic ocean. from 1970 to 1988, the sahel suffered through a terrible drought, and hurricane activity was unusually low only one severe hurricane, gloria in 1985, formed in the area. he based his 1990 storm forecast on the higher-than-normal rainfall in the sahel in july.
