men who smoke heavily are nearly twice as likely as nonsmokers to die from a common form of leukemia, concludes a report by the university of edinburgh. the analysis, based on a previous study of 248,046 u.s. veterans, offers the firmest link yet between cigarette consumption and the disease. the report in tomorrow's british medical journal may well have an emotional impact on some people who are vacillating about quitting smoking and for one reason or another have a fear of leukemia, suggested nicholas wald, an epidemiologist at the medical college of st. bartholomew's hospital here. dr. kinlen, who directs the university's cancer epidemiology unit, examined leukemia deaths from a u.s. study that had tracked veterans' smoking between 1954 and 1969. dr. kinlen found veterans who had smoked more than 21 cigarettes a day were the most likely to die from myeloid leukemia, the most common form of the disease in middle-aged people. these heavy smokers had a 93% greater chance of developing fatal leukemia than the veterans who never had smoked. and men using fewer than 10 cigarettes daily were 31% more likely to die from leukemia than nonsmokers, according to the report.
