critics say the tangle of commuter lines in southeast england, so obsolete that trains can be delayed by a sudden fall of autumn leaves, will delay tunnel traffic. the consortium forecasts 16.5 million passengers in 1993 but the railroad says that figure will not be reached before 1998. arriving channel trains will terminate at waterloo station in south london, at a large customs and immigration terminal. britain's entry into the european economic community engendered a spirit of unity and the digging began again in 1974, but two years later a new british government shelved the project. eurotunnel ordered a management shakeup and threatened trans-manche link, the consortium of 10 british and french engineering companies building the tunnel, with penalties of $25 million if the diggers did not pass the three-mile mark by nov. eurotunnel will run shuttle trains once every three minutes at peak times between terminals near folkestone and calais, and british rail and the frenh state railroad will operate trains from london and paris. cars and trucks will drive onto the shuttle trains and be able to stay in their vehicles or stroll about during the 35-minute tunnel passage.
