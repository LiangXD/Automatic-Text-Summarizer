the zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse). the infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown, but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others. it is more likely, the scientists believe, that an unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and was passed along, as with more mundane infections. because of the danger to other animals, the kudu herd has been isolated. the scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows. if, however, it turned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form, the case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger. if, however, it turned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form, the case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger.
