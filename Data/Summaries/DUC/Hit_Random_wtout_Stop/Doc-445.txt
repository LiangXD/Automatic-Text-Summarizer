scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the mount unzen volcano in japan, he said. mount pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the ring of fire on the pacific coasts of asia and the americas. (these volcanoes -- including mount lassen in the sierra nevada, and mount rainier and mount st. helens in the cascade range -- arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.) pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as mount st. helens did when it erupted in 1980. if it does have a massive eruption, pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path. but it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base. volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be linked to the volcano in japan, which is of comparable size.
