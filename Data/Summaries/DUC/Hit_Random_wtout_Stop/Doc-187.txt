many coastal communities, with swelling populations, are ill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said robert sheets, director of the national hurricane center. the only thing we can do is work on better preparedness and emergency planning." the aftermath from hurricane gilbert in 1988 and hugo last year taught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate and protect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from maine to texas, sheets said. gilbert killed more than 300 people and caused heavy damage from the lesser antilles to mexico. both gilbert and hugo reached category 5, according to meteorologist barry fatchwell of the national hurricane center. also, he said hugo showed inadequacies in the emergency broadcast system and some communities used emergency shelters ill-suited to withstand a powerful hurricane. in the caribbean, officials have worked to improve communications systems after links were cut by gilbert.
