in the type of leukemia suffered by the patients, white blood cells have turned malignant at an immature stage of cell development. the tretinoin used in the leukemia patients, however, is a pill that was prepared for the experiment by chemists at hoffmann-la roche inc., the u.s. arm of roche holding ltd. of switzerland. the particular form of leukemia that appears to respond readily to the acne-drug type of treatment is called acute promyelocytic leukemia. until now, chemotherapy with standard anti-cancer drugs has been the only effective treatment for acute promyelocyltic leukemia, but it produces cures in only about a third of patients. the tip-off that an tretinoin-like drug might be effective in treating the leukemia came from a genetic finding, dr. raymond p. warrell jr. of memorial sloan-kettering and his colleagues in new york and at m.d. anderson cancer center in houston reported in this week's new england journal of medicine. most patients with promyleocytic leukemia apparently have the same defect in two of their 23 chromosomes, the structures in the cell that contain all the genes. a piece of chromosome number 17 appears to have broken loose and become a part of chromosome number 15.
