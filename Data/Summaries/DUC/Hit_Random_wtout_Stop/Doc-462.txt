in reponse, patten showed his ignorance and arrogance, once again proving that the british government is bent on making the hong kong issue an international one before evacuating hong kong and changing hong kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity, to extend the influence of its colonial rule. <h5> sovereignty over hong kong cannot be evaded </h5> ostensibly, some people feel governor patten's remarks, quoted at the beginning of this article, were made in praise of hong kong and in defense of hong kong's international status and its importance. they tried to change hong kong into an international political wrestling ring in a bid to throw hong kong into confusion, cripple hong kong's superiority as an international financial center, and rely on international forces to prevent china regaining sovereignty over hong kong. how can patten be compared with the chinese government where the understanding of hong kong's international status and its importance are concerned. how can patten be compared with the chinese government where the understanding of hong kong's international status and its importance are concerned. it is because the chinese government has a profound and accurate understanding of hong kong's past and present state, and its international status, that it was able to advance a series of principles and policies including one country, two systems, allowing hong kong people to administer hong kong and enjoy a high degree of autonomy, and so on to solve hong kong problems. the fact that the chinese government included the series of principles and policies into the sino-british joint declaration, which was made known to the world, giving them concrete form and putting them on a legal basis in the basic law, vividly indicates that the chinese government has a penetrating understanding of hong kong's international status. by falsely alleging that the chinese side does not understand hong kong's international status, he obviously was trying to shift public attention, cheat the media, and lure the international community into meddling in hong kong affairs, thus finally attaining the goal of internationalizing the hong kong issue. <h3> the british side has attempted to prolong colonial rule for a long time </h3> internationalizing the hong kong issue is one of the british government's important plans to continue its colonial rule over hong kong after 1997 and is also one of its concentrated examples of going back on its word after signing the sino-british joint declaration.
