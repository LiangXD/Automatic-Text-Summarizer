tapia said: the shining path was defeated, but it seems that after the beginning of negotiations, abimael guzman's leadership has been consolidated, tied to the commitment to organize a second party congress. tapia believes the government is seeking to strengthen abimael guzman's leadership within shining path, countering the hardline faction led by alberto ramirez durand, aka feliciano. guzman's faction, tapia said, represents the imprisoned shining path, while the one led by feliciano is made up of the terrorists who are still free. the statements were made in the wake of a letter that shining path member edmundo cox addressed to colonel gabino cajahuanca, the director of the miguel castro castro prison, asking him for an audience to inform you about what we have done. cox was referring to the meetings he held with imprisoned shining path members in other prisons of the country to support the peace proposal by guzman reinoso, against the faction led by feliciano. cox was referring to the meetings he held with imprisoned shining path members in other prisons of the country to support the peace proposal by guzman reinoso, against the faction led by feliciano. carlos tapia, who is a careful observer of the subversion phenomenon, believes that the shining path does not seek national reconciliation, and that it maintains its ideological positions, such as hatred of classes and its stand against the legal leftist sector, human rights organizations, popular unions, and nongovernmental organizations.
