the senate today confirmed conservative civil rights official clarence thomas as a federal appeals judge, brushing aside complaints about his record from some liberal and senior citizens groups. as chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission over the last eight years, he has been one of the most visible black officials in the reagan and bush administrations. it became clear monday night that thomas' critics had failed to muster enough support to defeat his nomination. danforth, thomas' chief senate supporter and former employer, said he could vouch for the nominee's abilities as a lawyer. simpson said the panel's investigation of the employment commission was flawed to begin with. thomas was born in poverty in rural georgia, worked his way through college and is a graduate of yale law school. before becoming chairman of the commission, he worked under danforth in the missouri attorney general's office and in the senate as well for the monsanto corp.
