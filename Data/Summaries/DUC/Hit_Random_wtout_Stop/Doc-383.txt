a state court of appeal ruled monday that cities and counties may require applicants for jobs as police officers to submit to polygraph tests about their character and background. (municipalities) have a compelling governmental interest in conducting a comprehensive background investigation and in utilizing the polygraph examination to protect the public from applicants who may be attempting to conceal undetected criminal activity, racial prejudice, sexual aberrance or violent tendencies, appellate justice james f. perley wrote for the court. the panel noted that the right to privacy was not absolute -- and said that a city's interest in ensuring its officers were of the highest integrity outweighed any harm suffered by an applicant who loses a job opportunity for refusing the test. cities have an interest in making sure they hire the right candidates for jobs that have important powers in this society, he said. richard l. pinckard, a deputy city attorney representing san diego and three other cities backing vallejo in the case, said the ruling was especially important in view of state laws barring polygraph exams for officers already on the job. a solano county superior court rejected rust's claims and the court of appeal, in its ruling monday, affirmed that ruling, concluding that both applicants -- and ex-officers seeking reinstatement -- could be required to take the tests as a condition for getting the job. in dissent, appellate justice marc poche said that ex-officers like rust should be treated like officers holding jobs and be protected against involuntary testing when they seek reinstatement.
