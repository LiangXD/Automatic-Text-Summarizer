just as he said in his article, the reason is that what he has done since he became governor of hong kong has been criticized and condemned not only by china and people of hong kong, but also by people in britain. the most important point of the article is that chris patten was trying hard to explain that all he had done was in the interests of the hong kong people. but for the hong kong people, of course the hong kong chinese, what should be put first is certainly that they should be treated as real chinese people of china rather than a conquered people in a colony, and the first responsibility of britain is to ensure a smooth return of hong kong to china in accordance with the sino-british joint declaration. in fact, responsibility toward the citizens of hong kong advocated by chris patten is actually for the colonialist interests of the british empire. people will also ask: why will the position of britain in china and asia be decided by how britain discharges its responsibility in hong kong in a dignified manner? chris patten, the last governor of hong kong, has been trying hard to preserve an actual colonial position in hong kong and revitalize the colonialist power and prestige of the old british empire. this article is actually a confession by chris patten, who has been driven to the wall, to prove his loyalty to british colonialism.
