from a helicopter, the wave-washed beach looks as if the worst oil spill in u.s. history had never touched it. the pungent odor of petroleum wafts through the air as the hole turns black with crude oil, an oozing remnant of the 10.8 million gallons spilled into prince william sound last march 24 by the tanker exxon valdez. workers found more than 1,000 dead otters, a sizable chunk of the spill area's total population of 15,000 to 22,000. "we never claimed that the spill put any animal on the endangered species list, but that's missing the point," said fish and wildlife spokesman bruce batten. assessment studies for these populations are not finished, and even preliminary findings are hard to come by _ researchers have been told by lawyers to save their findings for court, where it seems nearly everyone involved in the spill is headed. the state sued, claiming the company was negligent in responding to the spill, only to be countersued by exxon, which claimed state officials hindered the use of chemical dispersants that could have broken up large quantities of oil early on. information about the spill is filtered through this litigious atmosphere, making much of it suspect.
