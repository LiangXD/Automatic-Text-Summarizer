a major issue hanging over the 1990 census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas, but congress is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens. while aliens have been counted in the past, military personnel stationed overseas have not. the commerce department settled that problem by announcing it will work with the defense department on ways to count the 1.2 million to 1.6 million military and civilian defense workers who live overseas. that has yet to be decided, but possibilities include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last state where he or she lived for at least six months. tom ridge, r-pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 million to run the state, justice and commerce departments next year, including $800 million to take the census. "congress is empowered to identify those to be counted" in the census, responded ridge. census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete illegal aliens, contending they cannot determine who is in the country legally.
