steve cowper on thursday threatened to close down the trans-alaska oil pipeline unless its owners meet his terms for improved safety and cleanup measures. equipment must be dedicated to oil-spill cleanup only. -- the names of 12 oil spill-response team members who do nothing but respond to oil spills and who are available for such duty 24 hours a day. installation of booms -- the installation of containment booms around all oil tankers in the harbor. -- permanent restriction of tanker traffic to daylight hours. -- a limit of one tanker being loaded at a time until all designated cleanup equipment is in place, and the end of all loading within 72 hours if cleanup equipment is not ready. -- demonstration by april 30 of adequate gear and supplies to handle another 10-million-gallon spill. state law gives the governor the authority to close the terminal if it does not meet state oil-cleanup plan requirements. even if cowper's shutdown were found to illegally interfere with interstate commerce and be overturned in court, it could last long enough to drive home a point about improving cleanup response plans. alyeska also suggested expanding the coast guard's radar system, which had been scaled down as a cost-saving measure in the early 1980s, and offered to keep on hand additional equipment to contain, skim and disperse spills. meanwhile, the chairman of exxon corp. told congress thursday that the third mate who was on the bridge of the exxon valdez when it ran aground has told company lawyers that he turned off the ship's automatic pilot in an effort to avoid the reef.
