whatever they did in iowa, they will not reject george bush in new hampshire, sununu vowed, as he dragged bush down from his elite perch to start what he called a see me, touch me, feel me campaign. sununu embodied the barbed-wire side of bush's politics in many critical ways, he was an accurate reflection of the way bush believed things should work. during the 1988 campaign, bush conceded in interviews that he had to do some of the dirty work in attacking dukakis his alternating nice and nasty faces came to be known as george the gentle and george the ripper. while sununu's lack of political skill in dealing with political washington eventually cost him his job, and while his fatal flaw may have been in believing that he was smarter than george bush, the chief of staff was -- often in an inept way -- trying to fulfill the mandate he had been given by his boss. while sununu's lack of political skill in dealing with political washington eventually cost him his job, and while his fatal flaw may have been in believing that he was smarter than george bush, the chief of staff was -- often in an inept way -- trying to fulfill the mandate he had been given by his boss. as bush tried to be the ultimate washington insider, the chief of staff alienated congress, cabinet members, house republicans and the press, who disdained sununu because they believed he misled them. his approval ratings began dropping again, important republicans scorned by sununu began going on the record with their advice to bush that he was being ill served by his chief of staff, and finally and most important, the president's wife, barbara, and oldest son, george, turned on sununu.
