(this line-up would occur at every new moon, except that the moon's orbit is tilted so it only crosses the sun's path every six months.) because of variations in the moon's orbit, fewer than a third of the solar eclipses are total eclipses. in these cases the moon's shadow, up to 200 miles wide on the earth's surface, races west to east along the ground at 1,000 to 5,000 miles per hour for a few thousand miles. but when the shadow's narrow path does cross inhabited areas, people flock there to experience totality -- to watch the light snap off and the stars snap on, and to gaze at the sun's shaggy corona hanging in the dark sky for a few minutes before daylight abruptly returns. this thursday the moon's shadow will be back for another performance, one of the century's best. this thursday the moon's shadow will be back for another performance, one of the century's best. also, its 150-mile-wide path across hawaii, baja california, mexico city and four central american capital cities puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history, says alan dyer, an editor of astronomy magazine.
