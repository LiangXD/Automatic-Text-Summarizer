monday's parliamentary declaration provides for establishing an independent legal system that would take precedence over federal laws and for slovenian control over armed forces stationed in the republic, state media said. a coalition of center-right parties formed a new government last month in slovenia, the most prosperous of yugoslavia's six republics, after trouncing reform communists in the first free state elections held in communist-ruled yugoslavia in 45 years. they threaten that slovenia will declare full independence from yugoslavia if the remaining republics do not accept its proposals for a confederation. the slovenian declaration also said police should take over control of frontiers with neighboring italy and austria, replacing border guards deployed for the past 45 years by yugoslavia's communist government, ljubljana tv said. it said the state would establish its own intelligence and counter-intelligence services, that would be independent of their communist-controlled federal counterparts. slovenia's president, milan kucan, has said that slovenia intends to proclaim sovereignty as part of its drive for liberal political and economic reform in yugoslavia. in kosovo's capital of pristina, after serbian police on monday barred about 100 ethnic albanian deputies from entering the province's parliament, about 40 deputies proclaimed kosovo equal to the six yugoslav republics.
