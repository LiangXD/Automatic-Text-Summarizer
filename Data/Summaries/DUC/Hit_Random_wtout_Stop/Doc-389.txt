here are excerpts of the speech to the security council on thursday by foreign minister ali-akbar velayati of iran, delivered in farsi and translated by the iranian mission: in the morning of sunday july 2, 1988, families and friends of 290 passengers and crew said farewell to their loved ones in tehran and bandar abbas airports _ unaware of the dastardly attack that awaited them, unaware of the tragic destiny that would be imposed upon them by a reckless and incompetent naval force led by aggressive and expansionist policy-makers. the plane was flying on a scheduled flight using the internationally established and published amber 59 airway that is used at least 14 times a week, five of which between the same two airports. uss vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as american officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from bandar abbas to dubai. while every available evidence including the transcripts read earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any warning, many have contended that in such a short and routine flight, the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency civilian frequency. furthermore, because the ship failed to identify the target of its alleged warnings, the pilot of the airliner of a scheduled flight should not have reasonably taken it as directed against himself. furthermore, positioning itself right in the middle of an international civil airway, it is ironic that the ship expected the plane to go outside of the corridor, not be coming onto the vincennes. furthermore, positioning itself right in the middle of an international civil airway, it is ironic that the ship expected the plane to go outside of the corridor, not be coming onto the vincennes.
