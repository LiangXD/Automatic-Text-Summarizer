the world bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issued today by mr lewis preston, the bank's president. the link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990s. in the directive, mr preston says poverty reduction is 'the benchmark by which our performance as a development institution will be measured'. the directive signals an attempt to impose a form of 'social conditionality' on borrowing countries. mr preston's emphasis on poverty is a reaction to bank policies in the 1980s, when the aim was to improve economic efficiency in developing countries. the new directive says structural adjustment lending in the past decade 'overshadowed the bank's poverty reduction objectives'. the bank is also reacting to new evidence suggesting that the number of poor in developing countries will rise during the 1990s, rather than stabilise as had been expected.
