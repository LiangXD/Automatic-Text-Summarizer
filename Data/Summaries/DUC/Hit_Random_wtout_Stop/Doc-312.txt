even before biden rapped the opening gavel, thomas' nomination triggered a confirmation battle more akin to a political campaign -- television commercials, endorsements by dozens of groups for and against, and a daily drumbeat of support from president bush. abortion aside, thomas also is expected to be questioned about his views on civil rights -- especially affirmative action -- and the right of privacy. edward m. kennedy, d-mass., said that while thomas has never commented publicly on abortion directly, the nominee once praised a speech that called abortion the constitutional equivalent of murder. orrin hatch, r-utah, a strong thomas supporter, said thomas should not be forced to spell out his views on abortion because justice david h. souter, who won senate confirmation last year, was not required to do so. some critics contend thomas holds natural-law views that could lead to the conclusion that fetuses have a right to life requiring states to outlaw all abortions. feminist groups have been in the forefront of the liberal coalition opposing thomas, warning that his vote added to an already conservative supreme court could overturn federal protection for abortion rights and send the issue back to state legislatures. the national abortion rights action league aims to flood senate offices with half a million anti-thomas post cards.
