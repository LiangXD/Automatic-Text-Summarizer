these successes have encouraged the governors of new york, new jersey, washington and missouri to undertake their own reform programs. the most unattractive feature of the governors' welfare plan is its price tag -- up to $2 billion a year on top of the $100 billion-plus already devoted to assorted anti-poverty programs. however committed the administration and congress may be to reform, they're unlikely to endorse a plan that increases the deficit. an extra $2 billion a year added to the present anti-poverty programs (which, as we have mentioned before, if simply handed out in cash would be enough to lift every poor household in america above poverty) is unlikely to accomplish all that the governors promise. all the important players -- the president, the governors and congressional leaders -- agree that the goal of such reform is to transform the welfare system into one that enables poor families to achieve, in the president's words, real and lasting emancipation from welfare dependency. since all of the principals agree on the ultimate goal of welfare reform, it seems reasonable to expect that they can achieve a plan of action. since all of the principals agree on the ultimate goal of welfare reform, it seems reasonable to expect that they can achieve a plan of action.
