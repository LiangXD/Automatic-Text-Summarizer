officials said the capture of osman morote, 43, considered the most radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to date for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the andean highlands in may 1980. there have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry between morote and guzman, and mantilla said he did not discount the possibility that guzman betrayed morote to get him out of the way. there have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry between morote and guzman, and mantilla said he did not discount the possibility that guzman betrayed morote to get him out of the way. the shining path devoted itself to 10 years of semi-clandestine political work with peasants in the impoverished andean highlands before taking up arms. guzman is the ideologist of the organization, but morote is considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military. counterinsurgency sources said morote's capture will create a power vacuum within the central committee of the shining path and spark tension until a replacement is found. since 1980, the movement has expanded from its base in the highland state of ayacucho and now launches attacks throughout much of this impoverished nation.
