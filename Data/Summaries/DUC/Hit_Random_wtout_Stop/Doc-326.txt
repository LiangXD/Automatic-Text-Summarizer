in response to questions about mr. sununu's recent shift to use of corporate jets in the wake of restrictions imposed last month on his use of government planes, the white house released the list of five jets the chief of staff has used for travel to fund-raisers. boyden gray's office approved all the travel in advance, and he vetoed some suggested corporate jets because of potential conflicts of interest, white house officials said. the white house list said that on may 20 mr. sununu used a corporate jet provided by donald bryant, a benefits and insurance executive, to travel to a st. louis fund-raiser for missouri gov. mr. sununu used a jet provided by three individual owners -- identified by the white house as howard bender, martin bender and john mason -- to travel to a chicago fund-raiser june 11. he had taken his white house limousine to reach nearby new york to attend a stamp auction before that event. white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that use of corporate planes for political purposes is a well-established practice that mr. sununu will continue. but mr. bush, who spoke to reporters before a white house meeting as mr. sununu sat nearby, also seemed to suggest that he would like his chief of staff to avoid creating new travel controversies.
