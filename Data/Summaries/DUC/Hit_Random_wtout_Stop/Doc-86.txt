a 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in newark, n.j., has caught the attention of health officials, who had been previously recording with satisfaction a slow, steady decrease in tb cases over the last few decades. they attribute the 5 percent national increase in tb cases in 1989 to the ravages of the aids virus, which destroys the body's immune system and leaves victims open to tb infection, dr. philip c. hopewell of san francisco general hospital said sunday. about 4 percent of americans identified as having the aids virus also have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis, said dr. dixie e. snider jr., director of the division of tuberculosis control at the centers for disease control in atlanta. in wyoming, the centers for disease control recorded no new cases of tb in 1989, demonstrating that it is a condition that can be controlled and cured, according to dr. lee b. reichman, director of the pulmonary division of the university of medicine and dentistry in new jersey. "i have never heard of a rise of the magnitude seen in new jersey or, on the other hand, the hope generated by no cases in one state," reichman said. snider said there has been a 150 percent increased in cases of tb among young blacks in new york city. reichman noted that most american have forgotten about the problems of tb from 1981 to 1984, tb cases declined an average of 6 percent per year according to the centers for disease control.
