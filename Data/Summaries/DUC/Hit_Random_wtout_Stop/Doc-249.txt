officials at the the ljubljanska bank, slovenia's largest bank into which the majority of the foreign exchange accounts were originally deposited, are hoping that the the government of slovenia will guarantee these debts and open up negotiations with the nby for the eventual return of the deposits. slovene officials are also anxious to start negotiations on the unallocated yugoslav federal debt. however, negotiating what share of the unallocated federal debt slovenia should assume is already proving difficult. the unallocated federal debt - which consists of loans to the nby, or the federal government which had not been specifically earmarked for projects in any of the six republics of the former yugoslavia - amounts to dollars 3.5bn. the unallocated federal debt - which consists of loans to the nby, or the federal government which had not been specifically earmarked for projects in any of the six republics of the former yugoslavia - amounts to dollars 3.5bn. mr kranjec says that the bank of slovenia has already proposed negotiations on this issue, as well as trying to discuss the status of the nby's foreign exchange reserves, the clearing balances with the countries of the former cmea socialist trading organisation, and operations of banks. mr kranjec says that the bank of slovenia has already proposed negotiations on this issue, as well as trying to discuss the status of the nby's foreign exchange reserves, the clearing balances with the countries of the former cmea socialist trading organisation, and operations of banks.
