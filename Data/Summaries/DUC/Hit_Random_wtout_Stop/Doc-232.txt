the white house has taken its own polls and remains convinced that president bush's support for nafta is a winning issue. the president is expected to stage a high profile initialing of the agreement at the most politically opportune time. politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like mr harry freeman, executive director of the mtn coalition, believes the democrats will use nafta as a weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to mexico. a centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to the congress in may 1991, in which he committed himself to action on environmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance. it now has 200 signatories to a resolution, introduced by congressman henry waxman and majority leader richard gephardt, which warns that they will not support a nafta that does not have strong environment or food safety provisions. fifty-seven of the 200 signatories voted for the president's fast-track authority and now may be moving over on the issue.
