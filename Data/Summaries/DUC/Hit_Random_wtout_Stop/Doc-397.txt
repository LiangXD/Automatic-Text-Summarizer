a naval commander who had observed the uss vincennes in the persian gulf said the ship had "no good reason" for shooting down an iranian civilian airliner, killing all 290 aboard. carlson, commander of the uss sides, a frigate that was on the scene when the uss vincennes shot down the airbus on july 3, 1988, clearly put the blame on actions taken by the ship and disputed any notion of self-defense. "i fully stand behind the navy report and the performance of my crew." "it's published by the naval institute, a private self-supported non-profit professional society and it's a forum for people to express personal opinions and assertions in various articles related to navy issues, but the naval institute is not part of the u.s. government, so his comments are his own personal opinion," he said. carlson suggests the crew of the vincennes wanted to prove the capability of the ship's aegis missile-defense system in the persian gulf. on the day of the incident, carlson said, a crewman informed him that the vincennes had classified the plane as an iranian f-14 fighter. william m. fogarty, who headed the navy's investigating team, said the captain of the vincennes, will rogers iii, ordered the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken belief the airliner was an iranian f-14 fighter plane.
