when harlow went to mount st. helens in washington state in 1980, geologists were still learning how to read the telltale earthquakes. harlow's team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption is imminent. gradually building earthquakes were followed by the release of gas, the buildup of magma and finally the huge explosions that sent ash clouds more than 75,000 feet into the sky and sent avalanches of hot ash pouring down the narrow valleys west of the volcano. since late tuesday, harlow's colleagues have not been able to get through on the single phone line into the bunker at clark air base, but do not believe the team is in danger. the eruption is on the west side of the mountain, with the summit shielding clark. i'm not so concerned, said pauline lord, harlow's wife. lord said harlow's love affair with volcanoes began when he was an undergraduate student at dartmouth college and his professor took the entire class to observe an eruption in guatemala.
