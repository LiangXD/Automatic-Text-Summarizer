the researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's production of interferon, a disease-fighting substance, may play a role in warding off the development of cancer. the researchers, based at the university of chicago, found an association between loss of the genes and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood leukemia. they tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes. some genes, known oncogenes, are though to trigger cancer. cancer can also occur when other genes, known as anti-oncogenes, are missing. the production of two forms of interferon, known as alpha and beta-1, are controlled by two genes that are close together on chromosome 9 in the body's library of genes. in the latest work, the researchers found that this section of the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
