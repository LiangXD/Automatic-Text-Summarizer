the same situation applies if your boss has a polygraph examiner come into the warehouse tomorrow to hook wires to randomly selected employees and question them about merchandise missing from the company's shelves. "we expect that the new law will ban 80 percent of the approximately 2 million polygraph tests given annually," goldberg said in a prepared statement. the only other private-sector exceptions to the general ban apply to companies that manufacture, distribute or dispense controlled substances and some types of firms in the security guard, armored car or security alarm fields. "now employees can complain to the department of labor or go into court to protect themselves against these inaccurate gadgets," goldberg said. she said the law would have the greatest impact in alabama, arizona, arkansas, colorado, florida, georgia, illinois, indiana, kansas, kentucky, louisiana, mississippi, missouri, nevada, new hampshire, new mexico, new york, north carolina, north dakota, ohio, oklahoma, south carolina, south dakota, tennessee, texas, utah, virginia and wyoming. goldberg said employers in the following states, which allow businesses to request people to take lie detector tests, could be affected by the new law: california, hawaii, idaho, maryland, montana, nebraska, pennsylvania and wisconsin. goldberg said employers in the following states, which allow businesses to request people to take lie detector tests, could be affected by the new law: california, hawaii, idaho, maryland, montana, nebraska, pennsylvania and wisconsin.
