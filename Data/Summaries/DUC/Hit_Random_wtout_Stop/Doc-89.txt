experts say the problem is not the same as sick building syndrome -- a situation in which workers are exposed chronically to toxic chemicals and gases emitted from carpets, furniture and other building materials. but as in sick building syndrome, it's the airtight environment that sets the stage for problems. the study found that 40 percent of the building's workers -- or 27 of 47 -- were infected with tuberculosis from one 30-year-old sick employee. people who had no direct contact with this case, might have been exposed in far reaches of the building. people who had no direct contact with this case, might have been exposed in far reaches of the building. the building's ventilation system permitted circulation of some outdoor air -- 15 cubic feet per minute -- a low level commonly found in buildings since the 1930s. in the study, nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis.
