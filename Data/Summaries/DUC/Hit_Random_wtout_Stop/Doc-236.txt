with dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassroots organisations have succeed in fanning anti-nafta sentiment into widespread public hostility against the pact with canada and mexico. the continued economic sluggishness and the drumbeat of corporate layoff announcements have hurt the pact's chances and presented the administration with a formidable challenge. pro-nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting the opposition's success in framing the debate against nafta as a pact which would cost jobs. to keep the pro-nafta case before the public, president clinton wednesday took off for new orleans and top officials in his administration fanned out on speaking tours across the country. government agencies have been mobilised for the battle, given pro-nafta literature and instructed to boost the pact in seminars and public forums. a greenpeace release warned that two decades of work on environmental protection would be undermined if the pact is approved. in response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental, citizen and labour groups, vice president al gore, senator max baucus and other lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the largest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental side pact, held a briefing to praise nafta's environmental safeguards.
