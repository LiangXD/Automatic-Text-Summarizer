these days, sununu seems to be making a habit of going the wrong way: the latest flap is over his taking a chauffeur-driven white house car to new york to attend a stamp auction. sununu's latest problems stem from his use of his official car to go to new york for a stamp auction. there was nothing illegal about the trip, or sununu's ride home on a corporate jet after attending a gop fund-raiser in new jersey later that night. i recognize, and i think the governor (sununu) does, there's an appearance problem, said bush, who nonetheless defended sununu's use of the car as permissible in this case and said sununu's job was safe. the controversy is unquestionably an embarrassment for bush, who has prided himself on setting a high ethical standard for his administration. but critics complain that sununu's brusque style has alienated republicans and democrats needlessly, causing unnecessary ill will. but critics complain that sununu's brusque style has alienated republicans and democrats needlessly, causing unnecessary ill will.
