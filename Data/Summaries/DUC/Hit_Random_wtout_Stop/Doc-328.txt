washington -- embattled white house chief of staff john sununu, fighting for his political survival, has a rare bit of good news: while americans generally don't approve of his actions, most don't think he should resign. though president bush says mr. sununu's job is safe for now, the ruckus over the chief of staff's extensive use of government and corporate jets and cars has brought to the surface a host of sununu enemies who are likely to keep gunning for his demise. they canvassed 1,006 registered voters by telephone from last saturday through tuesday, a period when the latest flap over mr. sununu's failure to inform the white house counsel's office accurately about the procurement of a corporate jet he used to attend a chicago fund-raiser was in full swing. mr. sununu admitted that he made mistakes in using government planes and his white house car for personal and political business, and he has adopted a low profile. enemies of the combative mr. sununu are trying to capitalize on his weakened position to hurt him, largely through anonymous criticisms and attacks. some administration aides and republican strategists are arguing, for instance, that he now is a clear political liability and should be pushed aside before mr. bush's re-election campaign gets into full swing. there also is quiet lobbying against mr. sununu by israel's supporters, who long have been suspicious of him because of his links to arab-american groups and his refusal as governor of new hampshire to endorse a proclamation condemning a united nations vote equating zionism with racism.
