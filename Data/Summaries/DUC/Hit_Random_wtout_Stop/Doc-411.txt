the cruise ship song of america was forced to return to port after an engine seized up and started a small fire, but no one was hurt, the ship's owner said today. on tuesday, a few hours out of cozumel, mexico, one of its four engines seized up, touching off a fire in the engine room, said royal caribbean cruise line spokesman rich steck. "any time you have a fire it's a big deal, but it was quickly brought under control," steck said. the passengers were mustered on deck while crew members doused the blaze, but then allowed to resume the evening's activities, he said. the 705-foot ship turned around and returned to cozumel on its remaining three engines to replenish firefighting supplies, steck said. passengers stayed aboard, and the song of america will return to miami on thursday or friday. all passengers will be offered early flights home, along with full refunds or the chance to book another cruise, steck said.
