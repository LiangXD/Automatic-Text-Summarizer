juba, southern sudan's largest city, is 60 miles southwest of the quake's reported epicenter. scientists said the quake's epicenter was 700 miles south of sudan's capital, khartoum. a crew with koepp's organization landed in the region with relief supplies two hours after the quake struck at 4:22 a.m. and reported seeing nothing amiss. egypt's two principal earthquake monitoring stations, including one at the aswan high dam, 600 miles south of cairo and just north of the sudan border, recorded the quake at 7.5 on the richter scale. "it's such a big quake that the monitoring stations are saturated with data," said geologist rashad m. kebeasy, president of egypt's national research institute of astronomy and geophysics.
