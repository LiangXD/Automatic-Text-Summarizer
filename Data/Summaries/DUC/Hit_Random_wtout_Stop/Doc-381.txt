under new regulations issued friday by the labor department, employers can be fined up to $10,000 for requiring a job seeker or employee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph exam for voice stress analysis. some 7.2 million employers nationwide will be required to put up posters in december summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions and outlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detector test. in addition to the fines, anyone required to take the test in violation of the new law can sue employers in federal and state courts for relief, such as employment reinstatement, promotion and any payment of lost wages and benefits. exempted from protection under the ban are employees of federal, state and local governments or of federal contractors engaged in national security, intelligence or top secret activities. but any workers asked to submit to a polygraph exam under those conditions must be given at least 48 hours advance notice and a statement in advance telling them of their rights, including the right to refuse the test or to terminate it at any time. the pre-test statement also must explain the specific incident or activity being investigated and the basis for the employer's suspicion that the person asked to take the exam was involved in it. results of a polygraph test or refusal to submit to such an exam cannot be used alone as a basis for taking any action against an employee.
