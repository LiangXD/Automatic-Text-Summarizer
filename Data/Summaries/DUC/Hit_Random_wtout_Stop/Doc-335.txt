victor boyarsky of the soviet arctic and antarctic research institute, a popular explorer and veteran of polar travel, is a co-leader. the other members of the team are glaciologist qin dahe of china geoff somers, who has spent 42 months in antarctica with the british antarctic survey and keizo funatsu of japan, a former economist who turned to dog-sledding and adventure. "we want the world to know much, much more about antarctica after our expedition than it did before we set out," steger said. a treaty signed in 1959 by a dozen nations, with additional signatories in subsequent years, put all territorial claims on antarctica on hold, banned military activity and established freedom of scientific inquiry. these ominous changes are most apparent in antarctica, making it "like a canary in a mine," steger said. qin will take snow and ice samples all the way across antarctica, recording temperatures and oxygen content for a geological history of the icecap. qin will take snow and ice samples all the way across antarctica, recording temperatures and oxygen content for a geological history of the icecap.
