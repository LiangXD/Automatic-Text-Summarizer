a top west german military official said saturday that the fiery crash of a u.s. air force jet that killed six people will further erode popular support for national defense programs. a u.s. air force a-10 thunderbolt ii jet tore a swath of destruction through a working-class neighborhood in the central west german city of remscheid. even before thursday's fatal crash, 12 major accidents of military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone. they included 70 people who died as a result of an air show crash at the u.s. base in ramstein in august. the u.s. air force said in a statement saturday that the pilot of the a-10 "inadvertently flew into clouds" while attempting to join in close formation with another aircraft. the air force statement, quoting maj. gen. marcus a. anderson, said the pilot "then initiated a separation maneuver as is normal if two aircraft in formation lose visual contact."
