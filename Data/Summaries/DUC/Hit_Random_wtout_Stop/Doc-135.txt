since then, however, swai has won two races, the coronado half marathon in july, which he finished in 1:04.50, and the goodwill games 10-kilometer run last month in seattle. he insists he'll need that kind of a time to beat a bevy of mexican and african runners. the runners swai fears most include: carlos ayala of mexico city, who finished fourth in this year's grandma's marathon jose luis chuela of mexico, who was second in this race in 1988 (1:03:42) sam sitonik of kenya, who placed fourth in the 1987 america's finest city half marathon at 1:06:01 and sammy rotich, a kenyan who ran a personal best 1:01:55 in 1987. jones, 32, finished the 1989 new york city marathon second to ingrid kristiansen of norway with a personal-best time of 2:27.54. she will be challenged by janine aiello of toas, n.m., who placed second in this year's san francisco marathon lynn deninnof of st. louis, who won a gold medal in the 10 kilometer at the 1990 tac championships and kathryn evans of fort collins, colo., winner of the 1990 nebraska half marathon. the course is considered by runners to be a difficult one -- so difficult, in fact, that most elite runners who train in san diego stay away from the race. the runner who is smart and thinks through it will be the one who is going to win.
