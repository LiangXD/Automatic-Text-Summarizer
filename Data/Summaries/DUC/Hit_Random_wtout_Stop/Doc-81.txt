drug abusers who are infected with the aids virus and tuberculosis bacteria should be treated with medicine to prevent full-blown tb, says a study published today. doctors have noticed a growing prevalence of tuberculosis in recent years among people at high risk of aids, especially drug addicts. "the aggressive identification and treatment of hiv-infected intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is therefore of both clinical and public health importance," wrote dr. peter a. selwyn of montefiore medical center in new york. the study was conducted on 520 drug users who were in a methadone program. during almost two years of followup, active tuberculosis developed in eight of the aids-infected people, but in none of those who did not have hiv. the doctors noted that 13 people who carried hiv and tb bacteria were treated with the drug isoniazid, and none of them went on to get active tuberculosis. the doctors said that the drug is now administered along with daily methadone doses at the clinic where the study was conducted.
