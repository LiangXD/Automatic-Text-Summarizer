american officials staunchly disavow any interest in driving through iraq toward baghdad, either in pursuit of saddam hussein himself or to set up some american-controlled government inside iraq. american war planners have long assumed that the early stage of the ground attack, in which american forces would use their speed to sweep around iraqi defenses and their strength to punch through the relatively weak iraqi front line, would be the easiest part. american war planners have long assumed that the early stage of the ground attack, in which american forces would use their speed to sweep around iraqi defenses and their strength to punch through the relatively weak iraqi front line, would be the easiest part. and robert gates, mr. bush's deputy national security adviser, asserted in an interview on the cable news network that iraqi troops have set fire to large sections of kuwait city. he argued setting an explicit deadline for saddam hussein to break would, when it was broken, give the u.s. military a clear green light to proceed. in setting out his final challenge to saddam hussein, mr. bush continued the intensive personal diplomacy he began after the invasion last august. and when he and president gorbachev spoke about the decision in a talk lasting nearly an hour, the president took pains to listen to what his counterpart had to say, although he already had decided that the soviet alternative to the allied deadline was unacceptable.
