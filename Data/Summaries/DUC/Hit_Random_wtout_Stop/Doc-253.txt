president reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and agriculture secretary richard lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government's conservation reserve program. shrinking soybean stockpiles and soaring prices have stirred speculation that the government may impose an embargo on exports of soybeans and soybean products. realtors in rural areas say that land prices, which had just begun to turn around, may be affected. in april, the price of good-quality iowa farm land was one-third higher than it was a year earlier. because of the drought, iowa realtors expect land prices to rise somewhat less than the 5% to 10% they had been expecting. he is hoping that drought damage and rising crop prices will fan inflationary fears so high that land again will be a hot commodity. the department said it won't allow livestock-grazing on land in the soil-conservation program, under which farmers are paid to take erodible acreage out of crop production.
