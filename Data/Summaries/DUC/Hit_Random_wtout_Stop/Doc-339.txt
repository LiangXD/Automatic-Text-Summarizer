the united states risks losing an unusual opportunity to assert global leadership in protecting antarctica, sen. albert gore (d-tenn.) said thursday on the eve of an international conference on the future of the frozen continent. it is calling on the united states and other nations participating in the conference, which begins monday in chile, to designate antarctica as a world science park. bruce vento (d-minn.), chairman of the house interior subcommittee on parks and public land, said he fears that recurring degradation has made antarctica an environmental time bomb ready to explode. the legislation for the first time would apply u.s. environmental protection laws to any activity in antarctica sponsored by an agency of the u.s. government. french oceanologist jacques cousteau, in an interview with the new york times last year, declared that an oil spill in the antarctic could damage the food chain for decades and affect the entire hemisphere. n. andersen, the national science foundation's deputy general counsel.
