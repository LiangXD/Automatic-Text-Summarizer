damage caused by hurricane andrew could rise to dollars 20bn, it was estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest us storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of new orleans. new orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable because the city lies below sea level, has the mississippi river running through its centre and a large lake immediately to the north. the brunt of insurance claims from the florida storm will fall on the us industry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the state farm group and the allstate insurance unit of sears roebuck. these are also the leading property/casualty and home insurance groups in louisiana, together with american international group. a spokesman for state farm insurance said he believed the company had roughly 20 per cent of the florida market. according to balcombe group, a uk-based claims adjustment firm, other insurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are hartford insurance, aetna and travellers. about 12 per cent of travellers' home insurance premium income came from florida last year, and 4.6 per cent of its commercial insurance premiums.
