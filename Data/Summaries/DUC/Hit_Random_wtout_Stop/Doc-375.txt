<p> far beneath this modern metropolis, the powerful forces of nature are locked in a slow but deadly battle that will some day bring this great city to its knees. </p> <p> already overcrowded and growing at a staggering rate, tokyo sits on a deep sedimentary basin that is like a bowl of jello cradled by one of the most treacherous geological formations on the planet. two of the plates sink beneath the islands of japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the earth directly below tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. </p> <p> most other earthquake-prone regions, including california, only have to worry about two colliding plates. </p> <p> the threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is being reclaimed from tokyo bay to serve the needs of millions more who are flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity. okada directs a research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. </p> <p> okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations beneath japan are constantly active. </p> <p> the earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the planet. shock waves striking the bedrock are reflected back up toward the surface, extending the life of the earthquake. </p> <p> the duration of the shaking is very long, said oyagi, of the national research center for disaster prevention. </p> <p> officials here know those conditions could add up to disaster for tokyo, a belief that was reinforced by kyoto university's iemura when he returned from his tour of the san francisco bay area after the oct. is that also a special case? </p> <p> although he thinks the question needs more study, iemura is troubled by the fact that much of tokyo is built on areas similar to san francisco's marina district. </p> <p> and like san francisco, tokyo is extremely short of land on which to build the high rises needed to house the millions who continue to flock to this crowded city. </p> <p> the answer to the land shortage, japanese authorities have concluded, is to reclaim more land from tokyo bay -- a prospect that deeply troubles many experts. is that also a special case? </p> <p> although he thinks the question needs more study, iemura is troubled by the fact that much of tokyo is built on areas similar to san francisco's marina district. </p> <p> and like san francisco, tokyo is extremely short of land on which to build the high rises needed to house the millions who continue to flock to this crowded city. </p> <p> the answer to the land shortage, japanese authorities have concluded, is to reclaim more land from tokyo bay -- a prospect that deeply troubles many experts. the pacific and the philippine sea plates are being forced under the eurasia plate, and the two subducting plates collide directly beneath tokyo. </p> <p> that dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed tokyo in 1923, as well as about 1,000 smaller quakes every month. </p>
