by promising radical welfare reform, mr clinton was sending a powerful subliminal message: he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban society. this gives poor working families a cash bonus of up to dollars 2,500 a year, increasing the incentive to take low paid jobs. in addition, the administration promises to bolster the economic position of welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to support their children financially. the objection is not that some families in straitened circumstances need afdc as a short-term prop, but that half of those on welfare behave as though they have a meal ticket for life. with its economic life support system (welfare) ripped away, the underclass will shrivel. but it would involve a huge expansion of public sector employment and cost perhaps dollars 50-60bn a year, far more than the clinton administration is willing to spend on welfare reform. mr clinton could tighten the definition of 'employable', so as to include mothers with children under the age of three, and set more demanding workfare participation targets, for example that 50 per cent of welfare recipients should be working or in training by the year 2000.
