in the late 1970s, poor farmers living in communities surrounding this small town began replacing their fields of cacao and coffee with coca to meet the growing u.s. demand for cocaine. while washington has been quick to trumpet links between guerrillas and drug trafficking in other countries, u.s. officials downplay the connection between drugs and the shining path. and this is something peruvian and u.s. officials apparently would rather avoid. the army continued its raids against the shining path in one part of the valley, but the drug growers were increasing production in several other parts while anti-drug officials were virtually kept under lock and key. the army continued its raids against the shining path in one part of the valley, but the drug growers were increasing production in several other parts while anti-drug officials were virtually kept under lock and key. anti-drug police, upper huallaga residents and interior ministry officials report that army officers received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs from drug lords for their help in keeping anti-drug officials at bay. this is the catch-22 that now confounds peruvian and u.s. officials trying to eradicate both drugs and guerrillas from peru. --- mr. bridges is a free-lance writer.
