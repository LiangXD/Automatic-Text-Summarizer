urgent legislative meeting slovenia's parliament was called into emergency session after a 12-point list of demands from the army was presented to republic leaders, insisting that all impediments to federal army operations be removed as part of a western-brokered cease-fire. the slovenian government charged the army with repeated breaches of the cease-fire and demanded the surrender of army units and installations that slovenian forces had surrounded and cut off since the fighting began thursday. at the end of the day, the maneuvering by all three republics ensured a prolongation of the crisis that has deprived the country of a civilian commander in chief for more than six weeks and effectively left the army to make its own moves. casualties mount at least 40 people were killed in the first two days of fighting in slovenia, including 20 federal army soldiers, four slovenian fighters and 12 civilians, said janez jansa, the slovenian defense minister. ljubljana, the slovenian capital, was an armed camp, where armed civilians and territorial guards stopped people at random and demanded identification cards. croatian president franjo tudjman said his republic was not hoping for a fight but was ready if need be. the crisis evoked further expressions of anguish from foreign leaders, and for the first time a high-placed u.s. official hinted that the administration may be weighing the possibility of recognizing croatia and slovenia.
