house passage of a plan to raise the minimum wage shifts the partisan battle to the senate, where the leading proponent of an increase is urging president bush to refrain from further veto threats while congress settles on a final bill. high on the senate agenda when it returns is a bill sponsored by sen. kennedy has said he is open to amending his bill, and in a statement issued after the house vote he asked bush, who has threatened to veto any attempt to raise the hourly minimum above $4.25, to keep an open mind until the house and senate agree on a bill. sponsors of the house bill, while disputing gop projections of massive job losses, added a provision allowing a sub-minimum wage to be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job. as amended, the house bill would boost the minimum wage to $3.85 an hour on oct. current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less than $362,000 from the minimum-wage law the house bill increased that level to $500,000. the provision is rarely used, however, because of confusing regulations lawmakers say will be simplified in conference committee if the senate passes a minimum-wage bill.
