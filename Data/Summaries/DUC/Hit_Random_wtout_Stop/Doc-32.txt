block's measured response to the criticism -- and the lack of a riveting videotape -- have spared him the level of heat felt by police chief daryl gates. joseph mcnamara, retired chief of san jose's department and now a fellow at stanford university's hoover institution, said he has been getting calls all summer from cities around the country about racism and brutality in their departments. the city council is reviewing the recommendations, some of which -- for instance, a term limit for the chief -- require voter approval. block pointed to social ills including high drop-out and illiteracy rates, young people who are raising themselves, and a county jail system that is perhaps the major houser of mentally ill people in our society in this nation. agreeing that law enforcement is not the answer to all of society's failures, critics say block is missing the point. besides a new police chief, the aclu's hicks predicted only some window dressing and some moderate changes made to training. on the county side, critics say block's position as an elected official insulates him from the kind of independent review the city was able to order for the police department.
