<p> public officials throughout california have condemned a u.s. senate vote thursday to exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 census, saying the action will shortchange california in congress and possibly deprive the state of millions of dollars of federal aid for medical emergency services and other programs for poor people. </p> <p> i think it's an outrageous piece of legislation and probably unconstitutional, assemblyman peter chacon said friday. with an estimated population of about 28 million people, california is thought to have at least 50% of the nation's 3 million to 8 million illegal aliens. </p> <p> authorities on reapportionment have widely predicted that california would gain five to seven congressional seats as a result of population gains made during the last decade. milton marks, a san francisco democrat who chairs the senate's elections and reapportionment committee. </p> <p> </p> <p> loss of funds feared </p> <p> jesse r. huff, the state's financial director, said the state could lose as much as $300 million in federal aid that is allocated on the basis of population as determined by census counts. </p> <p> los angeles county officials said the measure could cut off federal funds for emergency medical services for illegal aliens. in the past, about $80 million annually in such services for illegal aliens has been paid out, with about half of that amount paid in los angeles county, according to mark tajima, a legislative analyst employed by the county's chief administrative officer. </p> <p> los angeles city atty. hahn's office said the city could lose at least $20 million in federal aid over the next 10 years -- money that goes for child care, housing rehabilitation, drug counseling and services for homeless people. </p> <p> </p> <p> immigration law overhaul </p> <p> the measure passed by the senate was part of a larger overhaul of the nation's immigration laws that, if it becomes law, would place an annual cap of 630,000 immigrants for each of the next three years and make room for more residents of western europe. </p> <p> the senate bill is expected to face tough opposition in the house, where states such as california, new york and illinois with large alien populations have many votes. moreover, a federal court in pittsburgh ruled earlier this year that excluding illegal aliens from the census would be unconstitutional. </p> <p> but even if the senate's action were to become law, it is not clear how much impact it would have on federal aid. </p> <p> i think the effect is going to be minimal, said michael myers, counsel to the house subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs. they all involve direct payments by the county of federal money, he said. </p> <p> in orange county, with the second-largest illegal alien population in the state, officials warned that any effort by the census bureau to identify illegals would promote fear and intimidation among recent immigrants, both legal and illegal.
