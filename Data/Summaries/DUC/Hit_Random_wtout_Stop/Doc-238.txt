the fight over the north american free trade agreement yesterday shifted outside washington to the congressional districts of members, sampling public opinion at home during this veterans' day holiday weekend. arthur andersen &amp company yesterday released a survey, by its tax and business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives of medium-sized companies in canada, mexico and the us strongly support nafta. mr perot claimed mexicans were treated worse than animals and livestock in the us, were oppressed by the government, and enjoyed few if any labour and democratic rights. the mexican congress issued a statement, supported by most political parties, which said: 'we cannot ignore however, that certain judgments expressed, apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country, attack and offend mexicans. 'the only thing that matters is the economy,' said mr christopher whalen, a washington trade consultant. trying to blunt any momentum for the administration, congressman david bonior, an anti-nafta whip, on wednesday announced that he had 219 of 434 members pledged to vote against the pact. washington will not be bereft of activity over the long weekend.
