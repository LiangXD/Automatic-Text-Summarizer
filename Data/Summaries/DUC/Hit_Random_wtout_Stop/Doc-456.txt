mr chris patten, hong kong's governor, yesterday gave china until the end of the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of hong kong. after more than six hours of discussions with lu ping, director of the chinese cabinet's office of hong kong and macao affairs, mr patten said: 'i cannot say we reached a meeting of minds on what i put forward.' mr patten said that they had agreed the best forum for settlement was the airport committee of the anglo-chinese joint liaison group - a place where consensus has been stalled for months. mr patten said that he was prepared to meet lu 'at any time and in any place' to reach agreement but had reminded the chinese they had only until the end of the year. although mr patten did not say so yesterday, he has suggested in the past that he would be prepared to introduce his proposals for a slightly faster pace of democratic development in hong kong without china's approval. mr patten would give only few details of lu's response to his proposals. mr patten's defeat in the british parliamentary election earlier this year has been used to suggest he is a failed politician.
