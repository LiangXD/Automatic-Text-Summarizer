mr. brock said in an interview that exemptions from the minimum wage would be necessary for youths who lack entry-level job skills and for small businesses. but the administration will remain opposed to any broad minimum-wage boost that results in massive disemployment of young people, he added. he said boosting the level would worsen problems that many poorly educated, unskilled youths face in trying to find work in a more complex job market. i don't want to take a chance that we add to that problem by boosting the minimum wage and thereby pricing young people out of the job market. the administration has long supported a subminimum wage for youths, along with stressing the need for job-training and education programs. most house labor committee members oppose any youth subminimum wage, the small-business exemption has foundered in the past, and wage-indexing must stay in the bill, a staff official for the panel said. one congressional staffer concluded: apparently he's making some progress within the reagan administration.
