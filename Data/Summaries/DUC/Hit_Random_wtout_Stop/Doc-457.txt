the sharp deterioration in relations between britain and china over hong kong's political future has cast a pall over the colony's financial markets. on friday, lu ping, china's top official on hong kong affairs, said beijing would challenge the validity of future elections and abrogate agreements to build the colony's multi-billion dollar airport if mr patten proceeded without china's agreement. the airport and its associated infrastructure projects have been a running sore in anglo-chinese relations since the project was announced, in the aftermath of the june 1989 uprising in beijing, as a confidence boosting measure for the colony. in a robust performance before a special session of the legislative council (legco) on saturday, mr patten reissued his challenge to beijing to respond with constructive alternatives to proposals he made on october 7 for the colony's political development. the government is bracing itself for a further onslaught on mr patten's plans from the colony's pro-beijing press. according to aides, the governor believes he can carry the legislature in the event of failure to find agreement with china, they promise a publicity campaign of the sort which prepared the colony for his policy speech. according to aides, the governor believes he can carry the legislature in the event of failure to find agreement with china, they promise a publicity campaign of the sort which prepared the colony for his policy speech.
