johnson testified this week at a canadian inquiry that his seven-year involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections before the 1987 world championships in rome, where he set the existing world record of 9.83 seconds. i would have to see the evidence, but if he was on drugs at the time of the world championships, my thought would be to remove his record, said ollan cassell, executive director of the athletics congress, the national governing board for the sport. the possibility that johnson could lose his record was raised when the iaaf asked for an urgent legal opinion to see what it could do about records and championships of confessed drug users. the... actions would allow the iaaf, if it so decided, retroactively to withdraw results obtained and any records achieved by such athletes, the statement said. there was much discussion among athletes competing this week in the tac championships about whether johnson should be allowed back into the sport after he completes his two-year suspension. i even heard him speaking out against drugs and that's the important thing. al joyner, the 1984 olympic gold medalist in the triple jump, said johnson should be allowed to compete again, only because that is the rule.
