to justify seizing lincoln savings &amp loan assn., regulators arbitrarily wrote down the value of its $1.4-billion loan portfolio as 50% less and slashed the worth of its extensive land, hotel and stock holdings by 75%, the thrift's former owner said wednesday. the document estimated that the thrift's assets were worth only $2 billion to $2.5 billion, or $1.85 billion to $2.2 billion less than what they were listed on lincoln's books at the time. james murphy, an attorney representing the treasury department's office of thrift supervision, repeatedly objected to keating comparing the numbers from the regulators' april 21 analysis and keating's own figures on the status of lincoln's loans and equity holdings as of dec. this is not by any stretch of the imagination the last word on the implementation of the receivership four months later, murphy said. the office of thrift supervision succeeded the federal home loan bank board as the industry's chief regulator under the $50-billion savings and loan bailout passed last year by congress. u.s. district judge stanley sporkin overruled murphy's objections, but said he wanted testimony from keating's chief financial officer in addition to hearing from regulators on their justifications for the writedowns. you don't write down 50% on a mortgage portfolio, said sporkin, who is a former accountant and was at one time the chief enforcement officer for the securities and exchange commission.
