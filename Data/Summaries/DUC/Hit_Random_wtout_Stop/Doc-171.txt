exxon officials monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of alaskan coastline fouled by the nation's largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a suspension of local environmental laws. the worst areas _ three miles of sludge-covered beaches on several small islands _ would be targeted immediately, with the others scheduled for gradual cleansing through sept. 15. exxon's plan calls for the recovered waste to be strained for usable oil that can be refined, and said the oil-laced wastewater could be treated at the alyeska pipeline service co.'s disposal plant in valdez. meanwhile, tar and sludge from the valdez spill fouled the beaches of alaska's wild katmai national park, drenching hundreds of sea otters and birds and threatening the huge brown bears prowling the refuge. we have seen several hundred sea otters swimming in oil. exxon is feeling the effects of the spill far beyond alaska waters. exxon also received sharp criticism from the federal government, which accused the company of "foot-dragging" in the construction of a second facility in seward to aid in the cleanup of sea otters fouled by the oil.
