this week's flare-up of western wildfires can't hold a candle to the damage wrought by last year's record-breaking fire season, but officials say a dry august could change everything. "right now, the fire season is just starting to gear up," said sandi sacher, spokeswoman at the federal government's wildfire command post in boise, idaho. one of the hardest-hit areas was yellowstone national park, where fire blackened about 1 million acres, nearly half the park's territory. by year's end, 6 million acres had burned in the west and alaska, making 1988 the worst fire season in 30 years, and, in terms of firefighting resources committed, the most expensive in u.s. history, sacher said. the widespread drought of 1988 has been replaced by spotty rain and local areas of dry weather, sacher said. fire danger is high this week in parts of oregon, nevada and idaho, the national weather service said monday. "they're keeping a very close eye on the weatt, dry weather with lightning strikes, that could be serious."
