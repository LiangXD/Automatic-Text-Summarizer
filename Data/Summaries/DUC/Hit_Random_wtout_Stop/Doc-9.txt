new cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of creutzfeld-jacob disease, a brain disorder similar to bse. richard lacey, a microbiology professor at leeds university and the leading critic of government policy on bse, said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance. he believes that bse can trigger human brain disease. robert will of edinburgh's western general hospital, who has been monitoring cjd in the uk since 1990 on behalf of the health department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with bse-affected herds. meanwhile, cattle are succumbing to bse at a rate of about one per 100 every year. scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem: bse, scrapie and cjd are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which does not follow the normal rules of microbiology. most independent experts maintain that no human being - dairy farmer or beef eater - is likely to be exposed to bse in sufficient quantities to develop brain disease.
