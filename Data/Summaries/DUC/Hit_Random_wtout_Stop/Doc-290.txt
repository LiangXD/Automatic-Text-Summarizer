a 1988 report by the u.s. geological survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the southern santa cruz mountains. he noted that the 1988 report, titled "probabilities of large earthquakes occurring in california on the san andreas fault," presented information that was already widely known among scientists. frank baldwin of u.s. geological survey's earthquake center said the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the richter scale. it was centered in the santa cruz, calif., area, 75 miles south of san francico. the damage in the bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the 1987 whittier quake in the los angeles area, which registered a 5.9 richter reading, allen said. allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in san francisco also exist in the los angeles region. the highest, the usgs says, is in the central california town of parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.
