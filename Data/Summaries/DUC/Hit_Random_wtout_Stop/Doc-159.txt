ben johnson knowingly took steroids and those close close to the runner also were aware of it, fellow canadian olympic sprinter angella issajenko was quoted as saying in an interview published sunday. johnson _ stripped of his olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final after he tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol _ also was taking steroids when he set a world sprint record last summer in rome, the toronto star newspaper quoted ms. issajenko as saying. ms. issajenko, who also competed in the olympics in seoul, south korea, was quoted as saying she also took the muscle-building drug. "i just don't care any more," ms. issajenko was quoted as saying. johnson, 26, says he has never knowingly taken illegal drugs while astaphan has said he has never administered stanozolol _ the banned steroid found in the runner's urine sample after his world record 100-meter run at the olympics. ms. issajenko, 30, was quoted as saying she had first-hand knowledge johnson received steroids from astaphan from 1984 to 1986 but "ben was going on his own to jamie after that." johnson's seoul run lowered that mark to 9.79 seconds.
