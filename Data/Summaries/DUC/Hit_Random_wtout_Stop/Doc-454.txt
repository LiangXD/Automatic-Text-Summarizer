most of the deaths occurred when houses and other buildings collapsed under the weight of as much as eight inches of ash and sand spewed from the rumbling crater. as many as 150,000 people fleeing the volcano were said to be crowding into evacuation centers monday night in manila, the capital, about 50 miles south of the volcano. it's about time we left, said lisa hedland, wife of an air force sergeant, as she prepared to board the cruiser long beach with her 15-month-old daughter. we have nothing except the clothes we are wearing, said solidad santiago, a 41-year-old laundry worker from angeles, who fled to a manila evacuation center sunday with most but not all of her family. our house collapsed because of the volcano, said santiago, a widow, whose face showed signs of the wrenching fear of the past week. we have lost everything, but still i am happy, happy to be here, said romayo garcia, a 29-year-old mason, whose house near the now-evacuated clark air base, about 10 miles east of mount pinatubo, had collapsed from the weight of volcanic ash. garcia said he and several members of his family trudged nearly 20 miles through ankle-deep ash until they found a truck driver willing to take them to manila.
