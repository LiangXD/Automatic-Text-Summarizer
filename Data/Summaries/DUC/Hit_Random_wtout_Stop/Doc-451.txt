scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the mount unzen volcano in japan, he said. until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well. but winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash directly toward the base. the scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. the scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside. but it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base. but it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base.
