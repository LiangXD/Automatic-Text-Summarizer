hurricane andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in us history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of new orleans. the storm, which brought havoc to southern florida on monday and then headed north-west across the gulf of mexico, had made landfall late on tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural cajun country. although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in florida on monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. in louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city, franklin and new iberia. associated tornadoes devastated laplace, 20 miles west of new orleans. the storm caused little damage to louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. hurricane hugo, which devastated much of south carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some dollars 4.2bn.
