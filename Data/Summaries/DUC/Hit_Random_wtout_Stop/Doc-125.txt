a colleague says that if liberals interpreted the second amendment the way they interpret the rest of the bill of rights, there would be law professors arguing that gun ownership is mandatory. kates expends most energy demonstrating that at the time of the bill of rights, all able-bodied men were considered to be part of the militia and were expected to defend the state if necessary. the phrase right of the people appears four other times in the bill of rights (including the first amendment). kates also marshals impressive historical evidence that the second amendment, like other bill of rights protections, was intended to incorporate english common law rights of the time, which pretty clearly included the right to keep a gun in your home for reasons having nothing to do with the militia. it would be remarkable indeed if none of the bill of rights became less sensible and more burdensome with time. it would be remarkable indeed if none of the bill of rights became less sensible and more burdensome with time. it would be remarkable indeed if none of the bill of rights became less sensible and more burdensome with time.
