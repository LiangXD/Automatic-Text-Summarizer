a recommended halt to the government's "let it burn" forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the western fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium. the panel, in recommendations thursday to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits to allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn. "my guess is that the moratorium would be finished by the beginning of the western fire season, which is the middle of may," charles philpot, co-chairman of the review panel, told a news conference. the panel was assembled last september after the worst fire season ever in drought-primed yellowstone national park. the report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened. plans should consider the effects of prolonged drought, fuel moisture content and the possibility that multiple fires will tie up fire-fighting resources, the report said. another recommendation called for the responsible agency official to "certify in writing daily that adequate resources are available to ensure" that every natural fire will be kept within boundaries set by government authorities.
