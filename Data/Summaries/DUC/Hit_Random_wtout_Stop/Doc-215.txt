prolonged drought, bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and killing brush and trees that surround many southern california neighborhoods, creating the potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades, fire officials warned monday. the last really good rainfall was back in '82-83, so our brush really hasn't recuperated in seven years, said gordon rowley, a fire management specialist with the u.s. forest service. in foothill districts closer to los angeles, a fungus that preys upon drought-weakened brush has killed as much as 60% of the chaparral in some portions of the santa monica and san gabriel mountains. and because of the drought, even the live brush is more incendiary than usual, officials said. scott franklin, a vegetation management officer with the county fire department, said the dead trees and dry brush combine to form a fuel source so volatile that any ignition now could become a major fire. fire stress areas map shows largely undeveloped land where dead brush and a lack of leaf moisture in live brush create high fire hazards. what you can do fire officials have a number of recommendations for residents of areas where the wildfire danger is high: clear brush and grass a minimum of 30 feet away from any buildings.
