the 14-deck, 800-foot luxury liner left miami on saturday for a seven-day voyage to la badee, a private island near haiti puerto rico and st. thomas in the u.s. virgin islands. rich steck, a spokesman for miami-based royal caribbean cruise line, which owns the ship, said it would return to miami on wednesday night after a coast guard safety inspection rather than continue the cruise. in washington, the national transportation safety board said a two-member team would meet the ship at miami to investigate the fire. steck said the fire, which started in a pantry between the fifth and seventh decks, apparently was caused by an electrical problem, but no details were available. it took about 4 1/2 hours to extinguish the blaze, the coast guard said. the 2,318 passengers and most of the 818 crew members were evacuated to a nearby port terminal before they were allowed to return to the ship at daybreak, steck said. the 74,000-ton sovereign of the seas is one of the world's heaviest cruise ships and the largest in terms of its passenger capacity of 2,521, steck said.
