the attack on clarence thomas, which boggled tens of millions of viewing americans, makes sense only if one understands that the roots of the struggle extend back to 1980 and ronald reagan's election to the presidency. we have argued continuously during these years that this argument was false, that the voters had indeed entrusted ronald reagan with a mandate (his campaign positions were clear) and that the losing side was trying to overturn the results of these elections. they have now given their consent in three successive presidential elections to a direction that can fairly be called conservative. the difference, however, between the american people and the permanent political establishment in washington is that washington no longer feels constrained by the american political system. they seemed to be demanding a national referendum on sexual harassment, meaning a senate vote for the accuser, and instead the whole nation showed up and a big majority voted the other way -- to support clarence thomas. now, with clarence thomas heading for the court and the voters going back to their daily lives, what has been learned? as for clarence thomas, we don't agree that he joins the court in a damaged state.
