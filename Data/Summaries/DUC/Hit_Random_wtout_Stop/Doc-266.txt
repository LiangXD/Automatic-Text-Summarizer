shining path rebels have formed a new front to push their insurgency into lima and other coastal urban areas, president alan garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded within blocks of the government palace. the president, who leaves office july 28, said the newly formed people's defense revolutionary movement, is the "urban, metropolitan organ of the shining path." at least 18,500 people have been killed in political violence related to the decade-old insurgency, which was launched in the andean highlands. the raids also proved that the new urban front has been formed, garcia said: "the people who were captured were essential to the new movement." two people were injured in the car bombings near the government palace on tuesday night and wednesday and garcia called the upsurge in urban violence a "desperate response" to the weekend raids. in pre-dawn attacks wednesday, guerrillas threw gasoline bombs at a city bus and at a stove factory owned by a senator-elect of fujimori's change 90 party, according to police. operating out of its stronghold in ayacucho, the shining path has spread throughout peru's highlands since it launched its armed insurgency in may 1980.
