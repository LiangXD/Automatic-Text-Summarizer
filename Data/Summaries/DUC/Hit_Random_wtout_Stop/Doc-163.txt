the calm waters of prince william sound have stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in u.s. history, which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid chunks of ice, officials said. dan lawn, an engineer for the state department of environmental conservation, said the captain could not steer the exxon valdez back on course in time to avoid a collision. the flow in the trans-alaska oil pipeline also was reduced to 800,000 barrels daily from 1.2 million barrels. alyeska spokesman tom brennan said that, at the reduced rate, the marine terminal's capacity would allow nine days of operation before the line would have to be shut down. the sound is considered a playground for kayakers, sport fishermen and tourists. but the spill likely will draw increasing fire from environmentalists sensitive about the trans-alaska pipeline and efforts to open the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil development. valdez city manager doug griffin said the 800-mile trans-alaska pipeline which carries oil from prudhoe bay to valdez and the marine terminal have an enviable environmental record.
