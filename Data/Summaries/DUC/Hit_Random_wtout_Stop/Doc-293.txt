a major earthquake registering 7.2 on the richter scale shook the solomon islands in the south pacific today, the u.s. geological survey says. major earthquakes in the solomons usually don't cause much damage or many casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not extensively developed. the survey's earthquake monitors in golden, colo., said early seismograph readings placed the epicenter of saturday's earthquake about 200 miles southeast of honiaria, which is on guadacanal island and is the capital of the solomons. the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. an earthquake of 3.5 on the richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
