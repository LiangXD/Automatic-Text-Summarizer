the focus of the drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most areas, the national weather service reported thursday. the heavy rain which has hit portions of texas is expected to diminish. long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the great lakes region and the ohio and tennessee valleys, the agency's climate analysis center reported. and a separate climate assessment added that many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months. recent rains have resulted in local flooding in texas, but nationally streamflows are below normal, and even in texas are expected to fall back to below average levels. the only areas escaping heat in the forecast are the nation's northwestern and northeastern corners and the louisiana-texas-new mexico area. most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal, although some significant rain could penetrate northwestward from texas into new mexico, colorado and eastern wyoming.
