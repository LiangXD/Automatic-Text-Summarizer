a los angeles judge friday refused to reduce the $5-million bail for charles h. keating jr., saying the phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations. bail for robin s. symes, 37, and ray c. fidel, 32, both former lincoln presidents, was cut to $100,000. keating had sought to have bail reduced to $500,000, an amount that could be paid by his family, neal said. keating had sought to have bail reduced to $500,000, an amount that could be paid by his family, neal said. ira reiner, whose office has flip-flopped twice in its bail recommendations in the case, praised the decision not to reduce keating's bail. on wednesday, prosecutors said they were willing to recommend a reduction in bail to $1 million for keating and $50,000 for the others. the alleged crimes caused the victims to lose nearly $1.2 million, hardly serious enough to warrant such high bails, they contended.
