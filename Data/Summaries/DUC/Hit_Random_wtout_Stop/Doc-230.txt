turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at venetia, de beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from south africa's borders with botswana and zimbabwe. only weeks before the mine came into production in july 1992 at a cost of usdollars 400m, de beers' central selling organisation, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from angola. venetia's success is strategically important to de beers because, when its output is added to that in botswana and namibia, it gives the group direct control over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output. this provides a major base for the cso to work from and gives it a powerful position from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel. and, while venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected 23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour relations and environmental issues, at least as far as south africa is concerned. venetia is also breaking with the de beers' tradition that, for security reasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security area once it is no longer useful. venetia is also breaking with the de beers' tradition that, for security reasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security area once it is no longer useful.
