lawmakers clashed thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 census, debating whether following the letter of the constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens. ridge cited the 1980 census, which estimated the number of illegal aliens at 2 million. it doesn't specify citizens. "it was never the intent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment purposes." albert g. bustamente, d-texas, termed the worry over counting aliens "hysterical," pointing out that the movement of americans into western and southern states has had a much larger effect on representation than the presence of aliens. tom petri, r-wis. and william f. goodling, r-pa., asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basic right to equal representation by giving greater voice in congress to states where the aliens live. tim valentine, d-n.c., contended that counting aliens "in effect, is granting representation in congress to individuals who have entered this country by breaking the laws of the united states."
