pollock fears that congress, the coast guard and the international maritime organization are not moving fast enough to mandate safeguards, despite 176 deaths last year in an arsonist's fire on the scandinavian star ferry in denmark, and the dramatic images of the cruise ship oceanos, which sank off south africa early in august, fortunately without loss of life. american passengers frequently assume that any ship they board in a u.s. port has met all coast guard safety requirements, a notion reinforced by coast guard approved labels on most life jackets, and fire systems on smaller boats and domestic ferries. in fact, the coast guard gives four inspections a year to ships that dock in the united states, but when the vessel is registered in another country, the coast guard only makes sure the ship provides whatever is required by international safety of life at sea regulations: twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers and life jackets for 125 percent of capacity, with the equipment in good condition. if equipment is not in order, the coast guard can prevent the boarding of passengers until things are up to snuff. when the rules were initially adopted by the international maritime organization, it was assumed that older vessels would pass out of service, but this did not happen, according to marjorie murtagh of the coast guard, the u.s. fire-safety representative at the international maritime organization. of the 100 large vessels now operating from u.s. ports -- all but two are of foreign registry -- 72 are more than 10 years old, 23 are more than 20 years old and 26 are more than 30 years old, according to figures in the coast guard magazine proceedings of the marine safety council. on the other hand, when u.s.-registered vessels are inspected, o'brien said, they are required to meet full coast guard standards, including expensive type i life vests designed to be very easy to use.
