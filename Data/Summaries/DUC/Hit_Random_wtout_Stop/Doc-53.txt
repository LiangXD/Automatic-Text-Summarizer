the president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families. americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty. the democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy. this past december, a coalition of some 80 organizations, most with headquarters in washington, issued a statement of principles calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs. it will be difficult for congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the american people are already spending more than $100 billion a year on these programs. with the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press congress to move off the deadening status quo. with the ball in its court, congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors, or it can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor.
