cloudy weather saturday threatened to mar the show for thousands of finnish and foreign skygazers hoping to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun. the solar eclipse in finland starts at 4:03 a.m. in helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon. during the past week, newspapers, television and radio have been full of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice for spectators not to stare directly into the sun. the eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide from the northern baltic sea and southeast finland, across the kola peninsula and northeast soviet union, to the aleutian islands near alaska. however, scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than in longer eclipses, such as the seven-minute eclipse seen from northern kenya on june 30, 1973. the last total eclipse to be seen in finland occurred in 1945.
