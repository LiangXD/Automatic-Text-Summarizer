"most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you," said needham in a telephone interview from golden, colo. the quake struck an area of iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, needham said. the 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said. a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.
