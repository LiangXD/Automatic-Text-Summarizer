first, the less time that a politician spends inside the beltway the less his or her common sense will be corrupted by the culture of ruling that exists there. second, term limits end the adverse pre-selection process that exists whereby most individuals seeking office today actually find the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in washington, d.c., attractive. today, business people, teachers, computer programmers and other productive citizens look at the prospect of running for congress and recognize that they must be willing to commit 10 or 15 years of their lives to being politicians if they expect to have any legislative influence. with six-year limits in the house (which most term-limit initiatives are now proposing for state congressional delegations), such individuals would recognize that they would immediately be on a par with their colleagues in congress and that they would not have to give up their productive careers in the private sector in order to serve. indeed, a true citizen congress would consist of legislators who view their time there as essentially a leave of absence from their real jobs. certainly the composition of congress under term limitation would reflect something other than 95% men and 46% lawyers, as it does now. seventy-five percent of americans support term limitation -- everyone from ralph nader to milton friedman -- because they recognize it as an opportunity for citizens to wrest control of government from an impervious congress full of check-bouncing, power-lusting professional politicians.
