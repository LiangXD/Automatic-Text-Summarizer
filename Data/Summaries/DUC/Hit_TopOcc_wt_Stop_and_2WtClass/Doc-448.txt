ash was so thick in the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights on and wipers operating to clear the windshields of volcanic debris. a photographer who circled the volcano in an airplane said an aerial gunnery range at clark was covered with ash, as were mountains in the zambales range, normally lush, green tropical peaks that now looked like the alps in winter. moments after the first explosion, sirens wailed at clark air base, and 600 of the 1,500 americans remaining there fled eastward to safety. the pentagon, which is trying to negotiate a new contract with manila for the base, said it can work around the temporary loss of clark. the americans who fled clark with a few belongings on monday moved in with sailors and their families at subic bay naval base, 50 miles to the southwest. although the air force left clark, philippine authorities have not ordered a general evacuation of angeles, a city of more than 300,000 people adjacent to the base. in the sapang bato area of angeles, the city district nearest the volcano, just 2,000 of 13,000 residents had been evacuated as of monday, officials said.
