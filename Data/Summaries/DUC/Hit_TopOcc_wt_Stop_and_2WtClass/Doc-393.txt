however, a senior defense department official said that there was no evidence of a terrorist connection friday, and some law enforcement officials described the bombing as amateurish. he said that no special security precautions had been undertaken for rogers, crew members and their families after the vincennes returned to san diego. after the bombing friday, an fbi spokesman said the rogerses' van was usually driven by sharon rogers, but two highly placed law enforcement sources told the times that will rogers drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident about an hour before the blast. a law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified, said sharon rogers told investigators that she pulled up behind three or four cars stopped at a red light at the intersection and then suddenly heard two popping sounds. when sharon rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the iranian jetliner. he said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs apparently came from one or two explosive devices, and that the apparatus was connected under the van's transmission. he noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were planted on the vehicle or that only a small amount of high-intensity explosives were used.
