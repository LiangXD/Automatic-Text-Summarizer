president reagan's national security adviser, colin powell, on thursday credited soviet leader mikhail s. gorbachev for pushing economic reform, but said it "remains to be seen" how much improvement can be made under a communist, one-party system. powell, an army lieutenant general, said it has become clear, however, that the soviets have chosen to pursue a policy of declining adventurism in foreign policy so they can focus "energies and resources on internal economic reform." but powell said the push for freedom in nicaragua has lagged, at least in part because of divisions within the united states on support for the contra rebels. "the soviets are correctly reassessing their past foreign policy, including their adventurism in the 1970s, as a series of mistakes," powell said, because they and their allies were unable to consolidate their gains. of the changing political climate in the soviet union, he said: "essentially, perestroika is an acknowledgment of the failure of the soviet system to provide for its people. but powell also said that gorbachev, who recently took on the additional title of president of the soviet union with the retirement of andrei gromyko, is facing problems with "restive nationalities in the soviet union and around the soviet empire." "there is little we can do to affect the soviet union's internal evolution," said powell, who plans to resume his active duty military career when reagan's term ends jan.
