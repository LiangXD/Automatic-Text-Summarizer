two of the plates sink beneath the islands of japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the earth directly below tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. </p> <p> most other earthquake-prone regions, including california, only have to worry about two colliding plates. </p> <p> the threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is being reclaimed from tokyo bay to serve the needs of millions more who are flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity. frank press, president of the u.s. national academy of sciences, has speculated that a great quake here would force japan to reclaim much of its foreign investment, possibly leading to a collapse of the world economy. </p> <p> tokyo was leveled once, in 1923, when a monstrous earthquake destroyed a city that had ignored the lessons offered in 1906 from a different city by a distant bay. the bay area quake suggested that tokyo too may be much more vulnerable than experts had thought. </p> <p> for this and other reasons, tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. </p> <p> a study last year by japan's national land agency concluded that if a great earthquake -- magnitude 8 or greater -- should strike tokyo in the middle of the night it would kill about 80,000 people. many experts here think even those grim estimates are far too low. </p> <p> when the great quake strikes, as everyone here knows it must, it will hit a city that is already so crowded that on a typical day it dwarfs the worst traffic jams that los angeles has to offer. </p> <p> despite widespread planning efforts, there will be few places for people to run, and it will be extremely difficult to reach safety even for those who know where to go. the modern buildings of japan are among the best engineered in the world, and even many older structures are well built because earthquakes here are so much a part of life. </p> <p> but no amount of planning can reduce the geological hazard that lies beneath tokyo. </p> <p> this is a very complex place, said yoshimitsu okada, who is in charge of the most ambitious effort in the world to predict an earthquake. shock waves striking the bedrock are reflected back up toward the surface, extending the life of the earthquake. </p> <p> the duration of the shaking is very long, said oyagi, of the national research center for disaster prevention. </p> <p> officials here know those conditions could add up to disaster for tokyo, a belief that was reinforced by kyoto university's iemura when he returned from his tour of the san francisco bay area after the oct. many of the new structures going up in tokyo these days are built on filled land, and some people here hope someday to fill in the entire bay, making room for even more people and more buildings. </p> <p> if san francisco was not an exceptional case, that trend could prove disastrous, many experts believe. </p> <p> tokyo university's shima believes there is only one answer, and that is to reverse the flow of people into tokyo. </p> <p> one group is proposing that the capital be moved out of tokyo, hoping that the forced move of government workers will result in a lower death toll when the quake hits.
