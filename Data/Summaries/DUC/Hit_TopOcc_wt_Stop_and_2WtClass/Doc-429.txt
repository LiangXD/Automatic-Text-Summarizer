keating's contributions have come under increased scrutiny since his company, american continental corp. of phoenix, filed for protection from creditors in u.s. bankruptcy court on april 13 and lincoln savings &amp loan, its principal subsidiary, was seized by federal regulators the next day. it's absolutely clear to me that mr. keating and his cohorts had lots of help from the highest quarters, both financially and politically, said joseph w. cotchett jr., an attorney representing american continental bondholders who may have lost $200 million as a result of the bankruptcy filing. today, keating contends that his contributions merely give him a fighting chance against hostile regulators who drove american continental into bankruptcy proceedings because they didn't like his unconventional business strategies and his outspoken criticism of the regulatory structure. keating was born in ohio, and american continental is incorporated there. * nearly $166,000 has gone to 11 members of the senate and house banking committees, where deregulation of the savings and loan industry was conceived and implemented in recent years, much to the dismay of some regulators. doesn't recall mondale gift with so much money flowing to so many candidates over so many years, keating apparently cannot keep track of the politicians who benefited from his fund-raising efforts. timing of contributions in his case, he said, regulators are raising the campaign contribution issue to hold senators and congressmen in check while the federal agencies deal with lincoln savings. all of the senators involved said there was no impropriety in taking money from keating and his fund-raisers and then representing him in a dispute with agency officials, something they said they do for all their constituents.
