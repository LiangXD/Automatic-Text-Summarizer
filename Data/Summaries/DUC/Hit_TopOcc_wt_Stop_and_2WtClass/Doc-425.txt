"more than half the japanese tourists who come to los angeles will also come to las vegas," said yoshi morichika, who is heading up a 1,274-acre golf and destination resort community for japanese recreation and electronics giant cosmo world. it added las vegas to the list "because the land is not expensive, yet, and there is a huge volume of japanese tourists here," morichika said in an interview. jane wilson, who handles international marketing for the las vegas convention and visitors authority, says japanese tourism has been increasing at about 20 percent a year, and is expected to jump about 27 percent this year. japanese billionaire masao nangaku, who bought the dunes hotel and casino two years ago for $157 million, is planning a 35-story high-rise office building and 300-room nongaming hotel in downtown las vegas. japanese businessman katsuki manabe, who owns more than 30 arcades in tokyo, has invested $30 million in the park hotel in downtown las vegas and millions more in his nevada-based sigma games, a gaming equipment maker. izumi, who looked at properties in hawaii but opted for las vegas because of the lower costs, has committed $30 million for the purchase and renovation of the hotel. don woodsmall, who serves with morichika as project manager of the cosmo world project, said las vegas was picked by the japanese company, in part, "because the housing market is so strong here."
