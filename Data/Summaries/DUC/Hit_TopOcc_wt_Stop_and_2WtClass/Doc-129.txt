and even at the age of 83, he probably will finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runners expected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on april 15. bill rodgers, a four-time boston marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at mr. kelley: it's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing. a two-time winner in boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, mr. kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year -- as he has been for 15 years. mr. kelley is such an institution that hopkinton, mass., where the race begins, has made him an honorary citizen. two state troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound mr. kelley into boston so he won't be trampled by groupies, as he calls them, clamoring to shake his hand. of course, mr. kelley -- not to be confused with the other john kelley, who won the boston marathon in 1957 -- isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32 minutes, 7 seconds. but i'll tell you, the boston marathon -- with all those people waving -- is better than my birthday.
