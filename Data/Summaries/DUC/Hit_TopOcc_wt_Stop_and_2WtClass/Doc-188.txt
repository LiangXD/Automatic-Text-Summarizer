people caught by hurricane hugo last year might disagree, but forecasters here say the deadly storm may have had a positive side effect _ it got the public's attention. early warnings about hugo last september allowed 350,000 people to evacuate safely, and in south carolina the worst of the hurricane struck the francis marion national forest between charleston and myrtle beach, sheets said. with slosh, forecasters can predict the height of the storm surge _ the mass of water piled up by the storm that is a hurricane's most destructive component _ anywhere along the u.s. coast by punching in a storm's speed, size and intensity, sheets said. hugo was the worst hurricane to strike the southeastern u.s. coast since betsy hit the florida keys in 1965, killing 74 before it went on to missisippi and louisiana. "no one knows for sure, but the odds are, florida and the east coast are going to get it," william gray, professor of atmospheric science at colorado state university, told a national conference of weather experts this month. he had figured the 1989 season would be relatively mild, with only four hurricanes instead, seven hurricanes and four tropical storms killed a total of 84 people. the names for atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms this year are: arthur, bertha, cesar, diana, edouard, fran, gustav, hortense, isidore, josephine, klaus, lili, marco, nana, omar, paloma, rene, sally, teddy, vicky and wilfred.
