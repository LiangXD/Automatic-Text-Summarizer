after a daylong delay that u.n. officials attributed to snow-blocked roads, anderson, chief middle east correspondent for the associated press, had appeared wednesday before his colleagues at a press conference in damascus, syria, and said, you can't imagine how glad i am to see you. the 44-year-old journalist, who was abducted march 16, 1985, by the islamic jihad faction of iranian-backed lebanese shiite muslims, looked to be in good health and said he was sustained in his long ordeal by his companions in captivity, his religious faith and his stubbornness. at the news conference in syria, anderson said his captors came to his cell tuesday afternoon with new clothes -- the first new apparel he had worn in almost seven years -- and a pair of new shoes that were pinching his feet. after the news conference, he met with madeleine bassil, whom he was planning to marry when he was kidnapped, and his 6-year-old daughter, sulome, whom he had never seen before wednesday. in washington, president bush, who called anderson in damascus to express the love and admiration that all americans have for terry, said wednesday he joined anderson's family and friends in their happiness for his return to freedom. he said his spirits were kept up by listening to british broadcasting corp. newscasts on a radio provided by his kidnappers in the later period of his captivity, and that he was particularly grateful for messages from his family that reached him through lebanese reporters. the good news for the hostage in the statement was brief but meaningful: we're going to free our last captive, terry anderson, thus folding this page in the hostage file before glorious christmas.
