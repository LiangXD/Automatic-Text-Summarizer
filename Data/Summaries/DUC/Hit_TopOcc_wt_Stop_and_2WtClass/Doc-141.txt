foreign minister roberto de abreau sodre of brazil told the opening session of the 42nd general assembly that the third world economic picture was dimming "due to the lack of progress in international economic relations." a similar theme sounded monday in west berlin, where finance ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded "more forceful action" to help third world countries repay $1.2 trillion in debts. brazil, with $121 billion in foreign loans, has been among the strongest third world lobbyists for debt restructuring and writeoffs. it is critical of the u.s. view that strong economic performance in developed countries would trickle down to help the third world. officials of the seven key industrialized nations in the non-communist realm _ the united states, west germany, japan, canada, france, italy and britain _ have approved a plan to aid the world's poorest nations, mostly in sub-saharan africa. prime minister gro harlem brundtland of norway said her country spends about 1.1 percent of its gross national product on loans and grants to developing countries, well above the average 0.34 percent by other developed countries. she urged other industrialized nations to increase financial aid, saying development and debt are related third world crises.
