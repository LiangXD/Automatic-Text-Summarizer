there aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay away for as long as four years, says lawrence piro, chief of cancer research at scripps clinic &amp research foundation, la jolla, calif., where the drug was developed. it is without doubt the most effective treatment for hairy-cell leukemia, in terms of rapidity of response, adds elihu h. estey, a cancer researcher at the university of texas-m.d. anderson cancer center, houston. as the disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to infection and often need blood transfusions. with the lack of toxicity and the ease with which people go into remission {with 2-cda}, i think there's something really going on here, says ellin berman, a staff leukemia doctor at memorial sloan kettering cancer center, new york. scripps said it negotiated an agreement with a subsidiary of johnson &amp johnson, new brunswick, n.j., to produce and distribute 2-cda to other centers for broader clinical trials. when you can make all the disease go away with a single infusion of therapy, you have a disease which may be able to be cured, dr. piro said. it's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments.
