relations between the uk and china have deteriorated markedly since mr patten, with the general support of the hong kong people, announced proposals on october 7 for elections in 1994 and 1995 which would allow for greater, though still limited, democracy in choosing local leaders. since then, the governor has repeatedly held out the possibility that he will proceed with his plans even in the face of opposition from china - marking a change in british policy towards hong kong and china. it would require from the people of hong kong a defiance of beijing which many of their business and political leaders have been reluctant to make for fear of damaging their interests. mr patten presented his plans to officials in beijing on a three-day visit last week and told them he needed a decision by the end of the year. on friday, lu ping, china's top official on hong kong affairs, said beijing would challenge the validity of future elections and abrogate agreements to build the colony's multi-billion dollar airport if mr patten proceeded without china's agreement. in a robust performance before a special session of the legislative council (legco) on saturday, mr patten reissued his challenge to beijing to respond with constructive alternatives to proposals he made on october 7 for the colony's political development. the governor said he was prepared to discuss these alternatives with china but reminded legislators that any alternatives had to be fair, open and command the support of the people of hong kong.
