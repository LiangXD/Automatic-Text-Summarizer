meeting this week in washington, the governors said they want to transform the current welfare system -- largely an income-maintenance system -- into more of a job-support system. these successes have encouraged the governors of new york, new jersey, washington and missouri to undertake their own reform programs. bill clinton of arkansas, even backed off earlier criticism of the administration's welfare plan, saying after the white house meeting, i feel better about the prospects of welfare reform than i did yesterday. however committed the administration and congress may be to reform, they're unlikely to endorse a plan that increases the deficit. an extra $2 billion a year added to the present anti-poverty programs (which, as we have mentioned before, if simply handed out in cash would be enough to lift every poor household in america above poverty) is unlikely to accomplish all that the governors promise. all the important players -- the president, the governors and congressional leaders -- agree that the goal of such reform is to transform the welfare system into one that enables poor families to achieve, in the president's words, real and lasting emancipation from welfare dependency. since all of the principals agree on the ultimate goal of welfare reform, it seems reasonable to expect that they can achieve a plan of action.
