police captured the top military leader of the shining path, a maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war has taken more than 10,000 lives in peru, officials said monday. officials said the capture of osman morote, 43, considered the most radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to date for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the andean highlands in may 1980. abimael guzman, a former professor of philosophy, founded the shining path movement and is generally recognized as its leader. there have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry between morote and guzman, and mantilla said he did not discount the possibility that guzman betrayed morote to get him out of the way. morote, known within the rebel band as "comrade remigio," is second in importance only to guzman, who founded the shining path as a splinter group of the peruvian communist party. the shining path devoted itself to 10 years of semi-clandestine political work with peasants in the impoverished andean highlands before taking up arms. guzman is the ideologist of the organization, but morote is considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military.
