abandoned by his father, driven by his hard-eyed grandfather and a band of nuns sent south to teach black children, young clarence learned sharecropping and scholarship, hard labor and the latin mass, and how to survive the walk home through black savannah in his catholic school uniform. from these roots, he might have become one of any number of bright, activist black men to rise out of southern poverty and press a politically aggressive liberal agenda of civil rights and affirmative action -- as did men like thurgood marshall, the retiring justice whose supreme court seat thomas might take. his grandfather proved to be a profound force in thomas' life -- a mentor, a role model, an unrelenting taskmaster and the embodiment of a personal philosophy that thomas once recalled this way: he used to tell me that there was no problem that elbow grease couldn't solve. and so thomas, who was driven from the missouri seminary by racism, became one of the beneficiaries of an effort to combat it. thomas, who paid for his college education with loans, jobs and the newly raised scholarship funds, soon was drawn into the turbulence of vietnam war and black power politics. from yale to washington thomas, always a top student, was recruited out of yale in 1974 by john danforth, r-mo., then missouri attorney general, a yale trustee and a frequent campus visitor. civil-rights groups accused thomas of failing to enforce other anti-discrimination laws as well, and of retaliating against employees who disagreed with his policies.
