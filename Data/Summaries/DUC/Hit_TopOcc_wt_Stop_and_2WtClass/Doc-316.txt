if convicted on the racketeering charges, the three could face an astronomical amount in financial penalties: the indictment asks that they forfeit a total of $1.85 billion, representing their salaries, other compensation and their share of drexel profits, all earned in what the government charges was a continuing criminal enterprise operated at the new york-based investment banking firm. immediately after the 98-count indictment was returned by a federal grand jury, drexel said that milken, 42, and his brother, 40, had requested and been granted leaves of absence. sources at the firm said the indictment of michael milken probably would clear the way for drexel to swiftly settle civil charges filed by the securities and exchange commission. he said his office has been negotiating with the defendants' lawyers and added that he expects a bond to be posted by the three men, covering at least a part of the amount they may be required to forfeit to the government. when asked about the huge amounts, among the largest that individuals have been asked to forfeit in a rico case, romano said the numbers represented the extraordinary levels of compensation and stock ownership in the (illegal) drexel enterprise paid to michael milken and the others. the indictment notes that milken received $1.1 billion in direct compensation from drexel from 1984 through 1987, as well as millions in other forms of compensation, and that he is drexel's largest individual stockholder, owning about 6% of the firm. drexel's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges pending against the firm calls for it to withhold nearly all of michael milken's compensation from 1988, as well as about $13 million owed to lowell milken.
