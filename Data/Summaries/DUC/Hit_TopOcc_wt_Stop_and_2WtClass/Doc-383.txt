a state court of appeal ruled monday that cities and counties may require applicants for jobs as police officers to submit to polygraph tests about their character and background. in a 2-1 decision, the panel rejected claims that such testing violated the state constitutional right to privacy or conflicted with statutes that bar such tests for public safety officers already on the job. the panel noted that the right to privacy was not absolute -- and said that a city's interest in ensuring its officers were of the highest integrity outweighed any harm suffered by an applicant who loses a job opportunity for refusing the test. according to attorneys in the case, at least half of the cities and counties in the state currently require applicants for public safety jobs to take polygraph tests. richard l. pinckard, a deputy city attorney representing san diego and three other cities backing vallejo in the case, said the ruling was especially important in view of state laws barring polygraph exams for officers already on the job. in support of his suit, he cited the statutes that prohibit officers from being forced to submit to such tests against their will, along with language in the 1986 state high court decision suggesting cities would bear a heavy legal burden in justifying the tests for applicants for public safety jobs. a solano county superior court rejected rust's claims and the court of appeal, in its ruling monday, affirmed that ruling, concluding that both applicants -- and ex-officers seeking reinstatement -- could be required to take the tests as a condition for getting the job.
