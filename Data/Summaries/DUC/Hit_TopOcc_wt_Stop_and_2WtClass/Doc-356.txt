yet even as the military rout continues, u.s. officials are concluding that saddam hussein is unlikely to ever accept president bush's demand that he acquiesce to all united nations resolutions condemning and punishing iraq. aside from disarming the better half of iraq's million-man army that sits in and around kuwait, the american aim is to ensure that saddam hussein isn't allowed to frame the withdrawal of his troops as a political victory. that is precisely what he attempted to do in a radio address yesterday in which he congratulated his soldiers for standing up to a 30-nation coalition assembled by the u.s. mr. bush now has plenty of cheerleaders urging him on in the humiliation of saddam hussein, even among those who doubted the wisdom of the war in the first place. for starters, the u.s. hopes that the iraqi people themselves will conclude that saddam hussein botched both his war with the u.s.-led coalition and his various attempts to stop it once it was underway. rear admiral mike mcconnell, director of intelligence for the joint chiefs, said that allied forces found a document, which he said was written to iraq's senior generals before the war started, ordering iraqi troops to inflict maximum casualties on u.s. troops and also to destroy kuwaiti oil facilities. gen. thomas kelly, director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff, said iraqi prisoners of war climbed to about 30,000, but other officials said the total may be closer to 40,000 and is growing rapidly. overall, pentagon officials described iraqi forces as confused, leaderless and battle-weary, adding that the few guard units that have engaged in tank duels so far haven't been any tougher to defeat than the rest of saddam hussein's army.
