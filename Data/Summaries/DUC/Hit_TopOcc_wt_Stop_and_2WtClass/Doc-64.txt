but thomas, who has risen in republican ranks as an advocate of bootstrap conservatism, would present a striking change from marshall, a civil-rights pioneer and an anchor of the court's declining liberal faction. while not much is known about thomas' views on most issues likely to come before the court, he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action and to policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences. views on big issues unknown thomas' views on the other major issues remain unknown, although the 1990 confirmation hearing for his seat on the court of appeals was widely viewed on capitol hill and in ideological interest groups as a rehearsal for a supreme court nomination. some democratic senators said at the time and again monday that their votes to confirm him for the appeals court should not be taken as endorsements for the supreme court. leaders of abortion rights groups said monday that they would press the senate to deny confirmation to thomas unless he expresses his support for the supreme court's abortion precedents, including continued adherence to roe vs. wade, the 1973 ruling that established the constitutional right to abortion. at his side stood a black man who was 5 years old when marshall won his supreme court argument in brown vs. the board of education and who was a college freshman when marshall joined the supreme court. well before bush presented thomas to the country monday, it was clear that that chapter in the court's history is largely closed and that a new page was about to be turned.
