but it has offended some, especially in arab countries, who now believe that mr. bush's real objectives are the demise of saddam hussein and the destruction of the iraqi military, not just the liberation of kuwait. despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still suffer greater casualties and become bogged down militarily, especially when they encounter the tough republican guard, which is entrenched along the iraq-kuwait border. secretary of state james baker said on abc-tv's this week with david brinkley that the series of united nations resolutions condemning iraq's invasion of kuwait imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in iraq. u.s. and kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from kuwait city are being rounded up and held by iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over. and robert gates, mr. bush's deputy national security adviser, asserted in an interview on the cable news network that iraqi troops have set fire to large sections of kuwait city. mr. bush and his aides were leaning toward a military conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of iraqi atrocities in kuwait came to light. the american hope is that someone from within iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push saddam hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster.
