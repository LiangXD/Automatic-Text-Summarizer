in choosing federal judge robert bork for the supreme court, president reagan has tapped a leading architect of conservative legal theory -- and has ensured a tough confirmation battle in the senate. the selection of the 60-year-old judge bork to replace retiring justice lewis powell gives the president his third supreme court appointment and by far his greatest opportunity to alter the court's direction. but in judge bork, appointed by mr. reagan in 1982 to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia, the president has picked a rare judicial -- rather than a political -- conservative, a judge committed to a narrow role for the courts rather than to the reagan administration's political agenda. the only questions were whether to go with a younger conservative whose influence would last well into the next century and whether the strength of judge bork's conservative views would make his confirmation too difficult. paul simon of illinois, both presidential candidates, must satisfy liberal civil-rights groups that are already gearing up to battle the nomination and at the same time must avoid embarrassing themselves by using specious arguments, especially if the fight against judge bork proves futile. it was that 1965 ruling that was the basis for the supreme court's 1973 decision recognizing a woman's right to an abortion, and judge bork's criticism of sexual privacy has caused alarm among women's groups over his nomination. but he has since modified his position, concluding that many other forms of discourse, such as moral and scientific debate, are central to democratic government and deserve protection.
