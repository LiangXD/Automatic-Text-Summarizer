hundreds of demonstrators blocked streets and train tracks today, halting most traffic in the capital to press their demands for president hussain muhammad ershad to resign. stores and offices closed, apparently out of fear of attacks, when what was intended to be a blockade of transport turned into a general strike. protesters paraded through the streets shouting "down with ershad!" and "days of autocracy are over!" the blockade was the latest tactic in the campaign by opposition parties to force ershad to quit. ershad has dismissed the campaign against him as "the work of a handful of violence-mongers who are out to destabilize bangladesh." he later resigned from the military and was elected president in 1986 in balloting that opposition parties, foreign diplomats and journalists said was rigged. the opposition parties say they will boycott the vote unless ershad resigns and hands over power to a caretaker government.
