mexico, where sun worship has passed from ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers, is gearing up early for the day next year when the sun will be blotted out. president carlos salinas de gortari has appointed a cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as "the slar eclipse of the century" on july 11. posters have been placed in mexico city subways promoting the event, and resorts along the eclipse's path are scrambling to accommodate the expected rush of tourists. "it's the most important eclipse in history," says miguel gil guzman, secretary-general of the mexican astronomical society. this one will cut a swath across one of the most populous regions of the globe, turning day to night for an estimated 50 million residents in 14 of mexico's 31 states. the national university is developing six half-hour documentaries on eclipses and 10 tv spots on the dangers of looking at the sun, astronomy professor jesus galindo says. since september, the university newspaper has been publishing installments of a book called "eclipse" that will be translated into indian languages.
