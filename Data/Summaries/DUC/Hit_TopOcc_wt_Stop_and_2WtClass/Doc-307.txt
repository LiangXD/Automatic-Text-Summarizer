clint bolick, vice president of the institute for justice in washington and a close friend of judge thomas, says that the weekend hearings will deepen his sympathy for victims and will reconfirm his very strong belief in individual rights. his lingering anger toward women's groups could also affect his thoughts on abortion -- the most controversial issue before the court, and an issue on which judge thomas has said he has no current view. on the other hand, liberals hope that his experience at the hands of the senate will have sensitized judge thomas to the rights of people charged with wrongdoing. claudia withers of the women's legal defense fund says that such expressions of hostility by judge thomas give us the concern that he wouldn't look favorably on claims by interest groups that advocate abortion rights before the supreme court and that also opposed his nomination. judge thomas will have an opportunity to apply his criminal-law views in the case of jacobson vs. u.s., which is scheduled to be argued next month. in the end, some critics of judge thomas worry that his recent experiences will send him onto the court as an embittered man bent on revenge against his perceived tormentors. but john danforth, judge thomas's most passionate defender in the senate, says going through the agonies of hell has made clarence thomas more sensitive to civil rights, to the necessity of legal protection of the people of this country, than most people who could conceivably be nominated for the supreme court.
