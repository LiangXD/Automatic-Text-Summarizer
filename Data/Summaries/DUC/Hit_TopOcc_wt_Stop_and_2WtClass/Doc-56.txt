thomas j. downey, d-n.y., in the democrats' response, said that quiring welfare recipients work may be necessary, but he said such requirements should be controlled by state and local welfare officials, not the federal government. to deal with this, he said, his administration launched a program encouraging states to come up with their own plans to get people off the welfare rolls. "nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old common sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work," the president said. downey said that while more people than ever before are working, "the fact is that the typical worker in america is no better off today than he or she was 10 years ago in fact things have gotten worse." the poorest 40 percent of american families, with incomes adjusted for inflation, are worse off today than they were 10 years ago the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decade ago and 32.5 million americans remain mired in poverty, he said. the house bill, with training and education programs as well as health and child-care benefits, would make welfare parents who work better off than those who do not, said downey, acting chairman of the ways and means subcommittee on public assistance and unemployment compensation. "yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary, but those requirements should be controlled by state and local officials who administer our welfare programs, not federal bureaucrats," downey said.
