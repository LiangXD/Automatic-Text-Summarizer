the profusion of pine seeds is just one of the rejuvenating forces at work in yellowstone even as the fires, largely quenched this week by rain and snow, still smolder. critics, including elected officials from western states and the logging and tourist industries, have grabbed headlines by blaming that policy for fueling the inferno that this summer raged over half of yellowstone's 2.2 million acres and cost more than $100 million to fight and clean up. reforestation would give wooded areas in yellowstone a five-year jump on natural regrowth of the woods and would get it green again, says john davis, willamette industries inc.'s general manager for western timber logging operations in lewiston, idaho. new jersey's governor, thomas kean, for instance, announced that his state planned to donate thousands of evergreen seedlings to replant yellowstone, apparently without realizing that none of the proffered species are indigenous to the park. in addition to his seed-counting, mr. despain has created nine before and after study plots to gauge effects of the fire. driving along the 140 miles of the park's upper and lower scenic loop -- on roads open to park visitors -- one sees a yellowstone that is a patchwork of green, brown and blackened forest and meadow. wyoming's u.s. senators, republicans malcolm wallop and alan k. simpson, are mindful of the damage the fires caused the state's tourist industry this year, as well as the threat to gateway towns near the park.
