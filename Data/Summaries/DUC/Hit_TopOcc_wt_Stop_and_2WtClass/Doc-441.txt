'only god can help us through this crisis,' said the afrikaner preacher called to provide spiritual guidance to south africa's farmers, who have been hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory. mr jg wilson of the local agricultural co-operative says maize farmers in the area - one of the largest maize producing regions - have already lost 80 to 100 per cent of their crops. the maize board, the state marketing board, expects a crop of 4m tonnes, though mr du toit believes it could be closer to 3m or 3.5m, which would make it the worst harvest in 50 years. government, for its part, has said that it will act to prevent farmers leaving the land this time - although it has little room for manoeuvre, given the fragility of the country's political transition, the depressed economy and the demands of blacks for a fairer share of government spending. without such aid, the maize board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de grace. millions of black subsistence farmers will also be victims of drought, with the charity operation hunger warning that hunger could turn to starvation soon in many rural areas. real gross domestic product has been forecast to rise by 1.5 per cent this year, though that figure could prove much too optimistic if the worst drought predictions are borne out.
