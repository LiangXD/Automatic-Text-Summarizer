cheers erupted saturday on both sides of the english channel when british and french workers digging the channel tunnel finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through and shake hands. using jackhammers, graham fagg, 42, of dover, england, and philippe cozette, 37, of calais, france, knocked out the last foot of chalk to link up the british and french sides of the tunnel -- which has been dubbed a chunnel. the $16.7-billion channel tunnel will make it possible to travel from paris to london by high-speed train in 3 1/2 hours when it opens in june, 1993. the tunnelers have spent the last month drilling through the last 100 yards of chalk with giant american-built boring machines, trying to align the two halves. fagg and cozette were chosen by draw from among the 3,000 workers to represent their countries in saturday's meeting. michel delebarre and malcolm rifkind, the french and british transportation ministers, rode in small service trains down the maintenance tunnel to witness the handshake. many britons fear drug traffickers or terrorists will invade their island via the tunnel.
