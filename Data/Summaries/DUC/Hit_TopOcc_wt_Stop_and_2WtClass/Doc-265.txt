the maoist shining path guerrillas who dominate peru's upper huallaga river valley have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region. "two years ago you could not travel the roads without being held up, but the 'companeros' put an end to that," said cab driver david nicolas, referring to the guerrillas by the spanish term for comrades. in a rare conversation with reporters, a shining path political officer, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, gave an example of the kind of law the guerrillas have laid down: "do not steal so much as a needle or thread and return what you borrow." "people have had to discipline themselves," said raul aranda, an agronomist in tingo maria, explaining the effects of "revolutionary justice." in the bleak andean highlands, where the rebels launched their insurgency in may, 1980, they have slain thousands of peasants in attacks on villages they viewed as traitors to the rebel cause. but here in the jungle-cloaked upper huallaga valley, the world's largest source of coca leaf, the shining path _ "sendero luminoso" in spanish _ enjoys the support of tens of thousands of farmers because the rebels protect them against a u.s.-funded coca eradication program. the rebels charge coca farmers a "tax" of 10 to 15 percent on the earnings from the sale of their crops to drug traffickers, who process the leaf into paste and sell it to colombian cocaine dealers.
