"if you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a so-called peace dividend, you will get neither," gen. colin powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said in a speech to the national press club. powell's blunt remarks were his first major commentary on the debate over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of lessened east-west tensions. a former national security adviser, powell now serves as the president's primary military counselor and coordinator of the nations' military leaders. powell said that even though the berlin wall has fallen and the warsaw pact has nearly evaporated, he has had to place the american military in dangerous situations during his brief stint in office. "we must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the enduring realities we face," powell said. powell said defense secretary dick cheney's plan released earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five years shows "we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal." the administration budget blueprint, powell said, will begin to reduce the nation's forces over time.
