supporters of free markets and the capitalistic system reject this message because they have faith in the self-interested consumer to discipline the companies that do not deliver the goods. the only respectable argument in favor of term limits that i know of refers to the legislature and involves the interaction with the seniority system. even if seniority is a net cost in the aggregate, however, each district has an incentive to re-elect its own incumbent (and would if possible vote against the incumbents from other districts) because the representative's relative seniority translates into a large share of governmental largess. the formal system of seniority is also only a part of the story members' increasing familiarity with interest groups is a kind of seniority that would not be eliminated by changes in the rules for committee assignments, staffing and so on. voters do not have to worry that rejecting their incumbent puts them at a disadvantage relative to other voters' incumbents, so the electorate can properly weigh experience, fresh ideas, the value of rewarding satisfactory performance in office, and so on. the only defense for executive term limits is that the electorate needs to be protected against itself, an argument which, if true, would mean that democracy was seriously flawed and would work much less well than it seems to. the answer, if one holds constant geographical region and the level of per capita income in 1960, is that states with term limits experienced slightly below average growth of per-capita income over the last 30 years but were also a little below average in the fraction of state product that went to state and local government expenditures.
