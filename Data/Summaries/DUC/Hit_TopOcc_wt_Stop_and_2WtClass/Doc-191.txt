the last to hit miami was cleo, a small one, in 1964, and the intervening period of calm defies all odds. what would one of those legendary storms of the past with 200 mph winds pushing huge tidal surges do to this low-lying metropolis on the atlantic? about 20 of them intensify into stronger disturbances, ranging from tropical depressions, with wind speeds to 38 mph to tropical storms, with winds from 39 to 73 mph to hurricanes, with winds exceeding 74 mph. that storm was almost exactly the strength of hurricane hugo, which hit in south carolina with 135 mph winds in september 1989. a worst-case storm, with winds topping 150 mph, would put 5 feet of water in joe's stone crabs restaurant, a miami beach landmark, and 9 feet of water on biscayne boulevard in downtown miami. hurricanes change direction and intensify in a matter of hours and, in 24 hours, the specialists said, they could miscalculate one's track by 100 miles. this, and the number of years since the last major storm hit, has spawned a certain complacency among residents that the specialists find disturbing.
