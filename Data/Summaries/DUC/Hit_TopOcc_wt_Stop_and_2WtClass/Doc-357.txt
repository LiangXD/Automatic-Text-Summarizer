he said that secretary of state james baker will ask the security council to begin arranging the war's conclusion, and that mr. baker will travel to the gulf next week for consultations on establishing a permanent peace. although mr. bush took pains to note that no one country can claim this victory as its own, the triumph will clearly leave the u.s., along with its friends in egypt and saudi arabia, as the dominant powers in the middle east. as the final tank clashes drew to a close it became clear that allied success came only at a grisly cost in iraqi lives, a reality that could increase the volume and anger of radical voices in the region. at this point, making it very clear saddam hussein has been defeated and there are no illusions about it is good -- provided that we know how to play the next phase, said william quandt, a former national security council middle east analyst now with the brookings institution. the overall security and prestige of america's friends, of course, is sure to be enhanced by the crushing defeat allied forces have dealt to what was widely considered the arab world's best army. so mr. assad is gambling that he will be able to use the iraqi defeat to enhance his own strength in the region and secure his control over lebanon while the u.s. and other western countries keep silent in appreciation for his help in the gulf. mr. bush and other officials were miffed that so little appreciation was expressed for u.s. efforts to eliminate the iraqi military threat.
