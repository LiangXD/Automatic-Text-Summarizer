lightning has set the west ablaze this summer, and electricity is again surging through the nation's wildfire command post. but this year is different because the center's strategists and quartermasters who direct the nation's wildfire battles can see some of the worst blazes from their windows. on saturday, there were about 220,000 acres ablaze in four states, with 102,000 of them in idaho and the rest in oregon, california and utah. in the logistics center, specialists spin lazy susans with pink and blue requisition forms as each plea from the fire line is answered. world war ii navy bombers _ pb-4y2s and neptunes _ are lined up on the flight deck, spattered with red retardant. they fill up again and again with thousands of gallons of "slurry," a fertilizer-based substance that stops fires cold. it will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the nation's fires.
