from hawaii to mexico to central america, more than 40 million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible. clouds obscured eclipse as totality arrived at sea level on the big island, the sun was hidden by a cloud layer. i came especially for this, and hope we get to see it, said margaret macleod, a mathematics and science teacher from manhattan beach shortly before the eclipse in hawaii. more than a hundred sun gazers showed up at the branham lane park in south san jose with almost as many gizmos to help them spot sunspots and watch the moon cross the sun. at the children's discovery museum in downtown san jose, hundreds of youngsters and adults made cardboard telescopes, which projected the eclipse on white cards through a needle hole opening. paul stonecipher , a discovery museum staff guide, said, we wanted to make little theaters for all of the kids to see the eclipse without burning their eyes. more than 500 astronomers and tens of thousands of amateurs flocked to the islands to sell nearly everything under the sun.
