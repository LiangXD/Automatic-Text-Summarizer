u.s. tour operators are planning to send a record 4,000 or more travelers to antarctica, prompting calls for strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife and the very fate of the frozen continent. "the number of tourists visiting antarctica has more than tripled in the past five years," said bruce manheim, a washington activist of the environmental defense fund who calls existing controls inadequate. 22. manheim's appeal is urging the government to place strict controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on tourist observation of penguins and seals, and coordination of cruise ship visits to breeding grounds. "we have tried, and we believed we have dealt succesfully with the explosion of antarctica tourism," said jack talmadge of the national science foundation, which regulates u.s. activities in antarctica. talmadge said the nsf has issued tourist regulations, established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and taken steps to limit visits to u.s. research stations. "antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the united states, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international level," said manheim. "the tourist visiting antarctica is a determined environmentalist, an avid lover of wildlife, and i can assure you that no tourist _ not one _ has hurt or killed a bird or animal," said lars eric lindblad, an antarctic travel pioneer who will lecture aboard the ocean princess.
