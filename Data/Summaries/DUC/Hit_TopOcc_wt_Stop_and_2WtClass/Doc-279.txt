average citizens, the pollsters found, believe they simply are not being heard in washington, and more and more are losing confidence in the electoral system as a means of influencing government. term limits would accomplish few of their proponents' goals -- more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists. more important, lawmakers ought to overhaul the disgraceful campaign-finance system to make congressional elections more competitive, and to reduce the role of money and influence peddlers in campaigns. mr. ferris believes this would put a vitality in the system while not resulting, unlike overall term limits, in a bunch of neophytes who'd be more dependent on staff and lobbyists. mr. ferris notes that the current system, in which a lawmaker gets a cherished committee assignment in his first or second term and then stays there for the rest of his tenure, breeds staleness. technology and economics and world dynamics are moving so quickly, but many of these members, while very bright, are locked into outdated beliefs and approaches, he says. if lawmakers had to change areas of expertise every three or four terms, they wouldn't have the luxury of being intellectually lazy.
