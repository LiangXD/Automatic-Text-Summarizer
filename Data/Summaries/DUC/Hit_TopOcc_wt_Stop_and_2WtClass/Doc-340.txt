washington, dragging its feet all the way, needs steady pressure to accept the compromise. while other nations -- including japan, germany and new zealand -- pushed for a permanent ban on commercial exploitation, u.s. and british delegates held out for a short moratorium. the draft specifies that, when the moratorium expires, it may be lifted only with approval of two-thirds of the signatories. next month, the original antarctica treaty will celebrate its 30th anniversary. what better way to honor a model international agreement than to continue its tradition of preserving antarctica for scientific research, and keeping it off-limits to military bases, commercial development and mining. with a climate harsher than the arctic's, it has less capacity for absorbing intervention and abuse. it may turn out that preserving antarctica will reap humankind more benefits than the yield from digging up and selling off all its gold, silver and oil.
