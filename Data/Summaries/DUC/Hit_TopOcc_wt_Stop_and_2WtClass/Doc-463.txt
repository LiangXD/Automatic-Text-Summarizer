this string of actions is the inevitable result of the change of britain's policies toward china and its stubborn perseverance in violating the sino-british joint declaration, the principle of convergence with the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region and the relevant agreements and understandings reached between the two countries. these actions fully show that the british side has closed the door of negotiations between the two sides and is finally taking a road of confrontation with china on the issue of hong kong's political system. it is known to all that shortly after patten became hong kong governor in 1992, he began to sell his political bill step by step under the pretence of increasing democracy in hong kong, in an attempt to change hong kong's present political structure and pull the pro-british elements and those who are opposed to china onto the political stage, so as to turn hong kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity which cannot be controlled by the central government of china after 1997. recently, patten made a special trip to australia and tried his best to win support from outside hong kong for the passage and the implementation of his political bill. the british side time and again said that patten's political bill was aimed at promoting hong kong's prosperity and stability and completely considered the aspirations of the hong kong residents. in accordance with these provisions, the chinese side has reiterated that as component parts of the british political body administering hong kong, the last british-hong kong district boards, the two municipal polls and the legislative council will definitely be terminated together with the end of the british administration of hong kong. before the chinese and british sides reach an agreement on the arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the partial electoral bill passed by the british-hong kong legco or any other electoral bill possibly yet to be passed by the legco cannot remain beyond the year 1997.
