britain and france were linked beneath the english channel on tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported. management sources at transmanche link, the construction consortium building the "chunnel" - the channel tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when british workers sent the probe through to french colleagues. the basic goal of the channel tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between london and paris in about three hours. french workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their british counterparts and relayed the news to transmanche officials. a work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding more pay on the french side appeared likely monday to stall the linkup until the weekend or beyond. the chunnel actually consists of three tunnels - two for railway trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between them. taking into account all the tunnels, 80 percent of the drilling has been completed by giant, japanese-built boring machines working from calais and folkstone, england.
