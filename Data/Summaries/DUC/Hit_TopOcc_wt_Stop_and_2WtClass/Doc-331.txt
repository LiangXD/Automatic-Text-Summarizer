as chief of staff, sununu has been given wide latitude by bush to manage domestic policy issues while the president devoted his attention to foreign affairs. sununu offered his resignation in a handwritten letter given to bush as the president was flying on air force one from washington to bradenton, fla., on tuesday morning. i have always said i wanted to serve as chief of staff as long as i could contribute to your success and help deal effectively with both the issues and the arrows, sununu wrote. until recently, i was convinced that even with the distorted perceptions being created, i could be a strong contributor to your efforts and success. bush, in a dear john letter in response, praised the 52-year-old sununu and said he wanted him to stay in the white house as a counselor with cabinet status through march 1. gop consultant charles black said it became clear sununu had to go when he became the story and prevented bush's own message on the economy and other domestic issues from getting through. the resignation came amid bush's struggle to arrest a sharp decline in his public approval rating, fueled by persistent concerns that the economy is headed into another recession and that the president has been inattentive to domestic needs.
