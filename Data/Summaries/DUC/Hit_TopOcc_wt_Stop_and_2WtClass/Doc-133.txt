patience was its own virtue in the long beach marathon sunday, as the men's and women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take a toll on the runners. rex wilson of new zealand patiently waited for the lead pack to sort itself out, took the lead at 10 miles and rolled to a victory in 2 hours 12 minutes 27 seconds, a course record. run as a race within a race was the pacific rim marathon, which consists of teams from invited countries. wilson and yanmin won both the long beach marathon and the pacific rim race, for total prize money of $9,500 each. viktor gural of the soviet union, who had been among the leaders for most of the race, said he had trouble with everything. gural emphatically said it was too hot, the sun went to work, was how he put it, and he said he experienced tenderness in his liver during the race. asked if she was ever aware of yanmin during the race, konatz laughed.
