three hours of steady rain monday afternoon provided a much-needed edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared 1,650 acres in shoshone national forest in wyoming, and rainfall in neighboring yellowstone national park calmed three smaller fires there. meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze that raged across 2,200 acres near yosemite national park in california over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-day fire in michigan's hiawatha national forest under control monday after the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres. four 20-person firefighting crews from colorado, utah and south dakota were expected to arrive at the fire by monday night, putting the total number of firefighters at about 430. meanwhile at yellowstone, park spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said that because the three fires there all were in the backcountry, no firefighters were trying to douse the flames. at least 60 forest service firefighters brought the hiawatha forest fire under control monday, spokesman dale bluedorn said from the national forest's headquarters in escanaba, mich. the fourth of july was no holiday for firefighters from national forests in wisconsin, minnesota, idaho and other states who were shipped to michigan's central upper peninsula to battle the hiawatha blaze, bluedorn said. forest service officials, meanwhile, began assessing damage to the 920 acres of national forest and 210 acres of private woodlands burned after the fire broke out friday afternoon, bluedorn said.
