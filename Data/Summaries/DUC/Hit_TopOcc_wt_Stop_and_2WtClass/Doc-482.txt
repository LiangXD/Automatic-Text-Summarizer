a minimum wage is a convenient and effortless way for a left-of-centre government to appear to be doing something about the problems of poverty, public sector pay and the growth of unskilled employment. most us studies of the effects of the minimum wage over the past few decades have found a moderately negative impact on employment, mainly among young people. a recent study of the effect of extending the mainland minimum wage to puerto rico in 1974 found a more dramatic employment effect. by 1980 the federal minimum wage was 75 per cent of the average wage in puerto rico's manufacturing industry compared to 43 per cent on the mainland. its unemployment rate rose from 11.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent between 1974 and 1983, of which over one third is estimated to be a direct result of the rise in the minimum wage. one of the most careful, directed by mr lawrence katz and mr alan krueger of harvard and princeton universities, surveyed the wage and employment practices of 314 burger king, wendy's and kentucky fried chicken restaurants in texas in august 1991. on average, the restaurants that had to increase their wages by more tended also to have a larger increase in employment, as the right-hand chart shows.
