it is ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by miners in angola and canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the world's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market. the onset of the dry season and the fall in river levels from the end of may this year has encouraged what de beers, the south african group that dominates the world diamond business, describes as 'a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply of illicit angolan diamonds reaching the market'. but the cartel has ensured that rough (uncut) diamond prices have risen steadily since the 1930s - even when in the depths of the 1981-86 recession the price of a top-quality, one carat gem diamond slumped in the retail market from dollars 60,000 to dollars 10,000. the cso has been mopping up as many of the smuggled angolan diamonds as possible to stop havoc being created in a business already suffering severely from soggy demand in the us and japan, the two biggest markets, which share about two-thirds of demand between them. 'what the cso for many years has done successfully, is to operate a buffer pool, stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand is in excess of the level of supply. in this way it has been able to preserve an essential degree of stability in the price of this ultimate luxury of gem diamonds, to the common advantage of producers, processors and consumers of this unique natural product.' de beers has taken good care that merchant stocks have never again been built for speculative reasons, frequently going to the banks, the potential financiers of stockpiling operations, to 'educate' them about the way the diamond market works.
