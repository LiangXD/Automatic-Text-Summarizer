last week, the scientific journal nature called for a start to be made on replacing the british cattle population with animals free from the infection -- which the magazine estimate would cost &pound 30 billion. the ministry of agriculture said yesterday that by the beginning of last week the total number of cattle diagnosed since november 1986 as having bse had risen to 121,898 -- six times the original prediction. last week, maff said that the numbers of confirmed bse cases in the first two months of this year showed a 20 per cent drop over the same period in 1993 -- proof, the ministry says, that the epidemic is waning. mark purdey, a somerset farmer and independent researcher, believes that the use of organophosphate pesticides, used from the 1980s as a sheep dip and to treat warble-fly infestation in cattle, could have damaged the animals' immune system, exposing them to the disease. more cautiously, maff told the sunday telegraph: we have never said we have ruled out the possibility of maternal transmission, but even if it occurs, our scientists do not believe it will do anything other than lengthen the time before the disease is eradicated. richard north, a former environmental health officer turned consultant, and a contributor to the sunday telegraph, believes that maff's statistics are being skewed to produce more optimistic figures -- claims not surprisingly rejected by the ministry. if the disease has jumped from sheep to cattle -- and cases have also been reported in kudu antelope at london zoo -- could it affect humans?
