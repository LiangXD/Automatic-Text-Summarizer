what's on in las vegas is a handy biweekly magazine that lists not only entertainment and other attractions around the city, but offers much helpful general information, too. in its regular feature, what's on for the young at heart, it reports that seniors get 25% off regular rates at the st. tropez hotel, an all-suite, non-gaming hotel on harmon avenue off the strip. the column also tells of the las vegas transit system's sizable senior offer, cited in this column before but worth repeating. other features are the costs of all las vegas production shows, plus a map and toll-free numbers for all casinos and other travel services. seniors who are the second occupant in a cabin with a full-fare passenger get 50% off the regular cruise price, a savings that could be as high as $848 for a one-week cruise. at check-in, guests also receive a golden guest card that allows additional discounts at selected sheraton restaurants and shows, as well as more savings from local merchants and services. for now, no changes in senior discounts are planned at any of the hotels, which include quality inns, clarion hotels, sleep inns and rodeway inns.
