drug abusers who are infected with the aids virus and tuberculosis bacteria should be treated with medicine to prevent full-blown tb, says a study published today. in the study published in the new england journal of medicine, the tb usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis infections, not new exposures to the bacteria, in people who also are infected with the aids virus. the doctors warned that besides being at risk of getting tuberculosis themselves, aids-infected addicts who carry the tb bacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with, to health care workers and other people. while most people with the aids virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome, people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only about a 10 percent life-long risk of getting tb. the study suggests that it lowers resistance to the tuberculosis bacteria, putting people at much higher risk of tb. seven of the eight tb cases occurred in people who were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before the study began. the doctors noted that 13 people who carried hiv and tb bacteria were treated with the drug isoniazid, and none of them went on to get active tuberculosis.
