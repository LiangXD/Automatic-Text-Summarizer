will c. rogers iii was awarded the legion of merit, a top military honor, on saturday as he stepped down from command of the vincennes. rogers was given the award for his performance as commanding officer of the guided-missile cruiser, which became the focus of international controversy last july when it mistakenly shot down an iranian airliner in the persian gulf, killing all 290 people aboard. speaking from the deck of the vincennes, rogers paid special tribute to his wife, sharon, who narrowly escaped death in march when a suspected terrorist bomb destroyed her van as she was driving to her teaching job at an exclusive private school in la jolla. she literally rode the fireball out of the vehicle, sprinted to the curb, combed the shrapnel from her hair and asked a construction worker to call and inform me that she had experienced a minor mechanical difficulty, rogers said. his wife, who was seated among 500 spectators on the pier next to the ship, drew a standing ovation from the crowd as she accepted a bouquet of red roses from the navy. rogers was presented with a letter saying that while on duty in the persian gulf, his tactical skills and calm direction enabled his crew to successfully engage seven heavily armed high-speed iranian surface craft attacking the vincennes in confined and confused waters. rogers and his crew were cleared of any responsibility for the mistake in a defense department investigation last year.
