just try explaining what gatt, the uruguay round or blair house are all about - but us investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the north american free trade agreement: if congress passes the treaty next week, it will be good for the economy, good for us companies, good for the stock markets, and good for president clinton. investors believe that nafta will lift corporate profits because in a more open trading environment between the three signatory countries the us, with its superior industrial productivity rates and better-quality products, will enjoy the greatest economic benefits. investors fear that a rejection of nafta would have dangerous knock- on effects around the world, depressing share prices in the us, latin america and eventually europe, and endangering vital trade negotiations over the uruguay round. investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on nafta would throw such a spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic growth. share prices in mexico rose on wednesday and thursday, and us stocks made solid gains, following the televised debate on tuesday between vice-president al gore and ross perot, who is nafta's most celebrated opponent. nafta is playing on investors' minds because doubts over its passage through congress have arisen at a vulnerable time for stock and bond prices. although data released this week on producer and consumer prices showed that fears of rising inflation are, at least for now, unjustified, equity investors remain nervous about rising bond yields.
