some 160km west of tokyo in japan's coastal tokai region is what may be the world's most dense array of geophysical instruments. the data are telemetered to tokyo where they are monitored around the clock in the hope that six experts, to be summoned at a moment's notice, will recognise unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake. long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, japan continues to spend dollars 2.5m (pounds 1.6m) a year monitoring the tokai region and close to dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research. in japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the tokai area was overdue for a significant quake. unfortunately, it has proved impossible to conclude consistently and definitively whether the signspredictors look for - swarms of small earthquakes, unusual bulges and creeps in the earth's crust, sudden changes in geomagnetism or electrical resistivity - are precursors or simply background geologic noise. japan has had numerous killer quakes outside the tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off the coast of hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives. kiyoo mogi, chairman of the six-member panel that will make the call on the tokai earthquake and former head of the university of tokyo's earthquake research institute, says several factors make the tokai region more suited than others for what he calls 'a national experiment'.
