mr nicholas oppenheimer, chairman of the group's central selling organisation, argues that if botswana chose not to sell its production exclusively through his organisation, the cso's ability to regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised. however, idc (holdings), a london-based group which claims to be the most experienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the cso, suggests the cso's attitude 'is unreasonable and based on a conceptual argument with little substance in fact.' if botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth about usdollars 100m, independently of the cso - which sells about dollars 4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to market stability, idc said. 'this profit is disproportionate to the sale of diamonds by debswana (de beers' subsidiary in botswana) to the cso as a percentage of the cso's total sales profits,' idc says. 'it is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that botswana is the only major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the cso has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the cso on the sale of its diamonds.' there has been a special relationship between the cso and botswana since 1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to de beers in exchange for an estimated usdollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the south african group. de beers, which itself mines about 40 per cent of the world's annual rough diamond output, markets stones from angola, australia, namibia, tanzania, zaire and the soviet union, as well as south africa and botswana.
