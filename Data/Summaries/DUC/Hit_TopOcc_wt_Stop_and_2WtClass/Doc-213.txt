now, in the wake of that firestorm, local firefighters are looking up at the hills that surround this area and wondering not whether, but only when and where. the tendency is to have bigger fires that are much more expensive to put out, with much more property loss, said roy pike, a deputy chief in the california department of forestry and fire protection's santa rosa office. and increasingly, fire officials worry about wildfires spreading into even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills, where numerous trees create an urban forest. we could have a fire going from rooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city, if the weather conditions are right, said san jose fire chief robert osby. challenge for firefighters many of the south bay's most vulnerable areas -- such as redwood estates above los gatos and emerald lake hills above redwood city -- began as colonies of summer homes, a handful of secluded cottages strung along narrow winding roads. and for every community, like saratoga, that requires fire-retardant roofs, there are others, like los altos hills, unwilling to suffer even that inconvenience. seven years later, the los altos hills revolt against fire-retardant roofs still resonates in the mind of los altos fire chief dick landrum, whose department is charged with protecting the area.
