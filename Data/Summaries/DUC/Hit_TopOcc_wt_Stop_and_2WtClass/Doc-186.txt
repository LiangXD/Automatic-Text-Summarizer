the names will be different, but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of hugo and gilbert may be prowling the atlantic, caribbean and gulf of mexico in the future. the probability of more intense hurricanes in the atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s, says meteorologist william m. gray of colorado state university, who analyzes hurricane patterns. last year's gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across jamaica and the mexican yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the western hemisphere. this september's hugo, which ripped through the virgin islands and puerto rico before clobbering south carolina, had sustained winds of 150 m.p.h. and an atmospheric pressure of 918 millibars (27.1 inches). officially a 4 on the saffir-simpson scale, it may be a borderline 5, says meteorologist mark zimmer of the national hurricane center in miami. but in the 1990s, he warns, u.s. destruction will be at least four to five times more costly than in the '50s and '60s, because of the boom in population and property development along coastal areas. the threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded, says meteorologist kerry emanuel of the massachusetts institute of technology.
