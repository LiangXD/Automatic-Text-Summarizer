once other brokerage houses decided to go after the junk business, milken's competitive juices -- and his obsession with controlling every aspect of everything in his life -- compelled him to do whatever sleazy things it took to nail down business. if junk had stayed a backwater -- and if either the enforcers at the securities and exchange commission or milken's alleged superiors at drexel burnham lambert reined milken in -- he wouldn't be going to jail. to understand milken, you have to understand that when he wandered into the world of junk bonds at a third-rate philadelphia brokerage house in the 1970s, the junk market consisted of a handful of canny investors who spent their days searching through the rubble of financially distressed companies searching for securities that were better than they looked. this meant that when early junkmeisters -- saul p. steinberg of reliance insurance, laurence a. tisch of loews, carl lindner of penn central and american financial, to name a few -- wanted to buy or sell junk, they had to deal with milken. when it got big -- and when he began raising money for a band of corporate brigands to take over mainline u.s. companies like gulf oil and union carbide -- that was a different game. he was used to operating without anyone knowing what he was doing, and he didn't understand that the rules had changed, and he had to clean up his act. but that market is gone, and many of his most important junk clients -- columbia savings &amp loan of beverly hills, first executive corp. of los angeles -- are busto, and many others, such as lindner and steinberg -- seem to be in big trouble.
