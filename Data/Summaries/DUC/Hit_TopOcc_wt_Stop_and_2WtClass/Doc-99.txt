in a blow to california and other states with large immigrant populations, the senate voted friday to bar the census bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count. even if the prohibition survives, secretary of commerce robert a. mosbacher has said that he would ask president bush to veto any bill that comes to his desk with such a provision. at stake are the number of seats in congress for california, florida, new york, illinois, pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis of next year's census. federal aid to states also is frequently based on population counts, so millions of dollars in grants and other funds made available on a per capita basis would be affected. thad cochran (r-miss.) said that georgia and indiana both lost house seats after the 1980 census, and california and new york -- centers of illegal immigration -- each gained seats. pete wilson (r-calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx of immigration beyond the legal limits. opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical because the census bureau already has printed questionnaires that do not contain any question about legality of residence.
