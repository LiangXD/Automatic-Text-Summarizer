there are growing signs that hurricane andrew, unwelcome as it was for the devastated inhabitants of florida and louisiana, may in the end do no harm to the re-election campaign of president george bush. after a faltering and heavily criticised initial response to the disaster, both the president and his administration seem finally to be getting assistance to those rendered homeless and to businesses and farms that have been destroyed. in the process, mr bush has been able to call on the power of incumbency, the one asset denied his presidential rival, mr bill clinton, who is to visit florida today. as if to underline the political benefit to the president, a harris poll conducted from august 26 to september 1 yesterday showed mr bush with 45 per cent support - behind mr clinton by just five points - reflecting a closer race than other recent surveys. with mr bush constantly in the headlines, mr clinton has been left on the sidelines, able to do little more than offer sympathy and sotto voce criticism of the president's initial stumbling. contrary to its brief, but confirming a prescient recent report by a house committee that mr stickney was 'uninterested in substantive programmes', fema was caught completely unprepared by andrew, resulting in unseemly disputes between state and federal authorities over who did what in bringing relief. however, the arrival in florida of the military and the assignment of special responsibilities to mr andrew card, the young and telegenic transportation secretary, is making a difference.
