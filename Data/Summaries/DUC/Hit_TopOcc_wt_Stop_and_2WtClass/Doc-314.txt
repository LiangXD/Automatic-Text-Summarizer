michael milken, who faces insider trading charges, is seen as the wall street whiz kid who made "junk-bond" financing into the tool of choice for corporate raiders. although the move by the securities and exchange commission had been anticipated, milken and others who have made fortunes in junk bonds continued to hold their annual beverly hills spring gathering known as the predators' ball. it was business as usual at drexel, and milken was still king of the junk bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate takeovers. milken had refused to comment publicly on the scandal up until wednesday, when he issued a written statement asserting that "for the past 22 months i have been the subject of a shadow trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based on false accusations." it had been a relatively short road for milken, from head cheerleader at birmingham high school in the san fernando valley in 1964 _ actress sally field and superagent michael ovitz were among his classmates _ to the top of the nation's financial industry. he lives with his children and wife, lori _ his high school sweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the former estate of the late actor clark gable in suburban encino, an upper-middle-class section of the san fernando valley two miles from his childhood home. after studying business at the university of california, berkeley, and the university of pennsylvania's wharton school, milken went to work for drexel firestone &amp co. in philadelphia as a junior bond trader.
