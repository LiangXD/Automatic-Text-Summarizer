that sherman adams, the first assistant president and john sununu, conceivably the last of the imperial chiefs of staff, were both catapulted from governor of the granite state into national prominence is not at all coincidental. sherman adams had risen in new hampshire politics of the '30s and '40s because of his organizational abilities and the perception of his incorruptibility. when he took office, adams began a program of streamlining and reducing state government that provided a model followed three decades later for another new new hampshire governor, john sununu. sununu was elected to the new hampshire assembly in 1972, and 10 years later became governor of new hampshire on a conservative campaign theme of nuclear power, increased business and no new taxes. the state was coming out of the '82 recession and beginning a six-year boom that pumped enough revenue into the coffers to build a new state hospital and prison and still have money left over to give state employees raises. continuing the staff system that had proven itself during the war, adams noted that eisenhower simply expected me to manage a staff that would boil down, simplify and expedite the urgent business that had to be brought to his attention. thus, the spring 1958 revelations that adams had for years enjoyed free hotel accommodations and accepted the now legendary vicuna coat and an expensive rug from an unsavory new england industrialist named bernard goldfine, while at the same time interceding with regulatory agencies on goldfine's behalf, came as a major shock.
