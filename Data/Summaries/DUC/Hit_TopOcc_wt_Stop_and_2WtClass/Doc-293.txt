a major earthquake registering 7.2 on the richter scale shook the solomon islands in the south pacific today, the u.s. geological survey says. the preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit the san francisco bay area oct. major earthquakes in the solomons usually don't cause much damage or many casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not extensively developed. saturday's earthquake was the strongest in the world in five months, finley said. the survey's earthquake monitors in golden, colo., said early seismograph readings placed the epicenter of saturday's earthquake about 200 miles southeast of honiaria, which is on guadacanal island and is the capital of the solomons. that places the earthquake just east of san cristobal, the easternmost island in the solomons chain and about 1,300 miles northeast of brisbane, australia. an earthquake of 3.5 on the richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
