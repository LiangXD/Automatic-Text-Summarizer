he comes down to arson in most of his investigations _ and he and other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted in some regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames. arsonists set 172 of the 296 mark twain fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, smallwood said. the forest service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set. a policy of open grazing, with cattle free to feed on any unfenced land, was allowed in the ozarks until the 1960s, longer than in other wooded areas, smallwood said. subsistence farmers in the rural south who were interviewed by shea and his researchers claimed fire helped control ticks, snakes and disease and controlled the encroachment of trees on land where they wanted to graze cattle. aesthetics even played a part: shea and other researchers found that people living in areas where arson was common enjoyed the smell of smoke in the spring air, and believed the woods looked better "burned clean." in the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed, smallwood said.
