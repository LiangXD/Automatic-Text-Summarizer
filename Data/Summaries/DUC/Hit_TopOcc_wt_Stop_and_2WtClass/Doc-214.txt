right now the rains have caused everything to green up, but that can change in a few weeks, lisa boyd, a spokeswoman for the california department of forestry and fire protection in sacramento, said monday. the late rains have given us a real good grass crop, the catalyst to ignite heavier fuels, said fire prevention officer dick mauldin at the forestry department's morgan hill ranger unit. if we get into a period of temperatures in the 90s and 100s and it stays that way for a week or so, there is some real potential for major fires, mauldin said. we don't want to say this is the worst fire season in x years, but we are gearing up for it, said ned mackay, spokesman for the east bay regional park district. statewide, the biggest fire threat looms in the chaparral-covered coastal mountains south of santa barbara, where the moisture content of trees and shrubs is the lowest ever recorded for this time of year, boyd said. two of the forestry department's 22 ranger units -- both in southern california -- are fully staffed for the fire season now, boyd said, and all are expected to be ready by mid-june. wildfire precautions the california department of forestry and fire protection advises residents of rural areas to take special precautions to protect their homes from wildfires this summer: (box)clear at least a 30-foot defensible space of brush and dry grass around your house.
