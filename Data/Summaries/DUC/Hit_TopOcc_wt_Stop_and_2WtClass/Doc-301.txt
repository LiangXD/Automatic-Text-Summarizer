according to associated press reports, some witnesses to the crash, including an air traffic controller, said they saw blue flame coming from one of the jetliner's engines just before it hit the ground and exploded into a fireball. the board recommended that the faa order inspections of the jt8d engines to detect any pin fractures and to replace existing ones with improved pins. thomas haueter, of the safety recommendations staff of the safety agency, said that the board hadn't put out an emergency recommendation for immediate replacement of the pins because it was unclear if the problems that had occurred were merely isolated incidents or reflected system problems. john lauber, one of five members of the national transportation safety board, said at a news conference at a hotel near the airport last night that there was no evidence at this point that either engine exploded or caught fire during flight. there were reports yesterday that relatives of crash victims being flown in from phoenix were asked to switch from one northwest jet to another because of mechanical problems. faa records show that besides those incidents that involved the plane that crashed, problems with the turbine sections of jt8d-200 series engines occurred on three republic flights in the past four years. frank lautenberg (d., n.j.), chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee on transportation, predicted that the accident will accelerate movement by the congress and the transportation department to do whatever can be done -- either by hiring more maintenance inspectors or reducing air traffic to meet the capacity of the system, to reduce the chances of future accidents.
