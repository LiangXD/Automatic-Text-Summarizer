george deukmejian's top campaign fund-raiser, los angeles attorney karl m. samuelian, defend his actions as one of keating's attorneys, hired to represent the arizona businessman's interests before state regulators. asked for a simple explanation of why lincoln savings failed, prompting a federal takeover in april that could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, crawford said: if i had to pick one reason, i would have to say that probably the owner was a con man. crawford said that when he took over the department in 1985, he found that his predecessor had allowed keating to keep the original records of lincoln savings in phoenix, leaving only incomplete copies of documents for california regulators in the lincoln offices in irvine. crawford said he ordered lincoln's files to be brought back to california after he discovered keating had contributed $50,000 to arizona's attorney general in an uncontested race -- a move that persuaded him that any action by california regulators would be resisted by their counterparts in arizona. that was 54 places to hide the smoking gun, said crawford, who added: we were never on top of the problems of lincoln savings.... referring to a home loan bank board memo that said keating had attempted to have him fired, crawford said he did not know of any such effort but added that he, like federal regulators, felt beat up by the arizona businessman. wording deleted also during the hearing, state savings and loan examiner richard newsom said the state attorney general's office deleted wording in a december, 1988, cease-and-desist order against american continental that could have warned investors not to buy the company's high-risk junk bonds.
