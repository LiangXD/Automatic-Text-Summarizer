scientists missed by 150 years in dating the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tablet that also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researchers said today. but in today's issue of the british journal nature, two dutch scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened about 150 years later, on march 5, 1223 b.c. they concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tablet misidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred. in addition, the text apparently indicates that mars was visible at the time of the eclipse, the dutch researchers said. they compared those criteria and the likely age range for the tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible from ugarit. the translation of the tablet's text is not certain, and the study assumes that citizens of ugarit followed an egyptian-style calendar, for which no supporting evidence is available, he said. even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed, it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, edwin krupp, director of the griffith observatory in los angeles, said in a telephone interview.
