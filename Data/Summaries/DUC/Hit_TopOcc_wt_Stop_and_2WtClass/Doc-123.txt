when his owner died in 1846, scott sued in the state courts of missouri for his freedom, on the ground that he had lived in free territory. well known to most students of race relations is the former attorney general and secretary of the treasury's pre-civil war dictum that black people being of an inferior order had no right which any white man was bound to respect. in dred scott chief justice taney, writing for the court's majority, stated that if blacks were entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens,... {i}t would give persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one state of the union, the right... to keep and carry arms wherever they went. although much of justice taney's overtly racist legal reasoning was repudiated by events that followed -- such as the civil war and reconstruction -- the subliminal effects were felt throughout that era. it was this change in the status of the black man, from slave to freeman, that caused racist elements in the country (north and south) to agitate for restrictions on guns -- ignoring long established customs and understanding of the second amendment. the 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution, along with the various reconstruction civil rights acts, prevented gun prohibitionists from making laws that were explicitly racist and that would overtly deny black people the right to bear arms. of the 27,000 handgun carry permits in new york city, fewer than 2% are issued to blacks -- who live and work in high-crime areas and really are in need of protection.
