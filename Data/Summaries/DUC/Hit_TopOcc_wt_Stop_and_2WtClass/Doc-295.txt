a crippled united airlines dc-10 crashed a half-mile short of a runway while trying to make an emergency landing wednesday afternoon, bursting into a cartwheeling fireball that broke into what one eyewitness described as 15,000 pieces and killing at least 123 of the 293 passengers and crew members on board. tail engine explodes the plane's tail engine exploded before the crash but it was not immediately clear how the explosion contributed to what a federal aviation administration spokesman called complete hydraulic failure, an occurrence regarded as extremely rare in the wide-bodied dc-10, which has three independent hydraulic systems that operate all the plane's control surfaces on its wings and tail, and landing gear and brakes. dr. romaine bendixen, clinic commander of iowa national guard's 185th tactical fighter group, said he was the first doctor on the scene, about three minutes after the crash. in one group of six seats, a woman sitting in the middle was barely injured, her husband beside her was dead and two behind her were dead, bendixen said. hewitt graham, manager of graham flying service, a charter service and corporate aircraft maintenance firm that operates out of the building closest to the crash site, said he was in his office, answering phones, when five crash victims -- a man, his wife and young son and two other men -- walked in. survival rate remarkable c. o. miller, former chief investigator for the national transportation safety board, said the crash's survival rate was remarkable and was probably the result of the pilot's ability to maneuver the plane close to the ground before losing complete control. on july 10, a united boeing 747 was forced to make an emergency landing at miami international airport after the plane was damaged in heavy turbulence over the florida-georgia border.
