workmen tunneling under the english channel have created the first land link between britain and the continent, connecting 31 miles of tunnel in a prodigious feat of engineering and finance. it also fulfills a dream of napoleon, who wanted to send his armies through the tunnel to conquer britain. champagne corks popped and workers danced jigs after french drillers phoned news of the probe's arrival to their british counterparts. since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been seven accidental deaths on the british side and two on the french side. the tunnels were joined 13{ miles southeast of folkestone, england, the british terminus near dover, and 10 miles northwest of sangatte, near calais. the tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting for its total length of 31 miles. militant workers on the french side are striking for more pay and began a work slowdown thursday, threatening to stall the link-up.
