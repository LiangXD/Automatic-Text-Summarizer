march 24: the 987-foot tanker exxon valdez runs aground on bligh reef some 25 miles south of valdez, alaska, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil into prince william sound. oil now covers 1,000 square miles, leaking out of the sound to foul beaches along the gulf of alaska and cook inlet. june 19: exxon and other big oil companies announce plans for a voluntary network of response teams capable of handling big spills anywhere in u.s. coastal waters. 15: exxon suspends its beach cleanup for the winter, claiming it has left 1,100 miles of oiled beaches "environmentally stable" and saying its 25-week cleanup involving more than 10,000 workers was a job well done. exxon calls the conservation group unfair in its criticism of the oil spill the group calls exxon "a corporate pariah." it blames the valdez spill in part on the coast guard's "unduly friendly relationship with industry," and a reckless rush to profits by the oil industry. officials say that if convicted on all counts, the company could be fined up to $1.6 million and could be assessed an additional $700 million in penalties.
