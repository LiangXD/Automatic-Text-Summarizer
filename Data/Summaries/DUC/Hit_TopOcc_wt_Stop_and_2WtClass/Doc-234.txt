in california, labour leaders, environmentalists and the 'perotistas' supporting mr ross perot have signed a declaration of war against the north american free trade agreement. the site of the signing ceremony in sacramento sent a warning to the city's congressman, mr bob matsui, one of the leading proponents of nafta in the us house of representatives. these featured the potential chemical content of the dishes if the free trade pact becomes a reality and allegedly toxic-laden mexican produce floods into the us. equipped as information centres, the vans cruised from town to town showing films and slides of the environmental degradation in mexico. with just a shoestring budget - no more than dollars 200,000 (pounds 134,230) a year in cash - foes of nafta have worked for three years to mount a massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the american public. according to mr craig merrilees, director of california's fair trade campaign, ms brown has expressed doubt about the pact, along with the rest of the state's democratic establishment. with the expected conclusion this week of the talks over side agreements on labour and environment, both sides are preparing to crank up their lobbying efforts.
