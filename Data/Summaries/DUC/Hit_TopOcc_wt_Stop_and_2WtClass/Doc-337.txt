britain and the united states have kept their hopes of issuing mining licenses in the antarctic alive by refusing to accept proposals to turn the continent into a wildlife reserve. australia and france had proposed that antarctica be turned into a wilderness park and that the minerals convention of 1988, which took six years to negotiate, be scrapped. britain and the united states refused to discuss this proposal and insisted that the conference should talk about implementing the convention and discuss clauses that would apportion liability in the case of mining pollution. both sides refused to compromise but were aware that walking out of the meeting would have destroyed the antarctic treaty system that has controlled the region for 30 years, prevented armed conflict and promoted scientific cooperation. john heap, head of britain's delegation, said london is not prepared to discuss the wilderness park idea if it excludes all mining. french officials said the conference had been a failure because britain and the united states had refused to discuss their proposals. jim barnes, from the antarctic and southern ocean coalition, representing 300 environmental organizations, said that the wilderness park proposals were still on the table, something he said gives us more time to push our case.
