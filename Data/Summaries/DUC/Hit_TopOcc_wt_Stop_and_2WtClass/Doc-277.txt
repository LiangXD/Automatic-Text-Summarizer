by itself, the term limitation in oklahoma might be written off as a cranky act of vengeance in a state not renowned as a political trend-setter, but similar measures will be voted on in november in california and colorado. eager for straws in the wind in an otherwise trendless political year, some journalists have seen in the oklahoma vote a backlash against incumbents, a manifestation of public alienation and an ominous sign to the democrats, the party that holds the largest number of legislative seats. it is republicans, naturally enough, who seem to be the most enthusiastic puffers of term limitation, since they have the most to gain, at least in the short term, from an indiscriminate clean-out of the nation's deliberative bodies. the very weakness and vulnerability to corruption that have often plagued state legislatures usually result from the amateurism of lawmakers -- the quality that term-limitation backers now assert as a virtue. by turning out the legislators every 12 years -- or even worse, every six years -- you pretty much guarantee that those who are elected won't have much of a stake in their jobs. one thing that legislators now have going for them is that they can become conversant with public issues and so challenge, if they care to, the self-serving propaganda of the special interests. at the most basic level, term limitation is just flat-out wrongheaded and illogical: to throw everybody out when all you want to do is throw out the rascals is like burning down your house in order to get rid of the rats.
