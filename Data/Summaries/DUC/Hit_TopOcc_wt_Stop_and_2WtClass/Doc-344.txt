with the u.s. just beginning to convey a massive military force to the persian gulf region, iraqi ruler saddam hussein has a window of opportunity of about that much time to freely deploy his formidable army, possibly unleash his vast chemical-weapons stockpile and test whether the west's ships really intend to blockade his oil shipments. president bush, saying that a line has been drawn in the sand, vowed in a televised address that he wouldn't tolerate the iraqi occupation of kuwait. the president said he hopes to free kuwait through economic pressure on saddam hussein, which continued to mount as the world's oil-consuming nations -- and, just as importantly, many of its leading oil producers -- joined together in a campaign to cut off iraqi oil without causing global economic dislocation. privately, u.s. officials say the estimates for the eventual u.s. commitment of troops, which began landing at saudi bases yesterday afternoon, go as high as 40,000, and would include a carefully-tailored mix of light and armored units that may have to remain there for weeks or months. if, as some industry and other officials believe, the captain demands that the saudis honor their contractual commitment to fill the tanker, the u.s. will have to decide whether to stop the giant ship, using the awesome combat power of the nearby carrier eisenhower and its twelve escort ships. the following afternoon, he and robert gates, the president's deputy advisor for national security paul wolfowitz, mr. cheney's top policy aide and gen. h. norman schwarzkopf, soon to become overall commander of the growing nucleus of u.s. forces, were aloft. by midnight, paratroopers of the ready brigade of the 82nd airborne division, the nation's most often-alerted unit, were lining up at pope air force base in fayetteville, n.c., to take their places on the hard, nylon-webbing seats in the transports that would carry them and their hastily-assembled gear on the long trip across the atlantic.
