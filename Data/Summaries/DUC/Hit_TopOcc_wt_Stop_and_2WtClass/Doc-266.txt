shining path rebels have formed a new front to push their insurgency into lima and other coastal urban areas, president alan garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded within blocks of the government palace. garcia spoke wednesday in an atmosphere of stepped up rebel attacks in lima and a series of weekend raids around the capital that resulted in the seizure of five shining path safe houses and 31 arrests. the maoist-inspired shining path operates in at least half of peru, especially in the mountains and jungle, but has had little success in expanding to coastal cities. the shining path draws much of its support from indigenous peoples resentful of the economic and political dominance in the country of 22 million of descendants of european immigrants. in one of the guerrilla safehouses raided in an upper-class lima suburb, police found tons of shining path documents and propaganda. garcia said he believed the raids proved that "the chief of terrorism actively participates" in shining path operations. operating out of its stronghold in ayacucho, the shining path has spread throughout peru's highlands since it launched its armed insurgency in may 1980.
