over the nra's opposition, congress and state legislatures have enacted legislation banning cop-killer bullets that penetrate protective vests, plastic guns that can be slipped past metal detectors and saturday night specials that are used in many crimes. at the same time, gun-control organizations are beginning to match the nra's mass mailings, ads and lobbying many schools are showing guns and the constitution, an anti-gun video produced by handgun control inc., whose chairwoman is sarah brady, wife of former white house press secretary james brady, who was disabled by gunfire in the 1981 assassination attempt on then-president reagan. but with opinion polls in both states showing that large majorities of residents support bans -- and with police complaining about being outgunned by criminals -- legislators have moved into action, spurring angry counterattacks from the nra. it was one of these red-alert warnings, written by nra lobbyist baker, that had been delivered to 100,000 gun owners in arizona and riled up the customers at the dealers outlet outside phoenix. finally, as nra washington lobbyist baker had done in his letter to arizona gun owners, hammer charged that a loosely worded definition in the florida bill would inadvertently ban all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. for instance, the day of the house subcommittee vote on assault weapons, she was outmaneuvered by bernard horn, the state legislative director for handgun control, who had flown in from washington. but dover, n.h., chief charles reynolds, president of the international assn. of chiefs of police, said that he and nra president joe foss recently agreed to keep the debate issue-oriented, without personal attacks.
