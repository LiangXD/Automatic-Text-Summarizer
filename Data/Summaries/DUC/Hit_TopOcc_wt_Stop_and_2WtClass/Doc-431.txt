he said she repeated cranston's contention that he had been very supportive of california thrifts and asked him if keating would raise money for the senator. he said he later persuaded keating to assist cranston by telling him that the senator shared his negative opinion of then-federal home loan bank board chairman edwin j. gray. it was the first of nearly $1 million that cranston solicited from keating -- $60,000 for his campaigns, $85,000 for the california democratic party and $850,000 for voter registration groups founded by the senator. he said that keating, who eventually developed a warm friendship with cranston, usually waited until the end of his meetings with the senator to discuss contributions. under questioning by special counsel robert s. bennett, grogan detailed the following occasions on which he said cranston or his aides allegedly sought contributions while at the same time pledging to assist keating with regulators: -- in late 1986, when the senate was considering legislation that would have imposed restraints on keating's management of lincoln, grogan tried to contact jordan, cranston's aide on the banking committee, for assistance in battling the proposal. keating asked cranston to contact then-bank board chairman m. danny wall on lincoln's behalf, and the senator agreed. -- in january, 1988, grogan, keating, cranston, cranston's son, kim, and kim's then-girlfriend, actress shelley duvall, had dinner together at jimmy's restaurant in los angeles. grogan said riegle, who was in line to become chairman of the senate banking committee, had also insisted he himself could not attend such a meeting with the regulators unless he was invited by mccain and deconcini, who represented the state where keating lived.
