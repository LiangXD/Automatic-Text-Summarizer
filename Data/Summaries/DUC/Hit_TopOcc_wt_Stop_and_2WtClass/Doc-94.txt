it boils down to regional politics, says arturo vargas, census-program director for the mexican american legal defense and educational fund, one of several hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants. counting illegal immigrants in 1990 is likely to mean one less seat in the house for pennsylvania and one more for california, according to the private population reference bureau. the census bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the immigration and naturalization service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in california. they fear that any attempt to ascertain the legal status of respondents will exacerbate difficulties the census bureau already faces in accurately counting hispanics and blacks. although the 106 million census forms can be reprinted if congress acts soon, wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge, mr. bonpanne says. the senate, by a vote of 58-41, added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract illegal immigrants when it comes up with figures used for reapportionment. because california, texas and other populous states that benefit from counting the illegal immigrants have such large delegations in the house, the house has always presented a bigger obstacle to the opponents of counting such immigrants.
