thomas' dramatic political and philosophical transformation reveals more about the man than does his horatio alger journey from rural southern poverty to supreme court nomination. racial anger, protest lyrics the homespun homilies of his grandfather, the ruler-slapping discipline of the nuns who taught him at a catholic school in segregated savannah, ga., the racial anger in the writings of richard wright and malcolm x, the iconoclastic theories of such academicians as thomas sowell and william barclay allen, even the protest lyrics of singer-songwriter nina simone -- all are parts of the story. as glimpsed in dozens of interviews and tens of thousands of pages of documents that thomas has turned over to the senate judiciary committee, these influences helped shape a set of beliefs that are now the subject of bitter controversy. thomas underscores his role as a minority figure within a minority by repeatedly quoting robert frost's poetic recollection: two roads diverged in a wood, and i -- i took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference. as a youth, clarence thomas shared the liberal attitudes of many bright young black people who were born into a segregated america and came of age after freedom rides, lunch room sit-ins and the 1964 civil rights act began erasing the overt signs of racial discrimination. as a holy cross college student in the turbulent 1960s, he joined black protesters, wore a beret and a leather jacket, and decorated his dormitory room with a poster of malcolm x. but thomas came to see his college years as wrongheaded. his philosophy by that point was that he felt that this country was affording people opportunities if they were willing to work and that to rely on government was in the nature of servitude, said lawyer harvey tettlebaum, who worked with thomas.
