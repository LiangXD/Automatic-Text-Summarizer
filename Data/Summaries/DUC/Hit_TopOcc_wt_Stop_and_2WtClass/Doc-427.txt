he simply turned lincoln, an institution whose financial health was questionable when he bought it, from a mortgage lender into a company that prepared raw land for residential construction, and he had a number of projects successfully built, he maintained. </p> <p> whatever the various government investigations ultimately disclose, it is already clear that lincoln is one of the worst disasters in the nationwide savings and loan debacle. </p> <p> began as lawyer </p> <p> keating, a collegiate gold medal swimmer in the pan american games and a navy fighter pilot in world war ii, began his business career as a lawyer in cincinnati. in 1979, lindner and keating consented to a securities and exchange commission order prohibiting them from fraudulently diverting corporate assets to their personal use. </p> <p> by the early 1980s, keating -- riding the tide of explosive growth in the sun belt -- had built the former lindner construction firm, renamed american continental corp., into one of the nation's 10 biggest home builders. </p> <p> moreover, he -- like others -- had noticed a new opportunity: congress, trying to rescue a savings and loan industry saddled with traditional low-rate, long-term home mortgage loans in an era of soaring interest rates, was dismantling the web of federal regulations that had always circumscribed the industry. </p> <p> under deregulation, banks and s&amp ls were allowed to place a part of their assets in direct investments such as ownership interests in real estate projects and other ventures, instead of just making loans on which they would collect interest. in 1983, the state allowed thrifts to put 100% of their money into direct investments. </p> <p> from his headquarters in phoenix, keating spotted a california thrift that seemed ideal for his expanding purposes. </p> <p> lincoln savings &amp loan was an orange county thrift that had experienced losses in the early 1980s, but it had returned to profitability by the end of 1983. about two-thirds of them were elderly southern californians who bought them at lincoln branch offices. </p> <p> some of them have said in lawsuits and congressional testimony that they were persuaded to buy the securities instead of certificates of deposit by american continental sales representatives, who assured them that the securities were safe. </p> <p> some have said they thought that the debentures were backed by federal deposit insurance -- a costly mistake, as things turned out. </p> <p> regulators cool </p> <p> by 1986, federal regulators in the regional office in san francisco were becoming distinctly unsympathetic to keating's operations. they concluded that keating was handling lincoln in an unsafe and unsound manner. </p> <p> in particular, examiners reported that lincoln had made a substantial number of loans without proper appraisals, without verification of borrowers' credit and even, in some cases, without a loan application. </p> <p> to a large extent, the examiners said in their reports, it appeared that lincoln was making bogus loans in an effort to get around the new restrictions on direct investments in real estate and to record profits that it had not really earned. </p> <p> many major loans were made to straw buyers: people who bought properties with lincoln funds on favorable terms and who never intended to repay the loans, thus leaving the savings and loan in control of the properties, the regulatory reports allege. </p> <p> the examiners said that, after making the loans, lincoln claimed as profits the up-front fees and interest such loans normally generate. they said that garcia, for instance, obtained a $30-million line of credit and that the $20.2 million he borrowed on the line was wired directly to the tucson electric power co., which owned 80% of the company garcia had founded in 1981. </p> <p> the hidden valley deal, they said, was not a condition for obtaining the line of credit, and garcia, a major developer, used his own funds to lend westcon the down payment. </p> <p> senators intervene </p> <p> it was during this period that one of the most controversial episodes in the lincoln case occurred. the phoenician opened in late 1988, and, although it is generating tremendous income -- $4.3 million last month alone -- it is not generating enough to pay off its construction debt, regulators claim. </p> <p> lincoln never was a viable institution under keating, said bert ely, an alexandria, va.-based consultant to the savings and loan industry. </p> <p> last week, government regulators seized control of the phoenician and another lincoln property, the crescent hotel in phoenix, ousting keating and as many as 30 of his associates from management of the lodges. </p> <p> seizure occurs </p> <p> the government finally seized lincoln on april 14, 1989, declaring that it was being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner and that keating and his executives were dissipating its assets. </p> <p> the day before lincoln was seized, american continental filed for protection from creditors in u.s. bankruptcy court in phoenix.
