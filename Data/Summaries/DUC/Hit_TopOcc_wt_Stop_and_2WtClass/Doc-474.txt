the reagan administration may be willing to relax its opposition to an increase in the minimum wage if congress agrees to dilute the legislation significantly, labor secretary william brock indicated. he also said that congress would have to drop plans to tie future rises in the minimum wage to the average wage for all non-supervisory private workers after 1990. but the administration will remain opposed to any broad minimum-wage boost that results in massive disemployment of young people, he added. this is the first indication that the administration would be willing to bend its staunch resistance to any increase in the minimum wage, which hasn't risen for six years. earlier this week, during the senate labor committee's first hearing on a bill to boost the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour in 1990 from the current $3.35, mr. brock reiterated his opposition to an increase. most house labor committee members oppose any youth subminimum wage, the small-business exemption has foundered in the past, and wage-indexing must stay in the bill, a staff official for the panel said. many people feel that some kind of increase in the minimum wage is inevitable, he said, so an effort is afoot to see how congress can do as little harm... and as much good as possible, while boosting the wage level.
