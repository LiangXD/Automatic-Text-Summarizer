he says the increase would affect the unemployment rate by less than one-tenth of a percentage point, and adds: estimates of dire consequences to the economy as a result of raising the minimum wage do not stand up to scrutiny. ronald sarasin, a lobbyist for the national restaurant association, acknowledges that we're going to survive even if the the wage is increased, but warns of the consequences for low-paid workers: this is less a business issue than a jobs issue. in 1981, the staff of the minimum wage study commission, which was appointed by president carter, estimated that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would trim teen-age employment demand by about 1%, and that rises in that wage have had little impact on overall unemployment. studies about whether minimum-wage increases hurt, or help, black workers are all over the lot, says university of michigan economist charles brown. opponents of raising the minimum wage insist that past increases have had a substantial effect in both layoffs and disemployment -- workers not hired who otherwise would have been. as a result of those conflicting pressures, labor secretary brock is trying to forge a compromise between the white house and congress, where the senate labor committee plans to act on a minimum-wage bill this fall, while the house committee plans further hearings. in return for administration agreement to raising the wage, mr. brock says, congress must also allow a youth differential wage that's lower than the minimum wage, so as not to discourage employers from hiring untrained new job entrants.
