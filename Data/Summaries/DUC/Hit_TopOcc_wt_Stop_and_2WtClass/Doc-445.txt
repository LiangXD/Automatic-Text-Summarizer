the five usgs scientists are among the few remaining people at clark air base, which was evacuated along with thousands of filipinos living near the volcano. the researchers, along with 10 filipino scientists and their equipment, today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches. (these volcanoes -- including mount lassen in the sierra nevada, and mount rainier and mount st. helens in the cascade range -- arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.) until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well. if it does have a massive eruption, pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path. the volcano's activity -- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, lipman said. but it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base.
