as the sense of change becomes palpable - with china's citic taking the british trading company jardine matheson's seat on the board of the powerful jockey club, and mandarin beginning to displace cantonese on the government radio - it is now up to china to decide how smooth the handover will be, and the shape of life beyond. 'while we are totally sincere in wanting to be co-operative and constructive, the nature of an enterprise as complicated as this makes it very difficult to see circumstances in which there are not going to be any more arguments,' says mr patten. after the dispute on electoral reform, beijing announced that it would dismiss the 1995 legco once china resumed sovereignty of hong kong, and replace it with a provisional legislature. the colonial government had planned to hand over by introducing a piece of midnight legislation to eliminate all references in hong kong law to institutions such as the governor and the queen. mr tsang, a member of the chinese government committee planning for the handover, says the provisional legislature will have full powers to make laws for an expected term of nine to 12 months. mr zhou nan, the most senior representative of the chinese communist party and government in hong kong, recently attacked mr patten's plans for a government-funded pension, saying: 'during the transition period, we should not casually transplant a costly euro-socialist pay-as-you-go concept to hong kong without prudently taking into consideration similar western programmes' long-standing track record of grossly under-estimating liabilities and grossly over-estimating funding projections.' mr patten claims that by 1997 public spending in hong kong as a percentage of gdp will be lower than it was in 1982 - the year britain began handover negotiations with china.
