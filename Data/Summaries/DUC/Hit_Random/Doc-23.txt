it is the practice of the protesters to go limp when ordered to move but to otherwise offer no resistance to police. the images of los angeles police swinging nightsticks at king as he lay on the ground, played repeatedly on national news programs, were burned into the national conscience and led to widespread calls for investigation of police brutality. shortly after rodney king's beating, a news program on abc illustrating police brutality showed a still photo of police using a martial-arts weapon against a person being arrested, but there was no mention that the episode involved operation rescue. similarly, the cbs evening news reported march 27 on various aspects of police brutality but did not include examples involving anti-abortion activists, a producer said. it (police abuse) has not attracted much attention because a lot of people are not sympathetic to operation rescue, said dr. james fyfe, a professor of justice at american university in washington, d.c. police may also have a predisposition to use excessive force against the anti-abortion activists, said fyfe, a former new york city policeman. colleen o'connor, the american civil liberties union's national public education director, and carol sobel, the aclu's senior staff counsel in los angeles, said they agree that police have abused operation rescue participants. critics of the commission's decision not to investigate say the issue was, and is, police brutality, not abortion.
