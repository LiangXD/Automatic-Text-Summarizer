it is infectious, invariably fatal and as insidious as termites, sometimes eating away brain cells for years without detection before a critical mass is spongified. spongiform research already has raised questions about a cornerstone of biology and spawned a nobel prize. spongiform research already has raised questions about a cornerstone of biology and spawned a nobel prize. he should know, having chased spongiform leads around the globe for 33 years and won a nobel prize in the process. based on the clues, dr. gajdusek, back at nih, led studies in the 1960s showing kuru, cjd and scrapie to be essentially the same infectious disease, studies that won the 1976 nobel prize for medicine. still, dr. brown and other scientists aren't much worried about mad cows because their animal studies show spongiform disease is very hard to transmit orally. still, dr. brown and other scientists aren't much worried about mad cows because their animal studies show spongiform disease is very hard to transmit orally.
