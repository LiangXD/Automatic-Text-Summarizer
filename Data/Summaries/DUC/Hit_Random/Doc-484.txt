how, indeed, are eight "biospherians" going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments, called biomes, as well as an intensive agricultural complex, to duplicate the earth's ecology? "they're so highly motivated in the first place, i would not be surprised to see the whole thing go through without a hitch, personnel-wise," said robert b. bechtel, an environmental psychologist at the university of arizona. "mine has always been that it's unlikely, because i think people tend to act as crews when they get in an experience that is prolonged," connors said. "let's just put it this way," ms. dyhr said, "there's nothing really that a corporation can do about what their employees do after 5 o'clock. "given the fact that various members of the clergy have shown themselves to be innovative and agreeable to doing marriages under very unusual circumstances, i'm sure that they could find a way to do it," ms. dyhr said. he and connors also said most studies of crews, including mixed-sex groups in environments far harsher and smaller than the biospherians are likely to encounter, have shown them to be highly motivated, energetic and willing to put up with almost anything for the sake of the project and the team's success. it's a kind of farming adventure."
