he said: 'because the major (diamond) producers freely consent to sell exclusively through one channel, the cso is able to preserve an orderly market by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand.' 'data accumulated independently of the cso would put botswana in a position to have more input into the arrangements for the sale of its diamonds,' idc pointed out. if botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth about usdollars 100m, independently of the cso - which sells about dollars 4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to market stability, idc said. other substantial producers such as the soviet union, angola, zaire and australia do not sell all their production to the cso and therefore have access to independent market information. however, in common with other producers selling diamonds to the cso, botswana has appointed independent valuers who continuously monitor diamond production and the prices paid. there has been a special relationship between the cso and botswana since 1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to de beers in exchange for an estimated usdollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the south african group. a delegation from botswana is to meet cso representatives in london at the end of this month for another attempt to break the deadlock.
