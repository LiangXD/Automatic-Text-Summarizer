hurricane specialist gil clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships. information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night. using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland, md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane. satellites can give a "pretty picture," he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path. "most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job," emmanuel said. forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise. forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
