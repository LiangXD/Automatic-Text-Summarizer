the effects of widespread drought on grain production in south africa could negate the expected recovery in economic growth in the second half of the year, mr kraai van niekerk, the country's agriculture minister, said yesterday. his predictions followed warnings on wednesday that drought in southern africa could cause famine in much of the region. the united nations food and agriculture organisation said hot and dry conditions in january and february were expected to reduce the total cereal harvest in 11 southern african countries to 16m tonnes, 25 per cent down on the average. it said zimbabwe and south africa, which normally offset shortages in the area with their own surpluses, would themselves have to import food. the fao said that as much as 2m tonnes of food aid could be needed for southern africa this year. logistical constraints could further exacerbate the problem, the fao said, with port handling capacities stretched by unprecedentedly large cereal imports and neighbouring countries sometimes competing for limited rail wagons. it said meeting food aid needs could be difficult as international attention was focused on emergencies in the former soviet union, eastern europe, iraq and the horn of africa.
