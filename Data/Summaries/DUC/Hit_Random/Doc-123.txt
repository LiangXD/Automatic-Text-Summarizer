much less known are his equally racist pronouncements denying black people, whether slave or free, specific constitutional protections enjoyed by whites. it was during this period that racial paranoia about black men with guns intensified. it was this change in the status of the black man, from slave to freeman, that caused racist elements in the country (north and south) to agitate for restrictions on guns -- ignoring long established customs and understanding of the second amendment. the specter of a black man with rights of a freeman, bearing arms, was too much for the early heirs of roger taney to bear. the 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution, along with the various reconstruction civil rights acts, prevented gun prohibitionists from making laws that were explicitly racist and that would overtly deny black people the right to bear arms. with the influx of large numbers of irish, italian and jewish immigrants into the country, gun laws now also targeted whites from the underprivileged classes of immigrants. of the 27,000 handgun carry permits in new york city, fewer than 2% are issued to blacks -- who live and work in high-crime areas and really are in need of protection.
