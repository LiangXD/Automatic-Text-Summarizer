sir, mr james skinner (letters, april 11) charges me with misuse of statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries. the limiting case is the international development association loans, 50-year loans, unindexed for inflation, at zero interest. to treat debt as necessarily burdensome also ignores the initial transfer of resources. this is like saying that banks, building societies, and governments issuing saving certificates are burdened when they pay interest. to harp on alleged external causes of third world poverty diverts attention from the real factors behind this poverty which are domestic, and thereby from the possibilities of addressing these. an arab-dominated sudanese government will not help the poorest blacks hundreds of miles away with whom it is in armed conflict the sinhalese government will not help the tamil poor, nor will the government of ethiopia the poor of tigre. encouraging third world countries to default inhibits the inflow of productive commercial capital, which, together with the skills that went with it, over the last 150 years transformed life in many poor countries, notably in south-east asia, west africa and latin america.
