the man president bill clinton has chosen to head the task force to help get his free trade pact with canada and mexico ratified may lack experience in international trade arenas. but he comes to washington well prepared for the kind of back-room political arm-twisting that will be required to persuade a divided congress to pass it. mr daley accepted the nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet position and turning down an offer to be mr clinton's chief negotiator at the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva. however, mr daley's appointment to chair the white house's task force on the north america free trade agreement is not a cosy political payoff. mr clinton himself reserved his support for the deal, negotiated under george bush's administration, until side agreements dealing with environmental and labour issues were reached last month. with the agreement fated to unravel if it is not ratified by january 1, the battle for congressional support will be fierce, fast, and visible. mr daley was chosen for the job, chicago observers say, because he has proven he can sway votes and is willing to take the risk of losing a controversial battle.
