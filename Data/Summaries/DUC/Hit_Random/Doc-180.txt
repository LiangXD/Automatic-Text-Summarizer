mark zimmer, a meterologist at the national hurricane center, reported an air force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at gilbert's center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. "that's the lowest pressure ever measured in the western hemisphere," zimmer said. the previous record low pressure of 26.35 inches was set by the 1935 labor day hurricane that struck the florida keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, he said. hurricane debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking mexico last month, was probably about half that size, moore said. category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometric pressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18 feet. category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to 155 mph, surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 27.17 to 27.90. the weakest hurricanes, category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of 74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more.
