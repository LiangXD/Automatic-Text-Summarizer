the war in the former republics of yugoslavia is forcing slovene enterprises to find alternative trading partners among european community countries as a means of compensating for lost markets in the region. however, slovene officials warn that capital inflows will not increase unless slovenia re-establishes trade links with its southern neighbours. until 1990, over 30 per cent of slovenia's exports were with the former yugoslavia, while about 70 per cent were divided between comecon, the now defunct socialist trading block, and western european countries. but following an embargo by serbia on slovene imports in 1990, and ensuing war in neighbouring croatia last year, slovene exports to the former yugoslavia have fallen to 15 per cent of that previously. the loss of markets in the former yugoslavia, and the war, has led to a sharp drop in industrial production, which last year fell by 15 per cent, and will fall a further 12 per cent this year. renault, french car manufacturer, which assembles cars in slovenia, and siemens, german-based mechanical and electrical goods maker, which has a joint venture with iskra, slovenia's electronic and telecommunications manufacturer, have used slovenia as a base for exporting to other parts of yugoslavia, as well as to western europe. in the meantime, slovene enterprises, particularly those in the furniture, electronics, paper, and white goods sector, are exporting to european community countries.
