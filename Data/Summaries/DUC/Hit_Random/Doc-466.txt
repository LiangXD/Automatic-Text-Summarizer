men who smoke heavily are nearly twice as likely as nonsmokers to die from a common form of leukemia, concludes a report by the university of edinburgh. the analysis, based on a previous study of 248,046 u.s. veterans, offers the firmest link yet between cigarette consumption and the disease. the report in tomorrow's british medical journal may well have an emotional impact on some people who are vacillating about quitting smoking and for one reason or another have a fear of leukemia, suggested nicholas wald, an epidemiologist at the medical college of st. bartholomew's hospital here. the balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia, dr. wald wrote in an accompanying commentary on the analysis, which was conducted by university of edinburgh epidemiologist leo kinlen. dr. kinlen found veterans who had smoked more than 21 cigarettes a day were the most likely to die from myeloid leukemia, the most common form of the disease in middle-aged people. previous studies have observed higher death rates from leukemia among smokers, but either involved fewer patients or didn't compare amounts smoked with incidence of the disease. an estimated 18,100 americans will die from it this year, making the disease the fifth-greatest cause of cancer deaths.
