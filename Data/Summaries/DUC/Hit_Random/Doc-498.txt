at the white house as elsewhere, vice president george bush's search for a running mate has people guessing _ and now one of their own is part of the guessing game. president reagan says he's just guessing along with everybody else. reagan also was asked about a newspaper column suggesting his national security adviser, lt. powell, stationed behind the group of reporters who were questioning reagan during an oval office photo opportunity, made no comment. later, as reagan bade farewell to visiting icelandic prime minister thorsteinn palsson in the white house east room, the question came up again. the questions about his future were spurred by a column in wednesday's washington post by william raspberry suggesting that it would be a "brilliant idea" for bush to pick powell as his running mate. powell is the only current white house aide being mentioned as even a remote possibility to be bush's running mate, although former chief of staff howard h. baker jr. has been reported under consideration.
