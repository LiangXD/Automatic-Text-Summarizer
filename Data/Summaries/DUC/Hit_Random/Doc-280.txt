(it is interesting to note, however, that hamilton was not discussing term limits on the legislature, and was actually arguing against the term limits on the chief executive that are contained now in the 22nd amendment.) even if seniority is a net cost in the aggregate, however, each district has an incentive to re-elect its own incumbent (and would if possible vote against the incumbents from other districts) because the representative's relative seniority translates into a large share of governmental largess. the voters would be better off if they could reach a binding agreement that precluded the re-election of incumbents, that is, if term limits were instituted. if a representative's power to favor his or her district did not vary with seniority, then voters would not have an excessive incentive to re-elect incumbents. voters do not have to worry that rejecting their incumbent puts them at a disadvantage relative to other voters' incumbents, so the electorate can properly weigh experience, fresh ideas, the value of rewarding satisfactory performance in office, and so on. the only defense for executive term limits is that the electorate needs to be protected against itself, an argument which, if true, would mean that democracy was seriously flawed and would work much less well than it seems to. the 22nd amendment reflected congress's desire to shift the balance of power away from the executive, and notably the desire of a republican-dominated house and senate to prevent the rise of another powerful democratic president like franklin roosevelt.
