critics of polygraph testing, who claim it's both unreliable and subject to potential abuse, are welcoming the restrictions. some critics of polygraph testing say a major problem with lie detectors is that a conscientious but easily upset truth teller could show the quickened pulse, faster breathing, increased blood pressure and skin reactions that a polygraph typically measures. polygraph testing and scoring methods currently used in personnel screening have never been shown to be valid tests of truthfulness, said john f. beary, an assistant dean at georgetown university school of medicine, in recent testimony before congress for the american medical association. mr. persaud alleges in an interview that the young woman examiner who gave him the first test for amerifirst made him angry by persistently asking questions about stealing and kickbacks by seeming incredulous when he said that he had no credit-card debt and a mortgage on only one of his three houses and by implying that he had earlier told her his name was george. testifying before congress in support of the bill, he alleged that the examiners pressured him into writing down any gossip he had heard about the conduct of other zale workers -- including drug use -- by telling him he would flunk the test and be fired if he didn't comply. the bill to ban most polygraph tests was widely backed by civil-liberties groups, labor unions and labor secretary ann mclaughlin, as well as by such organizations as the ama and the american psychological association. orrin hatch of utah, the committee's ranking republican, says 500,000 honest people each year are branded as liars by false lie-detector results.
