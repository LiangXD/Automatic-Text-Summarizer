britain and france were linked beneath the english channel on tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported. the conservative daily express newspaper noted in its wednesday editions that britons would theoretically be able to walk to france for the first time since the last ice age. "we see it as just another exercise, but i'm sure there will be a lot of parties going on," he said. another day will be needed to be certain, technicians said, but they called the line-up "exceptional," considering the massive boring machines are drilling holes about three stories high. a work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding more pay on the french side appeared likely monday to stall the linkup until the weekend or beyond. five british firms were ordered last wednesday to stand trial on charges related to the death of a construction worker last year. tunneling actually started in subsequent efforts in 1882 and 1974, but were abandoned.
