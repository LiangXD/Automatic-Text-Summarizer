aside from disarming the better half of iraq's million-man army that sits in and around kuwait, the american aim is to ensure that saddam hussein isn't allowed to frame the withdrawal of his troops as a political victory. patrick leahy (d., vt.), who last month opposed the congressional resolution authorizing war, said, i think that the president would make a terrible mistake if he allowed saddam hussein to be in the position where he could declare to his own people some sort of victory, and there is no sign president bush intends to do that. the huge allied armored corps north and west of the guard is the biggest combat tank force assembled since world war ii, with more than 1,300 heavy tanks and about 100,000 u.s. and british soldiers, supported by hundreds of apache helicopters and a-10 jets. according to preliminary reports from the front, one pentagon official said, it appeared that the guard maintained discipline and that companysize units weren't abandoning the battlefield without orders. he also didn't appear to entirely give up his claim to kuwait as a province of iraq, saying that the country was annexed on aug. secondly, the u.s. is calculating that saddam hussein will remain a sympathetic figure to those who revere him no matter how the u.s. treats him -- and that those who are skeptical about him will become more so. secondly, the u.s. is calculating that saddam hussein will remain a sympathetic figure to those who revere him no matter how the u.s. treats him -- and that those who are skeptical about him will become more so.
