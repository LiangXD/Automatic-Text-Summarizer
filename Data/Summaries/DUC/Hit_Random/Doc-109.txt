actress elizabeth taylor, hospitalized with pneumonia, was listed as stable thursday at st. john's hospital and health center, her publicist said. "she is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized," dr. patricia murray, an infectious disease specialist treating miss taylor, said in a statement tuesday. miss taylor said in the statement: "i have been advised by my physician to remain hospitalized and i expect to make a full recovery." the actress had a nearly fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, the year she won an oscar for "butterfield 8." doctors performed a tracheotomy _ inserting an air tube in her windpipe at the neck _ to help her breathe. miss taylor's health problems started with a fall from a horse when she was 13 and filming the movie "national velvet." in 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and pain killers prescribed for a wide range of health problems.
