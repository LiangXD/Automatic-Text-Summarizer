based on the new findings, mr. gray predicted earlier this summer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be above average, and so far he seems to be right. in july he said there would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of which six would be hurricanes. the national hurricane center said that as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this year, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal. weather researchers have been seeking to predict hurricane patterns more accurately as an early warning for coastal residents of the u.s. and the caribbean. a sharp decrease in hurricane activity over the past two decades spurred business and residential development that would be vulnerable to increased hurricane activity. mr. gray said his research, published in the current issue of science, suggests that intense caribbean hurricanes gilbert, joan and hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of this change. from 1947 to 1969, for instance, rainfall in the western sahel was especially abundant, and during this time there were 13 severe hurricanes that formed in the atlantic ocean.
