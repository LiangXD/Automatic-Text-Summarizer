mr chris patten, hong kong's governor, yesterday gave china until the end of the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of hong kong. mr patten said that they had agreed the best forum for settlement was the airport committee of the anglo-chinese joint liaison group - a place where consensus has been stalled for months. he said the legislative timetable demanded that bills be put before the legislative council (legco), the colony's unicameral legislature, early in the new year to give effect to the planned changes for the 1994 and 1995 elections. although mr patten did not say so yesterday, he has suggested in the past that he would be prepared to introduce his proposals for a slightly faster pace of democratic development in hong kong without china's approval. he went out of his way, however, to praise lu - the man who holds day-to-day responsibility for ensuring a smooth transfer of sovereignty over hong kong in 1997. he went out of his way, however, to praise lu - the man who holds day-to-day responsibility for ensuring a smooth transfer of sovereignty over hong kong in 1997. 'i am bound to say i don't think this answers some of the problems i have to disentangle before the end of this year,' the governor said.
