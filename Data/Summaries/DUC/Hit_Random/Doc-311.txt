mr. marshall refused, explaining that there were other cases pending on variations and interpretations of miranda and that, if confirmed to the supreme court, he would have to rule on those cases: on decisions that are certain to be re-examined in the court, it would be improper for me to comment on them in advance.... ervin, exasperated, pointed out that since the jurisdiction of the supreme court is so broad that a case on practically any issue might come before it, mr. marshall's theory meant that the committee would have a difficult time asking any questions about mr. marshall's judicial philosophy. but such personal experiences are irrelevant to the work of a justice of the supreme court, according to thurgood marshall. there is nothing personal allowed, nothing personal, mr. marshall emphasized. justices shall not use their personal views, and indeed, they take an oath not to do so. clearly a senator may vote any way he wishes on a nomination, and for any reason but not all votes nor all reasons are consistent with the duties of senators, and with the manner in which they ought to behave. the fact that mr. thomas's judicial views are not the same as those of thurgood marshall is a reflection of the increasingly pluralistic nature of black society, but hardly an issue worthy of senatorial consideration.
