some 7.2 million employers nationwide will be required to put up posters in december summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions and outlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detector test. in addition to the fines, anyone required to take the test in violation of the new law can sue employers in federal and state courts for relief, such as employment reinstatement, promotion and any payment of lost wages and benefits. exempted from protection under the ban are employees of federal, state and local governments or of federal contractors engaged in national security, intelligence or top secret activities. also exempted from the ban are prospective employees of armored car, security alarm and security guard firms hired to protect operations affecting health and safety, national security or money. but any workers asked to submit to a polygraph exam under those conditions must be given at least 48 hours advance notice and a statement in advance telling them of their rights, including the right to refuse the test or to terminate it at any time. the pre-test statement also must explain the specific incident or activity being investigated and the basis for the employer's suspicion that the person asked to take the exam was involved in it. the regulations also forbid disclosure of the test results to anyone other than the employee without the employee's consent or a court order.
