mad cow disease has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or bse, was diagnosed only in 1986. i think it is a recognition -- not just of pressure from farmers -- but that the public would feel more confident that no bse-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100% compensation, said sir simon gourlay, president of the national farmers union. because of the disease, the u.s. department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service in july banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from britain, said margaret webb, a usda spokeswoman in washington. there is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as creutzfeldt-jakob disease. about two dozen cases were reported in britain last year. according to a report in the british medical journal, the incidence of creutzfeldt-jakob disease is no higher in britain than it is in countries free of scrapie.
