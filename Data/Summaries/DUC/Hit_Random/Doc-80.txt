at the pentagon, spokesman pete williams said the number of u.s. aircraft accidents in the gulf - including three separate crashes this week - were not out of the ordinary. williams said the air force gave its pilots in the gulf "safety awareness" briefings during the flight ban in order "to review what they need to do to fly more safely." williams said information about the number of flight hours in desert shield is classified and will not be disclosed. the toll for accidental deaths since operation desert shield began rose to 31 on wednesday when an air force f-111 fighter-bomber crashed on a training mission in saudi arabia, killing both crew members. williams said the air force was the only service that has taken special measures to review safety in the gulf since this week's accidents. "given the amount of flying that has to be done, given the extraordinary circumstances and given the higher than ordinary operating tempo in the area, i think our service people are doing very well, but any accident is cause for concern," he said. five u.s. aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in the gulf area since the start of desert shield two months ago: an f-111, an f-4 phantom reconnaissance jet, an f-15e and two marine corps uh-1 huey helicopters.
