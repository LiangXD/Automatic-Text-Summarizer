he had decided he could not comply with requirements of a consulting job he had accepted from the agency for international development, and he was scrambling to come up with a suitable substitute. hatch, a one-time peace corps volunteer with a doctorate in economic development, is founder and president of the non-profit foundation for international community assistance, which recently moved its headquarters from tucson to alexandria, va. "we teach severely poor mothers how to create their own self-managed bank, which provides them with self-employment loans, provides them with savings incentives and provides them with a support group of mothers like themselves, so that they are all attacking change at the same time." catholic relief services entered a five-year, $1 million joint venture a year ago with the u.s. agency for international development and the foundation to create 40 village banks in thailand. their vehicle for improvement is the village bank, each comprised of 30 to 50 women who, through loans starting at $50, can earn enough to provide savings and create capital. "fifty percent or more are illiterate, and i would say 90 percent of them don't have any idea of what they're getting into when we start out," says hatch. the foundation has major proposals pending with the agency for international development, the ford foundation, citibank and the chase manhattan bank, among others.
