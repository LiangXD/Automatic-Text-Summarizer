hugo, which caused an unprecedented $10 billion in damage, killed 28 people in the lesser antilles islands and an additional 29 in south carolina. 30, sheets and other hurricane experts are using hugo's example to get the attention of complacent coastal residents who've never experienced such fury. "we'll take advantage of the fact that there was a hugo last year and raise people's awareness," said sheets. early warnings about hugo last september allowed 350,000 people to evacuate safely, and in south carolina the worst of the hurricane struck the francis marion national forest between charleston and myrtle beach, sheets said. if hugo had struck a major coastal population center, the destruction would have been greater than most americans have ever seen, according to computer simulations known as slosh models, for sea, lake and overland surges from hurricanes. "compare that situation to the miami-through-palm beach area _ all of dade, broward and palm beach counties would have been... destroyed." the names for atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms this year are: arthur, bertha, cesar, diana, edouard, fran, gustav, hortense, isidore, josephine, klaus, lili, marco, nana, omar, paloma, rene, sally, teddy, vicky and wilfred.
