while i don't know that he's a great strategist, he more than makes up for it with common sense and getting the right people together at the right time and resolving problems before they happen. secretary of state george shultz and frank carlucci, the current national security adviser and mr. reagan's nominee to become secretary of defense, are both better known in congress and will be more visible, selling the pending arms-control treaty and other administration policies. gen. powell, a genial and plain-spoken 50-year-old, is one of a special breed of washington figures: he is well known within the tightly knit national security establishment, yet largely unknown to the rest of the nation. he has been a senior aide under three cabinet officers -- mr. weinberger, former defense secretary harold brown and former energy secretary charles duncan -- and has known mr. carlucci since working under him in the office of management and budget 15 years ago. gen. powell also has shown that he can present issues to his boss without seeming to impose his own views -- a skill useful in maintaining the image of honest broker of ideas important for a national security adviser. colin is the consummate staff man, says lawrence korb, a former assistant defense secretary. it isn't a term a grandiloquent national security adviser like henry kissinger would have used, but it's an indicator of the kind of efficient and noncontroversial nsc operation gen. powell can be expected to run.
