the government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. because of the disease, the u.s. department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from great britain in july, said margaret webb, a usda spokeswoman in washington. the government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease. a commission chaired by professor sir richard southwood of oxford university reported last year that the cause of bse "is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses." the report said the disease was impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it did not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies. about two dozen cases were reported in britain last year. "it is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of bse on human health," a consultative committee reported to the agriculture ministry.
