he told the national governors' association that he was committed to 'ending welfare as we know it' with measures to finance expanded job training for the unemployed, matched by a requirement that people must do some kind of work for their welfare cheque. the president said he would focus on better implementation of the family support act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an nga task-force which he, as governor of arkansas, co-chaired. advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the new administration's intentions, fearing that the centrist democratic emphasis on requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fall prey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding of existing programmes. with the onset of the recession, state revenues have been constrained while the number of welfare recipients has grown by 30 per cent. as a result, few states have been able to implement in full the act's requirement that welfare recipients take part in some form of education or training. but at the same time people must be helped out of the welfare trap by providing them with continued health coverage, child care, and expanded earned income tax credits when they took jobs. many states have already embarked on far-reaching welfare reform programmes, such as michigan's 21-point plan to strengthen families or new jersey's family development programme.
