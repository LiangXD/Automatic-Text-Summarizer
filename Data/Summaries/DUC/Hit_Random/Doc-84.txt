drugs are now available that can put aids patients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a vaccine to protect against aids infection is possible, a panel of aids experts said saturday. "we have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing remission," said william haseltine of the dana-farber cancer institute in boston. a number of treatments for aids and aids-related infections are available, he said, but many of them are not available to the poor or to developing countries. "i think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to the general population," vermund said. many of the cases of tuberculosis are occurring when individuals who were exposed to tuberculosis early in life contract aids. they lose the ability to continue suppressing the tuberculosis bacteria, which normally would have remained dormant, and tuberculosis appears. there is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have aids, but that is likely, vermund said.
