bank of boston corp.'s decision to treat its third world loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions, bankers and analysts say. it's a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out, says lawrence cohn, an analyst at merrill lynch &amp co. the bank of boston decision may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks, adds james j. mcdermott, jr., director of research at keefe bruyette &amp woods inc., a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks. for instance, if manufacturers hanover corp. imitated bank of boston's action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, keefe bruyette estimates. in order to take steps similar to bank of boston's, large money-center banks would have to sell assets, shrink balance sheets and slash dividends -- and they show little sign of doing that. mellon bank corp. said yesterday that it expects a fourth-quarter loss of about $220 million, and that it would increase loan-loss reserves by about $180 million to cover troubled foreign loans. chase manhattan skidded $2.25 to close at $20.125, manufacturers hanover fell $2.375 to $24.25, and j.p. morgan &amp co. was off $1.50 to $30. bank of boston announced monday that it was writing off $200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the third world on a non-accrual basis.
