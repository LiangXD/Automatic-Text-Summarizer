the length of this period of totality, as it's known, will depend on where viewers are along the path. the eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of tuxpan, on mexico's west coast. bob bruynesteyn, head of the san mateo astronomical society, puts it succinctly: not too many people have stood in the shadow of the moon. from the border to the northern edge of where the eclipse will be total is about a 16-hour drive, said raul cardenas, the mexican consul in san jose. they've had to get flights into somewhere else, like honolulu, and do a short hop to where they want to be. if you're interested an eight-page brochure on the july 11 eclipse is available for $2 from the astronomical society of the pacific, 390 ashton ave., san francisco, ca 94112. if you're interested an eight-page brochure on the july 11 eclipse is available for $2 from the astronomical society of the pacific, 390 ashton ave., san francisco, ca 94112.
