the government of the northern republic of slovenia said friday that serbia, in the south and east, is attempting to "oust us from yugoslavia." but the serbian action tuesday was the gravest threat to the unity of the yugoslav federation since the death of the nation's post-world war ii leader josip broz tito in 1980. earlier friday 13 people were arrested when police dispersed a crowd of about 100 gathered for a pro-serbian rally in ljubljana that had been prohibited by slovenian authorities. "we shall never permit anyone to drive us away or oust us from yugoslavia," it said. it denounced the serbian communist leadership, saying, "we do not accept a comprehensive control of a single truth, of political uniformity, authoritarianism and intolerance, of ideologic monolithism." slovenian officials said the rally had been organized by serbian politicians trying to oust the slovenian leadership. the serbian news media on friday accused slovenia of "fascist-like" behavior and called for the resignation of yugoslav president janez drnovsek, a slovene.
