less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed colombia to the brink of political chaos. addressing president virgilio barco, the el tiempo editorial said: "in your hands, and only in your hands, is the power to avoid the country's dissolution." "the gravest aspect of colombia's bloodletting is that the government has no idea how to even slow it," said a member of a regional human rights committee based in medellin, the cocaine capital. bombings by the medellin cartel have caused millions of dollars in property damage, led to the militarization of medellin and other cities and shattered the nerves of citizens. several politicians and analysts said an armed assassin could not have been aboard a jetliner without the complicity of government and airport security personnel. continuing to focus on a military solution to colombia's problems, barco said late friday he would double the size of a 3,000-man anti-terrorist police unit. the unit achieved its greatest success against drug traffickers when it killed a medellin cartel leader, gonzalo rodriguez gacha, in a gunfight last december.
