if convicted on the racketeering charges, the three could face an astronomical amount in financial penalties: the indictment asks that they forfeit a total of $1.85 billion, representing their salaries, other compensation and their share of drexel profits, all earned in what the government charges was a continuing criminal enterprise operated at the new york-based investment banking firm. he is also named as a defendant in an indictment returned last july relating to princeton/newport partners, a small investment firm that did business with drexel. the second broad area involves transactions with princeton/newport partners, in which drexel and milken allegedly helped princeton/newport carry out tax fraud through sham securities trades with drexel. the third general area involves alleged straight insider trading in the securities of lorimar inc. and viacom inc. by michael milken. drexel's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges pending against the firm calls for it to withhold nearly all of michael milken's compensation from 1988, as well as about $13 million owed to lowell milken. but the brothers are challenging that in court as a violation of their constitutional rights, and it will be up to a federal judge to decide. instead, they will be allowed to present themselves for arraignment, probably one week from today.
