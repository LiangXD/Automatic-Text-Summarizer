damage caused by hurricane andrew could rise to dollars 20bn, it was estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest us storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of new orleans. the hurricane tore through southern florida early on monday morning, causing billions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterday was moving north-west across the gulf of mexico with winds of about 140 miles an hour. ms kate hale, director of emergency services in florida's dade county, which bore the brunt of the storm, estimated that andrew had already caused dollars 15bn to dollars 20bn (pounds 7.5bn-pounds 10bn) of damage. however, insurance industry analysts cautioned that it was too early to assess the costs accurately. several forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in central louisiana, to the west of new orleans, possibly late last night or this morning. the brunt of insurance claims from the florida storm will fall on the us industry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the state farm group and the allstate insurance unit of sears roebuck. the last serious us hurricane, hugo, which struck south carolina in 1989, cost the industry dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of the total damage caused ranged between dollars 6bn and dollars 10bn.
