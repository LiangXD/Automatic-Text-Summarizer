the same situation applies if your boss has a polygraph examiner come into the warehouse tomorrow to hook wires to randomly selected employees and question them about merchandise missing from the company's shelves. it is now illegal across america for most employers in interstate commerce to use the controversial polygraph for pre-employment screening purposes or to use them randomly against workers already on their payroll. these restrictions on lie detectors, whose accuracy has long been under attack, are enumerated in a federal law that took effect tuesday, six months after it was signed by president reagan. not covered by the new rules, however, are federal, state and local governments and firms doing sensitive work under contract to the defense department, fbi and cia. an employer can request an employee to take a lie detector test if the worker had access to missing or damaged material and if the employer sets forth in a written statement a reasonable suspicion that the worker was involved in the loss. any such polygraph exam would have to be conducted under strict conditions, with no questions about personal beliefs and sexual behavior, and the exam results alone could not be used as a basis for discipline or a refusal to hire. she said the law would have the greatest impact in alabama, arizona, arkansas, colorado, florida, georgia, illinois, indiana, kansas, kentucky, louisiana, mississippi, missouri, nevada, new hampshire, new mexico, new york, north carolina, north dakota, ohio, oklahoma, south carolina, south dakota, tennessee, texas, utah, virginia and wyoming.
