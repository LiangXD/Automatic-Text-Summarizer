rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six western states, and a new mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long-handled nets. officials said 566 gila trout were fished out of diamond creek in southwestern new mexico, put in containers on mules and horses, loaded onto trucks and brought to the mescalero fish hatchery. "they were in good shape," said toby martinez, a u.s. forest service range and wildlife staff officer for the gila national forest. much of the creek was contaminated by ash from the lightning-caused divide fire, which started june 30 and burned about 10,000 acres 150 miles southwest of albuquerque, said forest service spokeswoman andrea garcia. arizona firefighters mopped up hot spots in several small fires, and only one blaze in the state was not fully contained. the fire, which raged for four days and destroyed 14 unoccupied structures, was contained wednesday and officials predicted it would be controlled soon. heninger said four crews will probably be released from the fire today, leaving two to continue mop-up work.
