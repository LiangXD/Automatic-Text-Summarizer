elizabeth taylor has rallied from a near-fatal bout with pneumonia _ and even joked about coming out in her "balcony attire" to wave to reporters _ but is "not out of the woods," doctors say. the 58-year-old actress was taken off the ventilator that had aided her breathing for several days and was smiling again and "very happy the tube was out," said dr. patricia murray, an infectious disease specialist. "she said she'd come out and wave to you but she's not in her balcony attire," the doctor said. she had to undergo a tracheotomy during a bout with pneumonia in 1961 that nearly killed her. in response to persistent rumors about aids and other illnesses, weintraub said there was "no suggestion of either cancer or infections commonly seen in aids." with her were her four children from three marriages, maria burton-carson, liza todd-tivey and christopher and michael wilding. with her were her four children from three marriages, maria burton-carson, liza todd-tivey and christopher and michael wilding.
