some of this year's drought in the midwest may have been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equator in the pacific ocean, according to a new computer study reported thursday. they noted that when asked what caused the drought that hit much of north america in 1988, meteorologists often reply "the jet stream was displaced northward of its usual position so that storms, which tend to track along the path of the jet stream, were similarly displaced northward." by july the weather pattern they studied was breaking up, and continuing dryness in the study area and elsewhere probably had other causes, arkin said. but during the april-june period there were alternating high and low pressure centers across much of the northern half of the western hemisphere: a high-pressure center north of hawaii, a low in the gulf of alaska, a high in central canada extending down into the northern great plains states and a low on the east coast. in this period, pacific ocean temperatures ranged up to 5.4 degrees fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about 4,000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of south america, with the coolest spot midway along the band. at the same time, a bit to the north of this band, surface temperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal. the below-normal equatorial temperature by itself did not give such a result.
