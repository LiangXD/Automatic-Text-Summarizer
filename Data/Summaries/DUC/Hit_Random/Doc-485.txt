botanist linda leigh, who has spent the last three weeks literally in her element, called her stay in an experimental biosphere a success wednesday but said she's ready to return to earth. when ms. leigh exits thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days inside an airtight, 17,000-cubic foot glass-and-steel structure, she will have been the longest inhabitant of a completely enclosed ecosystem, with air and water generated and recycled independently of earth's. "the one thing that i really do miss is just companionship," ms. leigh said wednesday in a telephone interview from within the module, located on a ranch about 30 miles north of tucson. "i don't think that it's a matter of feeling lonely, but there's just something about direct human contact and sitting with somebody and pouring them a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and having that morning discussion it's very different than doing it over the phone or over the video," she said. i feel like i could stay in here indefinitely." three daily medical checks, including pulse at rest and after exercise, blood pressure, pulmonary function, blood oxygen saturation and urine tests, have shown her health is "unbelievably positive. samples are passed through a special port for outside analysis, along with samples of waste water and her urine.
