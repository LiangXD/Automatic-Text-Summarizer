george bush, by contrast, developed a coherent strategy to liberate kuwait backed up his diplomacy with a war plan that provided for sufficient force to achieve a clear military objective obtained at every step the endorsement not only of america's allies but -- miraculously -- also of the u.n. security council secured public support at home and the consent of a divided, reluctant congress wisely left military campaigns and tactics to his commanders and fended off a last minute attempt by mikhail gorbachev to turn iraq into a soviet protectorate. in an hour-long speech on march 16, he praised political pluralism, democracy and iraq's future contribution to stability in the middle east. he was appealing, it seems, to washington's interest in some balance among iran, iraq and syria to ankara's concern about turmoil on turkey's southern border and perhaps to friendly german arms merchants who would again want to do business with him. even though the bush administration's response to the new challenge has been mysteriously slow and inept, saddam hussein's most recent depredations have killed his last chance to plead for magnanimity in victory, or to posture himself as the lesser evil, who would, at least, give us the blessings of stability in iraq. and once iraq is permitted to resume oil exports, it must contribute part of its earnings to a u.n.-administered fund for reparations to kuwait and other victims of its aggression. when saddam hussein is told to hand to the u.n. a list of all his prohibited weapons as a first step in complying with the ceasefire, he might well respond by arguing: (1) iraq never had any of these weapons, (2) if it had, american bombing raids have destroyed every one of them, and (3) if there were remaining weapons, all records have been burned by kurdish terrorists. the u.s. is committed to support the u.n., and the u.n. is now committed to inserting itself deeply into the internal affairs of iraq.
