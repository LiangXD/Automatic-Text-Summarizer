shining path rebels have formed a new front to push their insurgency into lima and other coastal urban areas, president alan garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded within blocks of the government palace. garcia spoke wednesday in an atmosphere of stepped up rebel attacks in lima and a series of weekend raids around the capital that resulted in the seizure of five shining path safe houses and 31 arrests. the shining path has called on voters to boycott sunday's vote and threatened election day "armed strikes" in andean cities. in one of the guerrilla safehouses raided in an upper-class lima suburb, police found tons of shining path documents and propaganda. the raids also proved that the new urban front has been formed, garcia said: "the people who were captured were essential to the new movement." two people were injured in the car bombings near the government palace on tuesday night and wednesday and garcia called the upsurge in urban violence a "desperate response" to the weekend raids. in other violence wednesday in lima, a city of 6 million, four rebels armed with machine guns took over a neighborhood electoral office.
