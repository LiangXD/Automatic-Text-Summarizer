two germans still are held in lebanon, however, and u.n. secretary-general javier perez de cuellar said his work would not be over until they are released. eight other westerners have been freed since august, when the united nations launched negotiations involving a complex swap of western hostages, hundreds of arabs held by israel, and information about missing israelis. in exchange for the hostage releases, the kidnappers were reported by iran's tehran radio this week to have been promised that they would not be pursued by the united states, germany or any other country. confusion about anderson's whereabouts arose after a five-page arabic-language statement from the islamic jihad group that held anderson announced today he would be set free, but its wording was unclear as to whether he had already been released. american, syrian and lebanese officials initially said anderson had been freed and turned over to syrian troops in lebanon. the syrians said anderson would be handed over to u.s. ambassador christopher ross at the foreign ministry. the hostage-holders have in the past few years been isolated by the desire of syria and iran to improve ties with the west.
