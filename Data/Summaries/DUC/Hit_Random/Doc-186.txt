the probability of more intense hurricanes in the atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s, says meteorologist william m. gray of colorado state university, who analyzes hurricane patterns. the well-watered conditions in the '50s and '60s produced 31 of the most severe kind (categories 4 and 5) in the 17-year period 1950 to 1967. last year's gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across jamaica and the mexican yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the western hemisphere. this september's hugo, which ripped through the virgin islands and puerto rico before clobbering south carolina, had sustained winds of 150 m.p.h. and an atmospheric pressure of 918 millibars (27.1 inches). 5 hurricanes have struck the united states with full force, the 1935 labor day storm that ravaged the florida keys and 1969's camille, which slammed ashore at mississippi and louisiana. in 1980, allen, the mightiest caribbean storm then recorded, had lost much of its punch before it hit the gulf coast of texas. the threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded, says meteorologist kerry emanuel of the massachusetts institute of technology.
