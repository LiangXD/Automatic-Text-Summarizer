a minimum wage is a convenient and effortless way for a left-of-centre government to appear to be doing something about the problems of poverty, public sector pay and the growth of unskilled employment. its unemployment rate rose from 11.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent between 1974 and 1983, of which over one third is estimated to be a direct result of the rise in the minimum wage. yet a number of recent empirical studies of the effect of last year's rise in the us minimum wage fail to support this traditional view. there are many outliers but the upward sloping 'best-fit' line between the dots indicates a positive, and statistically significant, relationship between higher mandated wage growth and higher employment. one explanation is that fast-food restaurants can impose below-market wages on their existing employees but have to raise them to market rates in order to attract new employees. only when the government mandates this general wage increase does expansion become profitable. but the result is not more skilled employment, as labour would have us believe.
