the acne drug is believed to trigger these immature but malignant cells to divide and mature and then die essentially a natural death. the drug used in the experimental treatment is known as tretinoin, which belongs to a class of chemicals called retinoic acids that are related to vitamin a. it is an uncommon cancer, afflicting about 1,000 americans a year, in which certain cells in the bone marrow become malignant before they have matured into fully functioning white blood cells. the malignant, immature white cells (known as myelocytes) flood the blood stream, producing fatigue, fever, weight loss and bleeding. until now, chemotherapy with standard anti-cancer drugs has been the only effective treatment for acute promyelocyltic leukemia, but it produces cures in only about a third of patients. the tip-off that an tretinoin-like drug might be effective in treating the leukemia came from a genetic finding, dr. raymond p. warrell jr. of memorial sloan-kettering and his colleagues in new york and at m.d. anderson cancer center in houston reported in this week's new england journal of medicine. this and other laboratory findings suggested that the immaturity of the leukemic white blood cells might somehow be related to a foul-up in the way the cells handled or failed to handle retinoic acid.
