three hours of steady rain monday afternoon provided a much-needed edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared 1,650 acres in shoshone national forest in wyoming, and rainfall in neighboring yellowstone national park calmed three smaller fires there. meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze that raged across 2,200 acres near yosemite national park in california over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-day fire in michigan's hiawatha national forest under control monday after the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres. four 20-person firefighting crews from colorado, utah and south dakota were expected to arrive at the fire by monday night, putting the total number of firefighters at about 430. meanwhile at yellowstone, park spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said that because the three fires there all were in the backcountry, no firefighters were trying to douse the flames. because of the fires, park officials sunday had closed off some areas, but vanderbilt said monday the rain had allowed the reopening of the areas to hiking and camping. firefighters, aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity, reported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained monday afternoon and hoped to have a line surrounding the fire early tuesday morning, hale said. bluedorn said continued hot, dry weather means it could be weeks before the fire is extinguished.
