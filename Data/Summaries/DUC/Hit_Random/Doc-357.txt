the president ordered a cease-fire -- but a temporary one, contingent on iraq's freeing its captives, complying with united nations resolutions and taking other steps to help defuse the region. u.s. policy makers are talking tentatively of securing kuwait with demilitarized zones and an islamic peacekeeping force drawn largely from persian gulf states and egypt. at this point, making it very clear saddam hussein has been defeated and there are no illusions about it is good -- provided that we know how to play the next phase, said william quandt, a former national security council middle east analyst now with the brookings institution. in that way, u.s. troops could withdraw quickly from the slice of southern iraq that they have swept through in their attacks on the republican guard. this particularly enhances the position of egyptian president hosni mubarak and saudi king fahd, who gambled that they could defy iraq and rely on the u.s. to stand with them -- and who now can claim that their gamble paid off handsomely. for starters, there's likely to be new resistance in israel, where some are already asking what this war would have been like with a pro-iraqi palestinian state next door. tehran will insist on being a part of any new persian gulf security system, and may use its influence within it to agitate for expelling any western forces from the region.
