firefighters in california, michigan, montana, wyoming and utah battled holiday weekend fires which blackened more than 6,000 acres of forest and wilderness areas. the fire, which began saturday, was declared contained this morning, "we have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket," said mary hale, a spokeswoman for the california department of forestry. a four-day fire in 1,100 acres of hiawatha national park in the upper peninsula of michigan was also said to be under control, although continued hot dry weather could mean weeks before the fire is extinguished. a small contingent of firefighters who hiked into the absaroka-beartooth wilderness on monday in south-central montana contained portions of a 2,000-acre fire that has been burning there since june 19, forest officials said. phil jaquith, beartooth district ranger for the custer national forest, said the bulk of the fire on the east banks of the stillwater river was not being suppressed. three-quarters of an inch of rain on monday helped slow a fire on 1,650 acres in the shoshone national forest in wyoming, and rain also damped fires in yellowstone national park. meanwhile, a fire which burned 8,700 acres in the tonto national forest north of phoenix, ariz., was reported extinguished on monday.
