us insurers expect to pay out an estimated dollars 7.3bn (pounds 3.7bn) in florida as a result of hurricane andrew - by far the costliest disaster the industry has ever faced. in the battered region it is estimated that 275,000 people still have no electricity and at least 150,000 are either homeless or are living amid ruins. although there had already been some preliminary guesses at the level of insurance claims, yesterday's figure comes from the property claims services division of the american insurance services group, the property-casualty insurers' trade association. yesterday's estimate does not include any projection for claims in louisiana, which was also affected by the storm, although less severely than florida. an estimate of the insured losses in this second state will be released later this week. by contrast, insurance claims resulting from the los angeles riots earlier this year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the us - totalled just dollars 775m. this easily exceeds the record dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in 1989, when the industry paid out on both hurricane hugo and the loma prieta earthquake in california.
