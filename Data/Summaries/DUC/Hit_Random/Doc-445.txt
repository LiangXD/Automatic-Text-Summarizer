even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, lipman said. pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as mount st. helens did when it erupted in 1980. if it does have a massive eruption, pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path. in the worst case, a really big eruption, all of clark air force base could be covered with glowing ash, lipman said. the volcano's activity -- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, lipman said. no reputable scientist i know of is drawing a connection between the two, lipman said. no reputable scientist i know of is drawing a connection between the two, lipman said.
