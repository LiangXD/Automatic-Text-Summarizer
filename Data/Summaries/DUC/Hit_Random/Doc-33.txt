that the los angeles police department should have been overwhelmed by the riots may be understandable, but it represents one final blot on mr gates's reputation. shortly after his appointment in 1978, mr gates told a hispanic audience that hispanic officers were not promoted because they were lazy, and he later suggested that the carotid choke hold - a police technique severely curbed in 1983 after police had killed 16 suspects with it - might be more dangerous for blacks because their arteries did not open up as fast as on 'normal people'. the detective involved now heads the unit which investigates shootings involving police officers. president george bush last year called mr gates 'an exemplary police chief,' although at the time he called the conduct of the four los angeles officers -whose acquittal this week over the beating of a black motorist triggered this week's protests and violence - 'sickening' and 'outrageous'. a high-ranking commission appointed after the beating, under the chairmanship of mr warren christopher, a lawyer and former deputy secretary of state, concluded that the los angeles police department got results, in terms of arrests, but had developed a 'siege mentality that alienates the officer from the community'. besides recommending that mr gates should go, the christopher commission urged a policy of community policing with more foot patrols, as well as measures to discipline racist police officers and to improve the investigation of complaints about police brutality. six months after its initial report, however, the commission noted that of the 44 officers identified as the object of six or more brutality complaints, two had been fired, three had resigned and 11 removed from field duty.
