the death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among non-smokers, according to a study published friday. while no direct link has been established between smoking and leukemia, research published in the british medical journal showed that the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10 cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among non-smokers. for smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day it was 57 percent, and for smokers of 21 or more cigarettes 63 percent, the study showed. "if the findings in our study represented a direct relationship between smoking and leukemia, then it must follow that smoking is responsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hitherto established causes combined," said dr. leo kinlen, director of the cancer epidemiology unit at the university of edinburgh. it should therefore be added to the world heath organization's list of tobacco-related causes of death, he wrote. thus for monocytic and myeloid leukemias, the rate among smokers of more than 20 cigarettes a day was 93 percent higher, compared with 48 percent for lymphatic leukemias. for smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death from lymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher, and for one to 10 cigarettes, 40 percent higher.
