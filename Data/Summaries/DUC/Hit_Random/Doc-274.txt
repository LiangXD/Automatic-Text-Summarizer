fiorina struck down a new mexico law requiring candidates entering a congressional primary to have belonged to their party for a year and to pay a registration fee. they claimed there is a fundamental right to be a candidate for public office, which they found among the associational rights in the first amendment. consequently, the argument that term limits are qualifications just like those already in the constitution -- and that therefore they can be added only by amending the constitution -- isn't particularly convincing. consequently, the argument that term limits are qualifications just like those already in the constitution -- and that therefore they can be added only by amending the constitution -- isn't particularly convincing. brown, the supreme court upheld a california law that prohibited an independent candidate from running for congress because he had changed his registration to independent less than 11 months before the election. where the incumbent is almost the pre-ordained winner in an election, there is no effective competition of ideas or candidates and incumbents are less responsive to the will of the electorate. states could allow an incumbent who has served a set number of years in the same office to run again, but only as a write-in candidate.
