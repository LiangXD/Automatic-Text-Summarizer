amid reports that thousands of iraqi soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a week. for one thing, iraq still apparently hasn't unleashed its stockpile of chemical weapons. perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged iraq's vaunted republican guard, which has been sitting just north of the iraq-kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the iraqi defense. despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground campaign has begun almost guarantees that the bush administration will face fresh problems growing out of the military situation. long columns of iraqi prisoners of war could be seen trudging through the desert toward the allied rear. we looked to the united states, we expected you to have the moral edge, says nasser tahboub, a jerusalem-born jordanian who has an american wife and a doctorate in political science from duke university. for the first time in history, the u.s. has gone to war with an arab and muslim nation, and we know a peaceful solution was in reach.
