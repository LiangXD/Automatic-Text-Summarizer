mr. brock said in an interview that exemptions from the minimum wage would be necessary for youths who lack entry-level job skills and for small businesses. he said boosting the level would worsen problems that many poorly educated, unskilled youths face in trying to find work in a more complex job market. i am increasingly convinced that a number of people... are not only unemployed, but unemployable, mr. brock testified. i don't want to take a chance that we add to that problem by boosting the minimum wage and thereby pricing young people out of the job market. mr. brock's suggestions for modifying the minimum-wage bill aren't likely to receive a warm welcome from congressional advocates for raising the minimum. edward kennedy (d., mass.), chairman of the senate committee, said that if mr. brock will put his ideas into a bill, the house committee will give it a hearing. many people feel that some kind of increase in the minimum wage is inevitable, he said, so an effort is afoot to see how congress can do as little harm... and as much good as possible, while boosting the wage level.
