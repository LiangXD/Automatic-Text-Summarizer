a 1987 state constitutional amendment broadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felons may own guns, a judge ruled. "if maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict or qualify the right to keep and bear arms, they could have enacted a constitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions," perkins wrote. attorney general james e. tierney said saturday that the case would be appealed, adding, "with all due respect to justice perkins, we think he is wrong." in response, the legislature enacted a constitutional amendment deleting that language, and voters approved it in november 1987. the amendment declared, "every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms,and this right shall never be questioned." he previously had been convicted under the state's habitual offender law for operating a motor vehicle after his driver's license had been revoked. perkins denied a motion to dismiss the criminal threatening charge, but threw out the gun possession charge, saying "there is simply no rational connection" between brown's previous conviction and his ownership of a firearm.
