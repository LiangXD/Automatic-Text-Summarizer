the project began with much fanfare in september when four men and four women, accompanied by 3,000 species of plants and animals, sealed themselves inside a eight-story glass structure for a two-year experiment in biological recycling. the allegations of misrepresentation involve a device that removes carbon dioxide from the air and turns it into a solid for storage inside the biosphere. the current issue of the village voice says the group secretly installed the device, violating the advertised goal of recycling all materials naturally. kathleen dyhr, a biosphere spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview that the group had indeed installed a carbon dioxide remover. dyhr said the privately financed project had no obligation to disclose all the details of work in progress. if the experiment were formally reported, written up in a publication, and no mention was made of that fact, then that would be fraud, she said. from the start, when planning for the biosphere got under way in the mid-1980s, it was billed as a futuristic experiment in closed recycling where plants and animals would provide each other with all the essentials for life.
