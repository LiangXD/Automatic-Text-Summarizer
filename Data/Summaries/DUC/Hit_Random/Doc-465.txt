a form of blood cancer that strikes children appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the body's ability to make interferon, according to a study published today. the researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as regulators that stop the body's cells from becoming cancerous. they tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes. it adds to the growing list of cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of particular genes. in the latest work, the researchers found that this section of the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. in the latest work, the researchers found that this section of the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. however, they left open the possibility that some other gene in this region besides those that make interferon could also be the tumor-suppressing gene.
