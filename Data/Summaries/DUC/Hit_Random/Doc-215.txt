the map was released as the state department of forestry officially opened the region's 1990 fire season, which means its firefighting crews have been placed on higher alert and various fire prevention regulations are now in effect. while the fire-season announcement came only two to three weeks earlier than usual in the vulnerable foothills, it was a full two months ahead of schedule in the heavily wooded mountain terrain of southern california's national forests. the last really good rainfall was back in '82-83, so our brush really hasn't recuperated in seven years, said gordon rowley, a fire management specialist with the u.s. forest service. rowley said other western states also are experiencing drought, which means they won't be able to send us the firefighting forces they normally can deploy out here.... the county fire department map shows that the most threatened residential areas include a number of hillside and canyon communities within the city of los angeles, including parts of baldwin hills, hollywood, the los feliz district, tarzana, encino, sherman oaks, sunland and sylmar. fire officials say these are areas where blazes can start and expand rapidly, spreading from open land to homes and other structures. fire officials say these are areas where blazes can start and expand rapidly, spreading from open land to homes and other structures.
