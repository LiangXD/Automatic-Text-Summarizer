the tolentinos and 100 other poor families along the albacan river in angeles, a once-bustling city of 280,000 people in the shadow of mount pinatubo, lost their homes saturday in mudslides and floods brought on by the volcano's powerful eruption. the death toll from the eruptions of mount pinatubo, combined with a series of earthquakes and torrential rains, increased to more than 200, according to philippine television. raymondo punongbayan, director of the philippine institute of volcanology and seismology, said in an interview that while the volcano remained a threat, the eruptions were simmering down and significant, critical eruptions are probably over. angeles was without electricity monday and so many stores and gasoline stations were closed that it was difficult to find food and fuel. it's about time we left, said lisa hedland, wife of an air force sergeant, as she prepared to board the cruiser long beach with her 15-month-old daughter. we have nothing except the clothes we are wearing, said solidad santiago, a 41-year-old laundry worker from angeles, who fled to a manila evacuation center sunday with most but not all of her family. we have lost everything, but still i am happy, happy to be here, said romayo garcia, a 29-year-old mason, whose house near the now-evacuated clark air base, about 10 miles east of mount pinatubo, had collapsed from the weight of volcanic ash.
