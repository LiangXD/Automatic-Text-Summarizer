through the years mr. gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing, in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime. hundreds of gang homicides occur every year in los angeles despite sweeps by the city's police. the police corps would send idealistic young people, including minorities, to serve a three -- or four -- year tour of duty after college graduation in return for federal funding of their educations. the presence of even one police corps officer witness would have deterred the criminal cops. mr. gates's statement did nothing to lessen the tragedy of the fallen officer, but like his statement about blacks, it gave comfort to bigots within and outside the department. the unit had advance knowledge that crimes were about to occur, but often stayed outside and let robberies occur, even though innocent retailers and customers were put at risk. mr. gates said that while he was shocked, he wasn't drawing conclusions and would look into the background, of the incident.
