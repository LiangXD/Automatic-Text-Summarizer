a naval commander who had observed the uss vincennes in the persian gulf said the ship had "no good reason" for shooting down an iranian civilian airliner, killing all 290 aboard. david r. carlson in the u.s. naval institute proceedings magazine this month said others had remarked on the agressive behavior of the vincennes, which had been dubbed "robo cruiser." will rogers, skipper of the vincennes at the time, said carlson's assessment was subjective and not in line with the navy's conclusions. on the day of the incident, carlson said, a crewman informed him that the vincennes had classified the plane as an iranian f-14 fighter. "the vincennes saw an opportunity for action, and pressed hard for commander middle east force to give permission to fire," carlson said. william m. fogarty, who headed the navy's investigating team, said the captain of the vincennes, will rogers iii, ordered the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken belief the airliner was an iranian f-14 fighter plane. "had i done so, the information might have come forward quickly enough to allow me to attempt to dissuade the vincennes from shooting."
