in 1985, before the federal immigration reform act, the number of illegal aliens in orange county was estimated at 229,000, ranking it just behind los angeles county in california, a county official said. for example, we have close to 50,000 people in the city that have qualified through the amnesty process for legal residency, pulido said. councilman john acosta said he was saddened by the senate's action because the city was determined to count every single person, and i know that (now) we're going to to suffer from this monetarily. loss of seats cited some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens, dole argued. adrian dove, assistant regional director for the u.s. census in charge of outreach, said that despite the senate's decision, the census bureau really doesn't know how to go about finding who was legal or illegal. opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical because the census bureau has already printed questionnaires that do not contain any question about legality of residence. if congress passes a law that says we will or will not count people, we will do what it says.
