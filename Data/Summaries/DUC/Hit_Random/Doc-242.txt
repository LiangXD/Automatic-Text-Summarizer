the ministry statement said the federal military council met on march 25 and concluded that "dissident tendencies" in slovenia were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's communist government. the police said "they had no available data which would justify such evaluations," according to the ministry statement. slovenia's communist party presidium also "expressed disagreement with part of the military council's opinions," said the statement. it published a letter to slovenia's communist party leader milan kucan from two student unions that said military action had been planned earlier this year, including the arrests of "nonconformist journalists, writers and officials." it also said the army did not notify slovenia's civilian leadership of the planned intervention. the plan was blocked by kucan and stane dolanc, slovenia's member in yugoslavia's collective presidency, after they were told about it by slovenian security organizations, the letter said. svetozar visnjic, commander of ljubljana's military command, dismissed the reports of planned military action as "nonsense and a fabrication."
