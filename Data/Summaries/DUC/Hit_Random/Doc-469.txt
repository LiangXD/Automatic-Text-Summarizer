the drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-cda _ has produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia patients treated, and none has relapsed so far. it, like hairy cell leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells, which produce disease-fighting antibodies. the latest study, published in thursday's new england journal of medicine, was directed by dr. lawrence d. piro of the scripps clinic and research foundation in la jolla, calif. scripps recently made an agreement with johnson &amp johnson's ortho pharmaceuticals to produce and distribute the drug once it's approved by the u.s. food and drug administration. in the published work, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients as far back as four years ago. however, interferon is less effective, and both of those treatments produce serious side effects. also unlike other treatments, this one appears to work after a single seven-day course of therapy.
