in the study published in the new england journal of medicine, the tb usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis infections, not new exposures to the bacteria, in people who also are infected with the aids virus. the doctors warned that besides being at risk of getting tuberculosis themselves, aids-infected addicts who carry the tb bacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with, to health care workers and other people. "the aggressive identification and treatment of hiv-infected intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is therefore of both clinical and public health importance," wrote dr. peter a. selwyn of montefiore medical center in new york. while most people with the aids virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome, people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only about a 10 percent life-long risk of getting tb. when the study began, 42 percent already were infected with hiv. seven of the eight tb cases occurred in people who were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before the study began. the doctors said that the drug is now administered along with daily methadone doses at the clinic where the study was conducted.
