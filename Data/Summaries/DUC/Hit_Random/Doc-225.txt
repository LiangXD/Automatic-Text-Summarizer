this past week, de beers announced it was increasing prices 5.5 percent, compared to a 15.5 percent increase a year earlier. jack lunzer, managing director of idc ltd., an independent diamond distributor in london, said de beers undoubtedly will continue to control the major part of world production, but its marketing arm's profits will fall. angola, which broke in 1985, has been negotiating its re-entry. it was robbed once, in the early 1980s, when some diamonds were snatched as couriers carried them from one building to another. de beers's achievement over the decades has been to mass-market what was once an aristocratic luxury without greatly diminishing its value. formally known as de beers consolidated mines ltd., and based in kimberley, south africa, the company was formed in 1888 by the british industrial colonialist cecil rhodes. now 81, oppenheimer still serves on de beers' board of directors, of which he previously was chairman.
