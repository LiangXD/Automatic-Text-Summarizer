the garden is landscaped into four plant zones, with the most flammable vegetation planted farthest from the house. zone 4, farthest from the house, consists of native vegetation that has been thinned to reduce the amount of fuel that could feed a fire. zone 3 includes plants selected for their low profile and slow-burning characteristics. wildflowers such as pacific coast iris, monkeyflower and california poppies add a splash of color to this zone. zone 2 features highly fire-retardant succulents. jade, aloe vera, phormium and evergreen currant are among the high-moisture-content plants characteristic of this zone. zone 1, closest to the residence, is a small area of plants that pose little risk of burning.
