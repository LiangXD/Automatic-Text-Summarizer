the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow' disease - which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the uk - is causing a new wave of public concern. the advisers, led by the government's chief medical officer kenneth calman and chief veterinary officer keith meldrum, put out a detailed statement to justify their view that last month's death of 65-year-old duncan templeman - following that of peter warhurst, 61, a year ago - showed 'no features that give cause for undue concern'. robert will of edinburgh's western general hospital, who has been monitoring cjd in the uk since 1990 on behalf of the health department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with bse-affected herds. 'since the illness of the cows (in templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said. the epidemic continues to defy the ministry of agriculture's predictions that it is about to wane so far this year there have been 26,695 reported cases, compared with 25,898 to the same date last year. the source of infection was protein-rich cattle feed contaminated with scrapie, a related brain disease of sheep. scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem: bse, scrapie and cjd are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which does not follow the normal rules of microbiology.
