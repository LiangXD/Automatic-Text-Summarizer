hurricane joan's 80 mph winds churned across the open caribbean today on an unusual southern path that has forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible landfall. "you just don't see many hurricanes that take this course and hug the coast." the hurricane was moving west at 10 mph and was expected to continue that motion through today. it reached hurricane force monday night and its center began to become better defined, a sign the system could intensify over open water into the western caribbean, forecasters said. on its present path, it would be at least 48 hours before the main part of the hurricane reached central america, gross said late monday. also, he said hurricanes are often sapped of strength in the far southern caribbean due to trade winds that push colder deep-ocean water to the surface, said gross. gilbert, the most devastating hurricane in recent years, left more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage as it tore through jamaica, the cayman islands and mexico's yucatan peninsula last month.
