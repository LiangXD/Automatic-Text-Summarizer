it is ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by miners in angola and canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the world's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market. this rise of illegal mining, particularly in the cuango region, which produces 80 per cent of angola's diamonds and some of its highest-quality gem stones, started in may, 1991, after the peace accord which allowed freedom of movement for the first time in 16 years. even though there are so many diggers at work, questions are being asked about whether there might be more to this 'explosion.' the cartel is organised by de beers' london-based central selling organisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds. the cso has been mopping up as many of the smuggled angolan diamonds as possible to stop havoc being created in a business already suffering severely from soggy demand in the us and japan, the two biggest markets, which share about two-thirds of demand between them. de beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market through 'sights' offered by the cso ten times a year to about 160 selected buyers. de beers has taken good care that merchant stocks have never again been built for speculative reasons, frequently going to the banks, the potential financiers of stockpiling operations, to 'educate' them about the way the diamond market works.
