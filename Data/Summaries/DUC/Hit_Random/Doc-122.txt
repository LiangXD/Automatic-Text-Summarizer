virginia's version, later copied by new york and north carolina, brought together three elements in one article -- affirmation of a right to bear arms, reliance on state militia, and opposition to a standing army: that the people have a right to keep and bear arms that a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state that standing armies, in times of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided.... this militia amendment was referred to a congressional committee, and came out of committee in this form: a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms. the senate in turn gave it its final form, briefer, unfortunately more elliptical, and with the exemption for conscientious objectors deleted: a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. certain explanations were lost or buried in this legislative process: that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the militia that just about everybody was included in the militia and that the amendment as a whole sought to minimize if not eliminate reliance on a standing army by emphasizing the role of the state militia, which would require that everyone be ready to be called to serve. the right to bear arms protected in the second amendment has to do directly with a well-regulated militia. the right to bear arms protected in the second amendment has to do directly with a well-regulated militia. the right to bear arms protected in the second amendment has to do directly with a well-regulated militia.
