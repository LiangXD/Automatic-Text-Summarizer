if he arrives there fresh from defeat on nafta, the president's authority on trade issues will be compromised. investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on nafta would throw such a spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic growth. many economists argue that the competitive forces unleashed by the accelerating collapse of international trade barriers have helped restrain global inflation. low worldwide inflation has kept bond yields at historic lows, which in turn have boosted share prices to record highs in many markets. although the president inherited the trade pact from his republican predecessor, he has invested a lot of his own political capital in getting nafta through congress. because the domestic labour market remains weak, this line has struck a strong chord with ordinary americans. stock markets in mexico and the us, however, believe the chances of success for nafta improved this week.
