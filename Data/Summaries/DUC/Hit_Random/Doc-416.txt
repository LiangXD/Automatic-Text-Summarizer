american passengers frequently assume that any ship they board in a u.s. port has met all coast guard safety requirements, a notion reinforced by coast guard approved labels on most life jackets, and fire systems on smaller boats and domestic ferries. in fact, the coast guard gives four inspections a year to ships that dock in the united states, but when the vessel is registered in another country, the coast guard only makes sure the ship provides whatever is required by international safety of life at sea regulations: twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers and life jackets for 125 percent of capacity, with the equipment in good condition. of the 100 large vessels now operating from u.s. ports -- all but two are of foreign registry -- 72 are more than 10 years old, 23 are more than 20 years old and 26 are more than 30 years old, according to figures in the coast guard magazine proceedings of the marine safety council. joel d. sipes, former chief of the coast guard's office of marine safety, testified in congress this spring: we have been concerned for a number of years that the grandfather clauses create an incentive to bring more and more older ships back into service. joel d. sipes, former chief of the coast guard's office of marine safety, testified in congress this spring: we have been concerned for a number of years that the grandfather clauses create an incentive to bring more and more older ships back into service. of the 176 deaths listed, only five were aboard ocean-going cruise vessels under foreign flags. when the safety committee met in may, it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations beyond 1994 for new ships, possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service of vessels that cannot meet the new rules.
