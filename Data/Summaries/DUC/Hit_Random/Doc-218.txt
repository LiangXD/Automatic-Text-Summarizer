this week's flare-up of western wildfires can't hold a candle to the damage wrought by last year's record-breaking fire season, but officials say a dry august could change everything. fire has charred more than 1.3 million acres of forest and range land since january in the contiguous united states, compared to 2.1 million acres by this time last year, fire officials said monday. "right now, the fire season is just starting to gear up," said sandi sacher, spokeswoman at the federal government's wildfire command post in boise, idaho. by year's end, 6 million acres had burned in the west and alaska, making 1988 the worst fire season in 30 years, and, in terms of firefighting resources committed, the most expensive in u.s. history, sacher said. the widespread drought of 1988 has been replaced by spotty rain and local areas of dry weather, sacher said. fire danger is high this week in parts of oregon, nevada and idaho, the national weather service said monday. you'll get a dry period, then a front will come through and it will rain.
