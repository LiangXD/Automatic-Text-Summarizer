robert h. bork, who once hoped for a supreme court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court monday. he was there in the capacity of a lawyer _ apparently making him the first defeated supreme court nominee ever to argue before the justices. bork, nominated by then-president reagan, has said he was the victim of a campaign of lies and distortions led by liberals. there were no references to that fight monday as bork engaged in debate with the justices and opposing lawyers over the complexities of federal banking law and related matters. bork was treated much the same as any attorney who appears before the justices. justice anthony m. kennedy, who occupies the seat that eluded bork, directed a few questions at bork. bork, 63, a former federal appeals court judge, is a fellow at the american enterprise institute and will begin teaching constitutional law in the fall at the george mason university law school in arlington, va.
