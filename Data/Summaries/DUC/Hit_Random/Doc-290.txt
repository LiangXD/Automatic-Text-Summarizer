a 1988 report by the u.s. geological survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the southern santa cruz mountains. the high probability is based on several factors, including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said clarence allen, professor of geology and geophysics at the california institue of technology in pasadena. he noted that the 1988 report, titled "probabilities of large earthquakes occurring in california on the san andreas fault," presented information that was already widely known among scientists. a quake of 7 magnitude, a "major" earthquake, is capable of widespread heavy damage. initial reports indicated widespread damage from tuesday's quake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings. in addition, some of the roadways and overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction as the bay bridge. in some areas of southern california, there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring.
