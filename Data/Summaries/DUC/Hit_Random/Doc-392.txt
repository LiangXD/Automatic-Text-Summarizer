psychologists who studied the downing of an iranian civilian airliner in the persian gulf say the military needs to better understand stress and should spend more on psychological research and improve its crew training. while progess is being made, he said, "it must be clearly recognized that these research problems are among the most difficult and complex in the entire research spectrum." the hearing by the house armed services policy subcommittee was part of the panel's examination of the destruction of iran air flight 655 that killed all 290 people on board. the navy said crew members, under battle-caused stress after just finishing a firefight with iranian gunboats, misread or misinterpreted a variety of electronic data from the aegis computers. les aspin, d-wis., chairman of the panel, said, "misinterpretations of data provided by the aegis weapon system and chaotic communications in the command center have pointed up troubles with man's ability to make fast, accurate decisions in combat." "the communications problems evident in the vincennes incident closely parallel those uncovered in analyses of the causes of crashes in civilian and military air transport," he said. "research is badly needed to understand when and just how much automation to introduce in situations where the ultimate control and responsibility must rest with the human operators," he said.
