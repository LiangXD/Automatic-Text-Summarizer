but the initial experience with the compound is especially promising, and an apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease, scientists said. there aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay away for as long as four years, says lawrence piro, chief of cancer research at scripps clinic &amp research foundation, la jolla, calif., where the drug was developed. with the lack of toxicity and the ease with which people go into remission {with 2-cda}, i think there's something really going on here, says ellin berman, a staff leukemia doctor at memorial sloan kettering cancer center, new york. scripps said it negotiated an agreement with a subsidiary of johnson &amp johnson, new brunswick, n.j., to produce and distribute 2-cda to other centers for broader clinical trials. within eight to 10 weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their blood or bone marrow the 12th had a small amount remaining in the marrow, but he declined further bone marrow monitoring, dr. piro said. when you can make all the disease go away with a single infusion of therapy, you have a disease which may be able to be cured, dr. piro said. it's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments.
