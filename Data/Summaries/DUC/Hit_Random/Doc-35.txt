"there was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature," said ed krupp, director of griffith observatory in los angeles, where 600 children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 percent of the sun's surface at 10:50 a.m. also visible were gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group of sunspots that on monday produced the most intense solar flare _ a burst of heat and radiation _ since 1984. views were best farther west and north. several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets in downtown anchorage, alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the sun at 9:13 a.m. in san francisco, the moon eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 9:52 a.m., but the event wasn't visible because of clouds that were so thick they delayed arriving flights at the airport. the percentage of the sun blocked out and time of maximum eclipse at other locations included 52 percent at 11:28 a.m. alan macrobert, spokesman for sky &amp telescope magazine, said there were 245 known eye injuries in the united states after an eclipse in 1970, but warnings about the danger reduced the number to three during a 1984 partial eclipse.
