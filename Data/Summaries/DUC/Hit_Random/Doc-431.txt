alan cranston (d-calif.) at a political event in 1984, the senator suggested keating should contribute to his campaign. in april, 1985, as a result of cranston's appeal for funds, keating collected $15,000 in checks from his employees for the california senator. it was the first of nearly $1 million that cranston solicited from keating -- $60,000 for his campaigns, $85,000 for the california democratic party and $850,000 for voter registration groups founded by the senator. mr. keating wanted me to give you those checks, he told the senator. keating asked cranston to contact then-bank board chairman m. danny wall on lincoln's behalf, and the senator agreed. -- in january, 1988, grogan, keating, cranston, cranston's son, kim, and kim's then-girlfriend, actress shelley duvall, had dinner together at jimmy's restaurant in los angeles. these meetings have been a central focus of the so-called keating five case because the regulators alleged that they were asked improperly by the senators to go easy on lincoln. he said it was during riegle's visit to keating's headquarters in phoenix in march, 1987, that the senator first proposed the idea of such meetings.
