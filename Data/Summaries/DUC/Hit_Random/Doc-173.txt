exxon corp. on wednesday increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive alaskan oil spill to $2 billion and said it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history. on wednesday, exxon spokesman william smith upped the company's estimate of the spill's total costs so far -- costs to exxon and others -- to about $2 billion. without the cleanup charge and accounting gain, exxon said its net income for the year would have been $4.7 billion, down 10.6% from 1988, despite higher oil and gas prices. analysts said exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage from the charges. still, exxon's stock, whose performance has lagged behind that of other major oil firms, could suffer from continuing negative publicity surrounding the valdez spill and the subsequent spill of 567,000 gallons of heating oil into the arthur kill waterway between new york and new jersey on jan. the previous charges covered everything from wages to boat rentals to boots, as well as payments so far of $177 million in claims by fishermen, cannery workers and other individuals affected by the spill, said exxon spokesman james robertson in anchorage. meanwhile, exxon confirmed wednesday that it would shut down its denver exploration and production office, which employs about 105 people.
