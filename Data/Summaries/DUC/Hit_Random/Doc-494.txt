in a recent poll, grass-roots republicans -- by a resounding 47 percent to 29 percent -- said they would make that trade in a minute. like many accomplished military commanders -- eisenhower throughout the 1940s, for example -- powell has kept everyone guessing. but on domestic issues, powell has signaled values that reflect the experiences that shaped him -- a course that led him down roads many republicans see only from inside their cars, with the windows sealed and the doors locked. powell is, after all, not a product of comfortable suburbia, but a son of jamaican immigrants who was born in harlem, grew up in the south bronx, watched his parents struggle to earn a living as a sales clerk and a seamstress in new york's garment district, attended the public city college of new york and joined the rotc during the 1950s, partly because it was one of the few institutions offering opportunities to blacks. more recently, powell displayed impatience with the progress of that struggle, when he told a congressional committee questioning the large number of minority soldiers in the gulf war that he wish(ed) that there were other activities in our society... as open as the military is to upward mobility, to achievement, to allowing them in. rather, if he choose a political career as a democrat, powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's henry scoop jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions on defending u.s. interests abroad. if powell hints even the slightest interest, and democrats are uncharacteristically alert, it could set off the kind of bipartisan bidding war not seen since 1948, when activists in both parties tried to draft eisenhower as their presidential candidate.
