harlow and his team predicted the 1989 eruption of redoubt volcano in alaska, but few lives were threatened in the remote area. three weeks ago, harlow joined a team of five u.s. geological survey scientists who worked with 10 filipino scientists to try to forecast the eruption of the volcano, which had been dormant for about 600 years. harlow's team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption is imminent. gradually building earthquakes were followed by the release of gas, the buildup of magma and finally the huge explosions that sent ash clouds more than 75,000 feet into the sky and sent avalanches of hot ash pouring down the narrow valleys west of the volcano. lord said harlow's love affair with volcanoes began when he was an undergraduate student at dartmouth college and his professor took the entire class to observe an eruption in guatemala. he's somebody who's fascinated by that kind of energy, said lord, a psychotherapist who has accompanied harlow to several volcanoes. she knows daddy is in the philippines and that he's fixing a volcano, lord said.
