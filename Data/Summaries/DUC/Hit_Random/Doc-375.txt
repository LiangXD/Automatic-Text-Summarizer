two of the plates sink beneath the islands of japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the earth directly below tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. </p> <p> most other earthquake-prone regions, including california, only have to worry about two colliding plates. </p> <p> the threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is being reclaimed from tokyo bay to serve the needs of millions more who are flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity. many experts here think even those grim estimates are far too low. </p> <p> when the great quake strikes, as everyone here knows it must, it will hit a city that is already so crowded that on a typical day it dwarfs the worst traffic jams that los angeles has to offer. </p> <p> despite widespread planning efforts, there will be few places for people to run, and it will be extremely difficult to reach safety even for those who know where to go. in his worst nightmares, he sees endless streams of cars ablaze on crowded streets, forming ribbons of fire extending out to the suburbs. </p> <p> hampered by ruptured water lines, unable to move on the jammed streets, firefighters would be helpless, forced to witness a holocaust of unthinkable dimensions. </p> <p> tokyo's metropolitan fire department has estimated that fully one-third of the city could be destroyed by fire in a great quake. is that also a special case? </p> <p> although he thinks the question needs more study, iemura is troubled by the fact that much of tokyo is built on areas similar to san francisco's marina district. </p> <p> and like san francisco, tokyo is extremely short of land on which to build the high rises needed to house the millions who continue to flock to this crowded city. </p> <p> the answer to the land shortage, japanese authorities have concluded, is to reclaim more land from tokyo bay -- a prospect that deeply troubles many experts. many of the new structures going up in tokyo these days are built on filled land, and some people here hope someday to fill in the entire bay, making room for even more people and more buildings. </p> <p> if san francisco was not an exceptional case, that trend could prove disastrous, many experts believe. </p> <p> tokyo university's shima believes there is only one answer, and that is to reverse the flow of people into tokyo. </p> <p> one group is proposing that the capital be moved out of tokyo, hoping that the forced move of government workers will result in a lower death toll when the quake hits. many of the new structures going up in tokyo these days are built on filled land, and some people here hope someday to fill in the entire bay, making room for even more people and more buildings. </p> <p> if san francisco was not an exceptional case, that trend could prove disastrous, many experts believe. </p> <p> tokyo university's shima believes there is only one answer, and that is to reverse the flow of people into tokyo. </p> <p> one group is proposing that the capital be moved out of tokyo, hoping that the forced move of government workers will result in a lower death toll when the quake hits. the pacific and the philippine sea plates are being forced under the eurasia plate, and the two subducting plates collide directly beneath tokyo. </p> <p> that dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed tokyo in 1923, as well as about 1,000 smaller quakes every month. </p>
