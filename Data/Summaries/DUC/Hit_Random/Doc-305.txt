but thomas, who has risen in republican ranks as an advocate of bootstrap conservatism, would present a striking change from marshall, a civil-rights pioneer and an anchor of the court's declining liberal faction. although the catholic church vigorously opposes abortion, thomas has apparently never taken a public position on abortion or on the dimensions of the constitutional right to privacy, on which the right to abortion was based. views on big issues unknown thomas' views on the other major issues remain unknown, although the 1990 confirmation hearing for his seat on the court of appeals was widely viewed on capitol hill and in ideological interest groups as a rehearsal for a supreme court nomination. leaders of abortion rights groups said monday that they would press the senate to deny confirmation to thomas unless he expresses his support for the supreme court's abortion precedents, including continued adherence to roe vs. wade, the 1973 ruling that established the constitutional right to abortion. abortion faction speaks out the souter model of silence and evasion that we saw last year is absolutely unacceptable, said kate michelman, executive director of the national abortion rights action league. rights groups cautious civil rights groups took a cautious tone monday, essentially noting concerns and saying they would study the record. we urge the senate not to rush to judgment, said a statement from a leadership conference on civil rights, an umbrella group of 185 organizations that took an early and leading role in the defeat of the bork nomination.
