unfortunately, there is the second amendment to the constitution: a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. since the amendment's stated purpose is arming state militias, they reason, it creates no individual right to own a gun. i'm not sure this is as clinching an argument as kates seems to think. i'm not sure this is as clinching an argument as kates seems to think. kates also marshals impressive historical evidence that the second amendment, like other bill of rights protections, was intended to incorporate english common law rights of the time, which pretty clearly included the right to keep a gun in your home for reasons having nothing to do with the militia. working from that decision and the common law, kates says the amendment's protection should be limited to weapons in common use among law-abiding people, useful for law enforcement or personal defense, and lineally descended from weapons known to the framers. he says that the amendment places no limit on mandatory registration or laws against concealed weapons in public.
