relations between the uk and china have deteriorated markedly since mr patten, with the general support of the hong kong people, announced proposals on october 7 for elections in 1994 and 1995 which would allow for greater, though still limited, democracy in choosing local leaders. agreement to proceed with the hkdollars 163.5bn project was only reached a year ago when mr john major, britain's prime minister, visited beijing. in a robust performance before a special session of the legislative council (legco) on saturday, mr patten reissued his challenge to beijing to respond with constructive alternatives to proposals he made on october 7 for the colony's political development. the governor said he was prepared to discuss these alternatives with china but reminded legislators that any alternatives had to be fair, open and command the support of the people of hong kong. with an eye on these legislators, the governor reminded all members of legco that it is they who will have to pass any legislation drawn up to provide for the forthcoming elections. the proposals, which mr patten believes are consistent with anglo-chinese agreements and chinese law, provide for a greater, though still restricted, application of democracy in the conduct of future elections. according to aides, the governor believes he can carry the legislature in the event of failure to find agreement with china, they promise a publicity campaign of the sort which prepared the colony for his policy speech.
