the coast guard also said there were unconfirmed reports that two others had been picked up by another boat. but coast guard petty officer bob morehead said the search was called off in the late afternoon because winds were in excess of 60 m.p.h. and waves were at 12 feet and building. shortly thereafter, the national hurricane center in miami announced that chantal was blowing at more than 74 m.p.h., strong enough to move it into the lowest hurricane classification, and the winds were later reported at 75 m.p.h. the boat was ordered into port because of the impending storm. the best estimate monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the western louisiana or upper texas coast. in that event, the houston area would have extensive flooding, said bill evans, flood watch director for the harris county flood control district. besides heavy rains and wind, the hurricane is expected to cause tides 5 to 7 feet above normal.
