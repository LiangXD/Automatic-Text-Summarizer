the republic of slovenia plans to begin work on a constitution that will give it full sovereignty within a new yugoslav confederation, the state tanjug news agency reported monday. slovenia, whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction of yugoslavia's total population of 23 million, is the most politically liberal and prosperous of the country's six member republics. slovenia "should be set up as a sovereign state, with all attributes of factual authority and with full international-legal rights," tanjug said, quoting from a declaration of the slovenian presidency, the top local ruling body. slovenia has been frequently accused by politicians and the media in yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, and particularly in the country's largest republic of serbia, of harboring separatist tendencies and of protecting its own interests at the expense of federal goals. only 15 percent of the slovenes surveyed expressed their wish for slovenia to remain a republic within yugoslavia in the present form. both slovenia and croatia, the two yugoslav republics that held free elections this year, have proclaimed a readiness to turn the yugoslav federation of six republics and two provinces into a looser confederation of states cooperating voluntarily. both slovenia and croatia, the two yugoslav republics that held free elections this year, have proclaimed a readiness to turn the yugoslav federation of six republics and two provinces into a looser confederation of states cooperating voluntarily.
