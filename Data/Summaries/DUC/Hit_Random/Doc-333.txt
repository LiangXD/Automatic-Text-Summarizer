but on matters of politics, george bush and john sununu were not so oddly matched. during the 1988 campaign, bush conceded in interviews that he had to do some of the dirty work in attacking dukakis his alternating nice and nasty faces came to be known as george the gentle and george the ripper. by making the abrasive former governor of new hampshire his chief of staff, bush hoped that he could keep a certain balance of rough and smooth in his governing and in his politics. in the many times over the past three years when sununu helped land the president in the political soup, the washington political cognoscenti speculated that bush was keeping his chief of staff only out of loyalty to sununu for helping him win the new hampshire primary, or because bush was too nice to fire anyone, or because he was too indecisive. his approval ratings began dropping again, important republicans scorned by sununu began going on the record with their advice to bush that he was being ill served by his chief of staff, and finally and most important, the president's wife, barbara, and oldest son, george, turned on sununu. his approval ratings began dropping again, important republicans scorned by sununu began going on the record with their advice to bush that he was being ill served by his chief of staff, and finally and most important, the president's wife, barbara, and oldest son, george, turned on sununu. but this time, his friends say, he will look for aides who can play those roles while also playing by the rules of the washington game.
