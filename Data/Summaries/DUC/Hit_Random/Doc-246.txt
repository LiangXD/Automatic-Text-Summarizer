his statement, just a day after both sides agreed to a cease-fire, indicated that a plan to resolve the state's ethnic, political and economic disputes had gone off the rails less than 18 hours after it was accepted. the ultimatum also appeared to confirm slovenian fears that the army is acting outside government control in its effort to subjugate the secessionist republic. the tanjug news agency reported that 200,000 serbs were expected to join a territorial militia in serbia, the biggest yugoslav republic, which opposes independence for slovenia and croatia, and negovanovic said croatia had ordered a mobilization of its police reserves. urgent legislative meeting slovenia's parliament was called into emergency session after a 12-point list of demands from the army was presented to republic leaders, insisting that all impediments to federal army operations be removed as part of a western-brokered cease-fire. but saturday night markovic charged that slovenia's president milan kucan had torpedoed the plan by insisting that the moratorium on independence had to be approved by his parliament to take effect. at the end of the day, the maneuvering by all three republics ensured a prolongation of the crisis that has deprived the country of a civilian commander in chief for more than six weeks and effectively left the army to make its own moves. the crisis evoked further expressions of anguish from foreign leaders, and for the first time a high-placed u.s. official hinted that the administration may be weighing the possibility of recognizing croatia and slovenia.
