although it has always been difficult to measure the effect of crashes on travel, this accident comes just as people were starting to get over fears of terrorism related to the persian gulf war. moments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23 miles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, mr. hall said. a federal aviation administration official said, there were some reports of gusting winds but whether or not that had any impact or whether there was any kind of mechanical problem, i can't speculate. if preliminary reports that there was wind shear in the area are true, then that would indicate there was some instability in the atmosphere, he added. the last major u.s. wind shear accident occurred in dallas in 1985, when a delta air lines jet crashed on approach. an eight-year-old girl who was playing nearby, was treated for a head injury and released. it was delivered in may 1982 to now-defunct frontier airlines.
