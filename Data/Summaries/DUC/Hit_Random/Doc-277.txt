the republicans in 1951 wanted to ensure that there would never be another f.d.r., so they pushed through the 22nd amendment limiting presidents to two terms. the first president to come under the restriction was dwight d. eisenhower, a republican who might very well have won a third term. eager for straws in the wind in an otherwise trendless political year, some journalists have seen in the oklahoma vote a backlash against incumbents, a manifestation of public alienation and an ominous sign to the democrats, the party that holds the largest number of legislative seats. it is republicans, naturally enough, who seem to be the most enthusiastic puffers of term limitation, since they have the most to gain, at least in the short term, from an indiscriminate clean-out of the nation's deliberative bodies. but it's a safe bet that more people will be using state seats to groom for higher office if they know that the law will force them out soon. one thing that legislators now have going for them is that they can become conversant with public issues and so challenge, if they care to, the self-serving propaganda of the special interests. these unelected officials are permanent and beyond the reach of voters, while the very people who are in some measure accountable will be hustled out of office.
