the devastating earthquake in the republic of tadzhikistan was the second to strike the soviet union in two months. an official at dushanbe's seismic center said the quake was strong enough to knock things off shelves in tall apartment buildings in the city, but that it caused no known damage or injuries there. the earthquake unhinged a wall of sodden dirt and mud at least five miles wide that buried the village of okuli-bolo and much of sharora, said erkin kasimov, an official of tadzhikistan's foreign ministry. it said all of the village's streets had been buried under the 50-foot-high layer of earth that the earthquake detached from a hill near the village. "when the earthquake came, it was like a catapult, and it hurled the sodden earth onto the villages below," kasimov said. in washington, u.s. state department spokesman charles redman said he knew of no request for assistance from the soviets. in washington, u.s. state department spokesman charles redman said he knew of no request for assistance from the soviets.
