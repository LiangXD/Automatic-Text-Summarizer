the white house yesterday disclosed that kuwait's ousted government has formally asked the u.s. to enforce the total trade embargo the united nations has imposed on iraq, allowing the u.s. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying iraqi goods. mr. baker declined to use the word blockade, but said that interdiction of iraqi shipments would begin almost instantly. the naval interdiction force is part of an overall american strategy that officials say is designed to leave the iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation. iraq's first option, of course, may be simply to sit tight and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the west can live without iraqi and kuwaiti oil. israel has publicly declared that it will respond to an iraqi attack on jordan because it won't allow iraq's dangerous army to take control of jordan's long border with israel. if iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition, the bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the american public and the west in general, and could open the possibility that moderate arabs -- even including saudi arabia -- might drop out of the effort against iraq and accept some deal from saddam hussein. in the first days after president bush announced the dispatching of u.s. troops, they note, the iraqi leader made several nationwide addresses indirectly -- having them read by a television announcer.
