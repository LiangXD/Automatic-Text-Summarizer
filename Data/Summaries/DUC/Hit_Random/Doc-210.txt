the chambers of commerce in veurne and courtrai, along with the west flanders regional development authority in bruges, are gearing up to become part of what they refer to as the 'new european metropolitan area.' according to mr anthony vande candelare, an urban planner who made a study of the influence of the channel tunnel on the west of belgium and the north of france: 'overnight, the belgian coast and the north of france will become the centre of europe.' the belgian chambers in the regions most directly affected believe there are two main areas for development: firstly, increasing traffic through western flanders as holidaymakers and freight carriers head towards the tunnel-opening in calais and secondly tourism. to benefit fully, however, a crucial 7km stretch of the e40 european motorway between veurne and the french border has yet to be completed. the belgian authorities have dragged their feet over decisions to dedicate new areas, he says. it has been slower to develop the tourist potential of the channel tunnel than france. as mr verstraete of the veurne chamber of commerce says: 'tourism is very important... we really have to develop our hotels and tourist infrastructure.'
