crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s. compensatory funding will be available from the international monetary fund, but when this and other aid commitments are taken into account there is certain to be an unfilled gap in the region, which for zimbabwe will mean diverting other aid funds and export earnings to pay for food. the entire southern african region will need an estimated 10m tonnes of food imports this year. this will have serious repercussions on mining and manufacturing, with mining sources warning that output and exports could fall by as a much as a fifth. some mines are also in difficulty because of the water situation, while mineral exports could be jeopardised by transport congestion. the country's textile and clothing industry - the main exporter of manufactured goods - has warned of production cutbacks and lay-offs unless it is allowed to import cotton this year. the dairy sector, like maize, was in crisis before the drought, because of the government's producer price policy, which has pushed farmers into export crops (such as tobacco), horticulture and even game farming.
