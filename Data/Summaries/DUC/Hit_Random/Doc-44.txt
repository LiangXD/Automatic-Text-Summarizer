about 10,000 people _ including 3,000 foreigners _ have converged on joensuu, about 50 miles from the soviet border. at joensuu, 310 miles northeast of helsinki, the sun will be 5 degrees above the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers. "we completely sold out the 10,000 special eyeglasses we made for this event, and our extra stock is finished too," she said in a television interview saturday. during the past week, newspapers, television and radio have been full of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice for spectators not to stare directly into the sun. the eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide from the northern baltic sea and southeast finland, across the kola peninsula and northeast soviet union, to the aleutian islands near alaska. scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse, including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun. however, scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than in longer eclipses, such as the seven-minute eclipse seen from northern kenya on june 30, 1973.
