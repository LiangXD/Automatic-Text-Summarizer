unfortunately, it's impossible to completely remove the oil unless you steam-clean the tanker, and nobody intends to do that, robbins said. reacting to the largest oil spill in the nation's history, the republican-led senate acted with unusual speed to move the six bills through the chamber and to the house. however, it appeared unlikely that the democrat-controlled house would approve the entire package before adjournment, which is scheduled for may 9. 11-million-gallon spill the senate action came five weeks after the tanker exxon valdez struck a reef, spewing more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into the fish- and wildlife-rich sound. the senate bills would increase civil fines for spill damage impose a surcharge on oil producers to boost the state's spill-response fund prevent oil companies from deducting spill costs from their oil-production taxes require the state to create spill contingency plans establish a spill-response office and cleanup corps, and create a commission to investigate the exxon valdez spill. more bills pending more than a dozen other spill-related bills are still pending in both chambers of the legislature. exxon reported saturday that it has paid out $500,000 to 150 fishermen on claims of lost work.
