robert heron bork does not dwell on past disappointments. sitting in his office at the american enterprise institute, his back to his word processor, he briefly considers what might have been: "i don't want to spend the rest of my life reliving it. and you can't sit down and write 300 pages of connected argument to show why this is the right approach. bork has plans for perhaps two more books, one in more academic detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools, and another on the relationship of law and the culture. he is catching up on reading he's not had a chance to do, making up for longtime neglect: flexner's four volumes on washington, english philosopher john stuart mill and his critics. he was halfway down the slope, he says, "when the muscles began to flutter and that's not very good because you have to get down the rest of the mountain." the institute does not make grave demands on its members.
