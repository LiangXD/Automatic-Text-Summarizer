they know him well for not only is he a neighbouring farmer (his farm is just 170 km away by dirt road and that qualifies as 'neighbour' in this vast hot countryside) but he is also south africa's minister of agriculture. mr kraai van niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on continued political reform in south africa, and prieska is the centre of his constituency. he had delivered a speech at another town that morning now he was pressing the flesh of his fellow farmers before addressing a house meeting in the late afternoon and another in the local town hall in the evening. but if the majority of south africa's white electorate votes against calls by the conservative party and the awb for a return to old ways, the minister will be able to return to other pressing problems in his department. when i went with him to his 13,000-hectare holding, which has an annual rainfall of just 6 inches and where temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s centigrade are normal throughout the long summer, he explained that the secret of success on such dry bush veldt was to restrict stocking rates (he runs only one merino wool sheep per 10 hectares) and to conserve what little moisture was available. this meant moving each 300-head flock on a regular basis from one 100-hectare camp (pasture) to another so as not to destroy the indigenous grasses and bushes sprouting from the sandy, rocky terrain and which, incredibly to my unaccustomed eye, sustained the animals in good condition. some commentators have suggested that the port facilities are inadequate to handle such volumes within the time available but mr van niekerk assured me that his department had done the calculations and confirmed that they can and that imports have already begun to arrive.
