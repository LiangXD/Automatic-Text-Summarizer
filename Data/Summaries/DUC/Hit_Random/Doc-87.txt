the u.n. agency, in its first comprehensive look at global tuberculosis in a decade, said the disease kills nearly 3 million people a year, most of them between the ages of 15 and 59, the segment of the population that is economically most productive. it estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), which causes aids, and tuberculosis. the agency estimated that between 15 million and 20 million adults will be infected with hiv by the year 2000, and it predicted that the number of cases and deaths from tuberculosis will rise sharply as a result, especially in sub-saharan africa, latin america and southeast asia. tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease of the lungs and other organs caused by a bacterium transmitted through the air when infected people cough or sneeze. also, an estimated 1.7 billion individuals worldwide carry the organism but are not infectious to others. but when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as it can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect numerous others. in the united states, public health officials began to recognize about five years ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was making a surprising comeback as a result of the aids epidemic.
