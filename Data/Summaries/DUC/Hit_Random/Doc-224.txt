the office of fair trading said tuesday it was investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a london-based diamond cartel controlled by south africa's giant de beers diamond organization. the watchdog body said de beers "appeared to have" a monopoly on diamond trading in london and it was interested in establishing whether there had been an abuse of the monopoly. consolidated gold fields plc, a british mining concern with no diamond interests, acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by luxembourg-based minorco sa. a consolidated gold spokesman, commenting on condition he was not identified, said the company wanted to point up the "monopolistic tendencies" of south africa's anglo-american group of companies. as well as selling the stones mined by de beers and other south african companies, the organization trades on behalf of diamond producers including zaire, australia, botswana and the soviet union. the office of fair trading said it would first have to establish whether it had jurisdiction over the central selling organization because although it is based in london, de beers is a south african company. "it's still early" in the investigation, said the spokesman, commenting on condition he was not identified.
