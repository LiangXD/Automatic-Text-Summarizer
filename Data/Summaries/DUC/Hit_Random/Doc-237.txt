the white house 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110 republicans in favour, 65-75 democrats in favour and 20-30 leaning towards it. however the anti-nafta forces expect a different outcome. they count 190-200 democrats against, 10-15 democrats leaning against, and 5-10 republicans opposed. the pro-nafta campaign this week began moving into high gear. president bill clinton on wednesday gave his second impassioned speech on nafta at an exhibit on the white house lawn of products likely to benefit from nafta. he envisioned continent-wide free trade 'when we'll have over 700m people in this trading bloc, united in believing that we can help one another grow and flourish,' he said. across town, the afl-cio trade union grouping on wednesday had its own products exhibit, but those were likely to be hurt by nafta.
