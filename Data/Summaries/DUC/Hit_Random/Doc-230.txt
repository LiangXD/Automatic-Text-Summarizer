only weeks before the mine came into production in july 1992 at a cost of usdollars 400m, de beers' central selling organisation, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from angola. mr gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the 5.6m carats a year de beers predicted venetia would yield at full production. last year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output and processed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats. venetia was the first new south african diamond mine for 25 years. the mine has also revitalised de beers' production, as it is accounting for half the group's output in south africa and replacing production from its 100-year-old kimberley mines, which are now fading away. and, while venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected 23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour relations and environmental issues, at least as far as south africa is concerned. venetia is also breaking with the de beers' tradition that, for security reasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security area once it is no longer useful.
