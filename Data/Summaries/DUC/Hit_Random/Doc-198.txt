reports confirm that shortly after arriving in beirut, ahmad 'abd-al-karim left for the frc's al-rawdah camps in western al-biqa' from where he followed the investigation through reports sent to him by people who secretly work for the frc and who provided him with information in exchange for generous sums of money. the security information the investigators have collected on the al-ma'ayitah assassination shows that as soon as the imyo was exposed, jordanian fundamentalist elements belonging to various organizations such as muhammad's army, the islamic liberation army, and the imyo and others moved to neighboring arab countries. the information gathered also shows that some jordanian fundamentalist elements moved to iran where they received training courses in the al-quds camp and the kermandi [name as transliterated] camp, and courses in intelligence work in the darjah [name as transliterated] institute. detailing this cooperation that lead to al-ma'ayitah's assassination, the security sources note that the al-ramlah al- bayda' area in beirut contained a secret headquarters for walid khalid, the frc official spokesman who was assassinated in the lebanese capital on 30 july 1992. the security agencies' information suggests that al-bishtawi fled to burj al- barajinah camp after the crime and then moved to cyprus where he joined jordanian fundamentalist elements living there with tunisian fundamentalists from the rachid ghanouchi-led al-nahdah movement. the frc (abu-nidal group) took immediate steps after al- ma'ayitah's assassination. it also hastened to send one of its officials to lebanon to follow the investigation and try to lessen its repercussions out of fear that al-ma'ayitah's assassination may be one of the fatal mistakes committed by the frc and may negatively affect the organization's future in lebanon and jordan.
