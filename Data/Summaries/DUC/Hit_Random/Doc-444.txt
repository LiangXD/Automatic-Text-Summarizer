president quett masire of botswana said thursday that industrial nations can help relieve drought and hunger in africa by reducing global warming caused by the greenhouse effect. masire and dr. bernard ledea ouedraogo, an anti-hunger organizer in burkina faso, were honored as co-winners of the 1988 africa prize for leadership for their efforts in averting hunger. experts believe that due to the organizing efforts of masire's government, not one person died of drought-induced famine in botswana. "the industrialized countries may do more for africa in the long run by helping to reduce global warming than by supplying short-term aid, however welcome that is at the time. the other africa prize-winner, ouedraogo, has organized about 500,000 peasants in nine countries in africa to develop their villages based on traditional cooperative village leadership. the villagers in burkina faso, chad, gambia, guinea-bissau, mali, mauritania, niger, senegal and togo raise vegetables, learn new farming techniques, improve literacy, fight erosion, replant forests, build roads and improve health care. the africa prize consists of $100,000 and a statue, awarded by the new york-based hunger project.
