and the abrasive chief of staff is discovering that the dozens of people he has insulted or slighted -- from administration officials to members of congress -- are watching his travails with thinly disguised relish. and suddenly, the political community is abuzz with questions about how long sununu will last in his job and how someone so bright could get himself in so much trouble. but the incident raises questions about sununu's judgment because it came only a few weeks after reports of his use of government jets for personal and political purposes. white house spokesman marlin fitzwater, amplifying bush's comments, made it clear that bush had told sununu that he was concerned by the appearance of impropriety and that he wanted his chief of staff to take no more embarrassing trips. and some former white house officials say sununu should recognize that he is not serving bush well. in light of his problems with his jet travel and all that, he ought to be a little careful, said lyn nofziger, a white house political director under ronald reagan. as sununu himself has noted, some of the criticism goes with the job of saying no to administration officials and lawmakers who want the president's ear.
