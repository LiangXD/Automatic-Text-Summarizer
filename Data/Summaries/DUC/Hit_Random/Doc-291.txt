the san francisco quake measuring 7.1 was comparable to the earthquake that struck santiago and central chile in march, 1985, killing 180 people and toppling some 70,000 homes. both areas are situated along the pacific ring of fire, the huge faults created by the collision of massive plates of the earth's surface. the frequency of earth movements prompts chileans to say that every president has at least one major earthquake during the traditional six-year term in office. the long history of earth movements in chile has led to a sharing of information with u.s. and japanese scientists and engineers over the behavior of the earth and of buildings during earthquakes. chilean earthquakes tend to be sharper and last longer than those of california, leading to differences in building design. just a few months before the 1906 earthquake in san francisco, a quake measuring 8.5 struck the central chilean coast, destroying the city of valparaiso. on may 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles long in southern chile, releasing energy nearly 1,000 times that of this year's san francisco quake.
