the navy announced friday that 15 crew members of the uss vincennes, the cruiser that shot down an iranian jetliner in the persian gulf last summer, will be disciplined for drug abuse. "there is no connection now to the july 3 incident in the persian gulf to what has happened on board the vincennes," said navy cmdr. according to pentagon analysts, split-second decisions were affected by the inability of radar-scope interpreters to immediately match the plane's "blip" with digital direction, altitude and speed information displayed on another screen. none of the sailors involved in the drug sweep were in positions that may have influenced the decision by capt. dillon noted that the 15 sailors represent 3.9 percent of the 384 sailors on board. "that is less than the 5.4 percent average for the entire navy," he said. the announcement came as preparations were under way at the naval station san diego for saturday's change of command aboard the vincennes.
