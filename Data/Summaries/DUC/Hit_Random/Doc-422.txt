the year was 1955 and five new resort hotels had just opened, prompting the magazine to question where they would get people to fill them. nearly 20,000 new hotel rooms either are under construction or awaiting groundbreaking, as resorts compete to add rooms they hope will bring in even more tourists and gamblers in the near future. such extremely high rates meant potential guests often were turned away by a lack of rooms: on weekends, it is nearly impossible to get a room and on three-day holiday weekends it's even worse. two resorts _ the riviera and the flamingo hilton _ are about to begin work on expansions that will bring them to more than 4,000 rooms apiece. the riviera opened a new 1,000-room highrise march 1 and plans to begin construction of a 1,700-room tower in the fall. the company's downtown resort regularly sells out its rooms. part of the las vegas lure also comes from room rates that average $45 a night, far below the $100 or more charged by non-gaming hotels in other cities.
