the lawsuit, filed wednesday by the failing savings and loan, claims that milken and others manipulated and coerced columbia and other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky high-yield bonds. "absent such deceit and manipulations it would have been clear that the market for junk bonds was highly illiquid and that junk bonds were unsuitable investments for savings and loan institutions," the suit says. columbia, based in beverly hills, said in the lawsuit that milken and other drexel officials manipulated, coerced and deceived the thrift by promising that the market for the bonds would remain active and the thrift would make money. "it is outrageous now to blame michael milken for losses as a result of strategies and decisions that were implemented long after he was no longer active at drexel burnham lambert, and which he did not endorse or agree with," the statement said. columbia was one of many savings and loans, big investors and other institutions that invested heavily in deals financed or supported by drexel in the 1980s. columbia says in the suit that its junk bonds have a total face value of $4.3 billion, but that it has written down their value to $2.5 billion to account for the decline in their market price. the suit says columbia was "ill-equipped" to make use of relaxed federal laws in the early 1980s that allowed thrifts to invest in corporate securities such as junk bonds.
