if mr ernesto zedillo, mexico's next president, had any doubts about the difficulties of reforming mexico's governing party and the country's corrupt judicial and legal system, the assassination last week of mr jose francisco ruiz massieu, the party's number two official, will probably have removed them. mr ruiz massieu's killing was allegedly ordered by mr manuel munoz rocha, a federal deputy of the ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri), and mr abraham rubio canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to the gulf drug cartel in the state of tamaulipas. this alleged alliance between a hardliner in the governing party and a man with links to a drug gang has underlined concerns that efforts by mr zedillo to reform his party and the country's criminal justice system will be met with fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from these changes. according to testimony from the alleged accomplices to the assassination, the conspirators drew up a list of reform-minded politicians with plans to kill all of them. since mr ruiz massieu's assassination, there has been renewed speculation that political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the killing six months ago of mr luis donaldo colosio, the ruling party's reform-minded presidential candidate, even though no evidence has emerged to indicate this is the case. mr munoz rocha has promised to hand himself in if his safety is guaranteed, according to a statement by mexico's congress. mr ignacio pichardo, the president of the party, declared on monday that mr munoz rocha 'never had intellectual interests, never raised issues of political theory, and was never associated with making ideological pronouncements.'
