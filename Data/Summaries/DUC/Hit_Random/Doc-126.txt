-- more than 90% of police chiefs and sheriffs surveyed agree that criminals are not affected by a ban on any type of firearm, while more than 70% oppose waiting periods for the same reason. -- a prisoner survey conducted by james d. wright et al. found that unarmed felons listed tougher penalties for using a gun as an important reason for not arming themselves. -- 75%-80% of u.s. violent crimes are committed by career criminals, many on some form of conditional or early release (30%-35% of career criminals are rearrested with previous criminal charges still pending). -- gary kleck found that using a gun for protection from violent crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- reduces the likelihood that the crime will be completed and that intended victims will be injured. as a law-abiding citizen, it would be of comfort to know that other potential handgun buyers would be screened and keep those with a criminal past from owning a handgun. the reason washington has yet to enact serious gun-control laws is due to the enormous voting and financial pressure of the pro-gun lobby. mr. gartner has now made it abundantly clear that his goal is the elimination of handguns from our society. i find it incongruous that the president of nbc news, a man who should believe in the broadening of constitutional rights, obviously has no regard for the second amendment rights to keep and bear arms. as evidenced by new york city and washington, which have the nation's strictest gun-control laws and virtually ban the ownership of handguns by law-abiding citizens, mr. gartner's placebo doesn't work because it ignores the root causes of suicide and crime. when we realize that the individual right to keep and bear arms is our ultimate defense against tyranny, all of the arguments about magazine capacity, armor-piercing bullets, sporting use, etc. suddenly stand before us in their naked falsity.
