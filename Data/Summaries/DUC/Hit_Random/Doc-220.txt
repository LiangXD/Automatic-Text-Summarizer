the new year ushers in a new wildfire season, an unwelcome thought to the residents of this small montana tourist town on the northeastern corner of yellowstone national park. pinched between the storm creek and clover-mist blazes, an estimated 150 seasonal residents and dozens of tourists were evacuated twice while hundreds of firefighters faced down walls of flame which threatened annihilation. eventually, millions of dollars, thousands of man hours, and an early autumn snowfall saved the towns. "the first thing most people around here did was go on vacation," said patti smith, owner with her husband, bob, of the bearclaw service and cabins, a gas station and small motel. "business was way down this fall because we didn't have the hunters, but we got a lot of curious weekenders from cody and billings who wanted to see how bad it was." the second time the sirens went off and we had to leave, my parents had just arrived from north platte, neb., so we all went to red lodge (mont.), got nice motel rooms, and crashed." in his 18 years of studying wildfires, norum has come across several incidents where wildfires buried themselves in the roots of trees and grasses and smoldered all winter only to pop up through the snow in the spring.
