president bush today said he could suppport an increased minimum wage but only if congress also established a sub-minimum training wage he said would prevent a loss of jobs. "i've always said that my position on minimum wage is that i would want it linked to a training wage, to a differential of sorts, so that you don't throw people out of work by raising the minimum wage," bush said at a white house news conference. bush said he had a "certain flexibility" on the question and would await the recommendations of labor secretary elizabeth dole. the president's comments came a day after mrs. dole told the senate labor committee that bush's support of legislation to raise the minimum wage would hinge on whether lawmakers included a training wage in the legislation. bush's stand puts him in opposition to the head of the labor committee, edward m. kennedy, who said thursday he remained opposed to a training wage and was confident his bill to raise the minimum hourly wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 would pass this year. "we have really not at this point had an opportunity to work through the legislative agenda so i do want an opportunity to go through this before i get into any great detail of what he is willing to support," mrs. dole said. organized labor supports the increased minimum wage but opposes the training wage, in part because it believes some employers would use the lower wage to cut their costs by hiring people at the training wage and laying off higher-paid workers.
