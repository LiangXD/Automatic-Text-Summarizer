a recommended halt to the government's "let it burn" forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the western fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium. "my guess is that the moratorium would be finished by the beginning of the western fire season, which is the middle of may," charles philpot, co-chairman of the review panel, told a news conference. the report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened. it said actual fire management plans often have not spelled out when natural fires would be allowed to burn and when they would be put out. the agencies involved should make sure that fire management plans conform to departmental policies, that employees understand the policies, that everybody is using a common vocabulary and that agencies have agreed beforehand what to do if fires threaten to move across administrative boundaries, the report said. "no... natural fires are to be allowed until fire management plans meet these standards," the report said. another recommendation called for the responsible agency official to "certify in writing daily that adequate resources are available to ensure" that every natural fire will be kept within boundaries set by government authorities.
