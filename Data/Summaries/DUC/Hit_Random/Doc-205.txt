seven thousand british and 4,000 french workers, on eight- to 12-hour shifts, have completed more than half of the job. the boring machines are fantastic: guided by satellite, gyroscope, computer and laser, these monsters, equipped with cuisinart-style blades more than 16 feet wide, can chop and shred chalk at about 15 feet an hour, or 650-1,000 feet a week. we only hear of other machines, such as a giant pump in a 230-foot shaft that sucks the spoil slurry out of the tunnel, but we get some more big figures for the notebooks: two thousand tons of spoil come out every hour 500 tons of material go in money, the press here reports, is being spent at a rate of $4.4 million a day. the 1986 treaty, which contains a clause prohibiting government subsidies for the tunnel, gave a 55-year concession to eurotunnel, an anglo-french partnership that commissioned trans manche link, a consortium of five english contractors (costain, wimpey, taylor woodrow, balfour beatty and tarmac) and five french (boygues, dumez, societe generale d'entreprise, societe auxiliaire d'entreprises, spie batignolles) to design and build the tunnel. in the same week that the french government revealed its plans to spend 190 billion francs ($34 billion) on expanding its high-speed rail network, the prime minister announced that there will be no government subsidy for a fast train between london and the tunnel, in effect shelving plans for a much discussed new 70-mile link between london and folkestone. we will become the butt of french jokes and be economically marginalized in europe. ) and travelers from france will have to adjust, perhaps by chewing gum rapidly, when they switch from the grande vitesse of the chemins de fer francais to the homely milk route of british rail, and sit out an extra half-hour until arrival at waterloo. despite the gift packs of french and english wine (more unfavorable comparisons) on sale just beneath the i dig the tunnel stickers at the eurotunnel exhibition centre, most britons seem to share, or will have to learn to live in regretful memory of, gladstone's view that england should be happy that the wise dispensation of providence has cut her off by that streak of silver sea... partly from dangers, absolutely from the temptations which attend upon the local neighbourhood of the continental nations.
