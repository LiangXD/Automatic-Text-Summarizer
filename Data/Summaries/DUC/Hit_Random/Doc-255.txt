rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts along the u.s.-canadian border, possibly triggering scattered showers in the extreme northern plains and upper mississippi valley. in addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the northern great plains and rocky mountains. and a separate climate assessment added that many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months. on tuesday, the agriculture department announced sharp reductions in the anticipated harvest of many crops because of the water shortage _ and those projections were based on the assumption of normal weather from here on, according to department officials. the drought region now extends well into west virginia and includes nearly all of ohio and indiana and much of kentucky and tennessee, the weather service drought advisory said. the drought has been accompanied by higher than normal temperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western great lakes region. in addition to thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-range outlook through july 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain hotter than normal, particularly the tennessee valley, lower midwest, central and northern great plains, northern rockies and great basin.
