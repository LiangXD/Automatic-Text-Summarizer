separate strong earthquakes rocked northern japan and the main philippine island of luzon today, swaying buildings and trees but apparently not causing any serious injuries or damage, officials said. the japanese quake registered a preliminary 5.2 on the richter scale and was the second strong temblor to hit the northern island of hokkaido in less than three days, central meteorological agency officials said. the philippine institute of volcanology and seismology said it was centered 110 miles northwest of manila under the luzon sea. both earthquakes also occurred in quake-prone areas where edges of the earth's crustal plates are thought to rub together, a central meteorological agency official said. the official said there was no way of knowing whether the japanese quake was related to the one in the philippines, 2,250 miles away. the philippine islands are thought to be located on the edge of a separate, smaller crustal plate which extends up to southern japan. in the past 35 years there have been two major earthquakes in hokkaido.
