hundreds of demonstrators blocked streets and train tracks today, halting most traffic in the capital to press their demands for president hussain muhammad ershad to resign. there were no reports of violence by midday. the blockade was the latest tactic in the campaign by opposition parties to force ershad to quit. at least eight people have been killed by police since the current round of protests started oct. 10. "we are happy to see that the blockade has turned into a hartal (general strike). this shows popular support for our cause," said suranjit sengupta, a top leader of the democratic party. he later resigned from the military and was elected president in 1986 in balloting that opposition parties, foreign diplomats and journalists said was rigged.
