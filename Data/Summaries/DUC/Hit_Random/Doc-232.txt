the proposed pact between the us, canada and mexico had the support of the republican establishment, of governor bill clinton, the prospective democratic nominee, of the powerful texas democrats on capitol hill and most of the democratic leadership in congress. the white house has taken its own polls and remains convinced that president bush's support for nafta is a winning issue. between retirements and election defeats, one-quarter to a one-third of the house could change, and no one can foresee the prevailing sentiment on trade issues. politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like mr harry freeman, executive director of the mtn coalition, believes the democrats will use nafta as a weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to mexico. a centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to the congress in may 1991, in which he committed himself to action on environmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance. it now has 200 signatories to a resolution, introduced by congressman henry waxman and majority leader richard gephardt, which warns that they will not support a nafta that does not have strong environment or food safety provisions. fifty-seven of the 200 signatories voted for the president's fast-track authority and now may be moving over on the issue.
