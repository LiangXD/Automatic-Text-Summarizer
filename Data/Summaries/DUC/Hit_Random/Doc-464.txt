as the sense of change becomes palpable - with china's citic taking the british trading company jardine matheson's seat on the board of the powerful jockey club, and mandarin beginning to displace cantonese on the government radio - it is now up to china to decide how smooth the handover will be, and the shape of life beyond. but china says an illegitimate 1995 legco cannot pass laws binding a future government. however, the basic law - the china-drafted mini-constitution for post-1997 hong kong - does not provide for a provisional legislature as such, although it does foresee a 'preparatory committee' to be formed in 1996 that will determine who sits in this legislature. however, the basic law - the china-drafted mini-constitution for post-1997 hong kong - does not provide for a provisional legislature as such, although it does foresee a 'preparatory committee' to be formed in 1996 that will determine who sits in this legislature. china's supporters in the colony claim that mr patten's policy is now to make hong kong harder to govern by 'loosening the screws' before the british leave. mr zhou nan, the most senior representative of the chinese communist party and government in hong kong, recently attacked mr patten's plans for a government-funded pension, saying: 'during the transition period, we should not casually transplant a costly euro-socialist pay-as-you-go concept to hong kong without prudently taking into consideration similar western programmes' long-standing track record of grossly under-estimating liabilities and grossly over-estimating funding projections.' the real issue is: how easy will it be (for china) to break?
