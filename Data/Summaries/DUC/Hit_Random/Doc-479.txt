backers of house legislation to raise the minimum wage lowered their target to $4.55 an hour on the eve of debate as president bush declared he had the votes to sustain a veto should congress go above $4.25. the democratic sponsors of the bill, scheduled for floor debate beginning today, also agreed tuesday to include a sub-minimum training wage in their measure, a 60-day proposal that falls far short of the six-month period demanded by bush. and the president, at a white house meeting with reporters, insisted he had made his best and last offer to raise the wage, which has been frozen for eight years. bush appeared with labor secretary elizabeth dole, who was there to deliver a letter from 35 republican senators who promised to side with bush should he veto minimum-wage legislation that fails to meet white house guidelines. "there's enough votes in our grasp here to see that we don't bust the budget and increase the pressures on inflation by going beyond that which the secretary and i have agreed on," bush said tuesday. the bill due for house debate today calls for raising the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1992 and has no provision for a sub-minimum training wage, an idea long opposed by the sponsors and organized labor, which has been lobbying heavily against such proposals. but the sponsors, facing mounting pressure from the white house and moderate democrats, agreed to scale back the final level to $4.55 and add a training wage in an amendment worked out tuesday that has the support of the house leadership.
