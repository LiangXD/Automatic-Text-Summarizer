the survival of a still-potent saddam hussein would be a problem not only for president bush but for many of america's chief allies, particularly israel. the announcement of the peace plan in moscow occurred only hours after saddam hussein had delivered a defiant speech in baghdad in which he seemed to dare the u.s. and its allies to launch a ground attack to drive his troops out of kuwait. what's more, officials suggest that they have hoped not only to drive his forces out of kuwait but also to deliver a death blow along the way to the elite republican guard that have been instrumental in keeping saddam hussein in power. for this reason, officials say the relentless allied bombardment of bridges crossing the tigris and euphrates rivers has been aimed not only at cutting supply lines but also at making it more difficult for the guards to escape with their heavy equipment to the north when fighting intensifies. saudi leaders, in particular, don't want the war to stop until saddam hussein is out of power because they must share a long, thinly guarded border with an iraq that even now could remain militarily more powerful than the thinly populated saudi kingdom. by presenting mr. bush with that choice, saddam hussein may not only be posing an agonizing decision but finally taking a step toward splitting the extraordinary international coalition that mr. bush built -- many of whose members will want to accept the iraqi withdrawal and declare victory. by presenting mr. bush with that choice, saddam hussein may not only be posing an agonizing decision but finally taking a step toward splitting the extraordinary international coalition that mr. bush built -- many of whose members will want to accept the iraqi withdrawal and declare victory.
