milken, 42, resigned thursday after 19 years at drexel, where he began a wildly successful career that helped reshape corporate america in the 1980s through the pioneering use of low-grade securities called junk bonds. a drexel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the wall street giant does not anticipate conflicts with milken's new firm because it will not be in the brokerage business. under drexel's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider trading and other fraud charges with the securities and exchange commission, drexel and its employees are barred from doing business with milken, directly or indirectly. the drexel official said the provision likely will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, so some contact between the new york investment firm's clients and milken may occur. his pitchman sale of the bonds _ previously used mainly by companies with low credit ratings _ helped fuel the decade's corporate takeover mania by giving smaller companies and corporate raiders a tool for financing growth, mergers and takeovers. but the federal government alleges milken used his powers through drexel to engage in a range of securities crimes, including schemes with now-jailed stock speculator ivan boesky. with milken's resignation, lawyers may argue that parts of the drexel pact are moot and mount further challenges.
