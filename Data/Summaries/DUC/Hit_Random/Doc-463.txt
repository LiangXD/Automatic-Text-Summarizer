beijing, february 26 (xinhua) -- the recent passage of hong kong governor chris patten's partial electoral bill by its legislative council (legco) was not accidental, but long premeditated. it is known to all that shortly after patten became hong kong governor in 1992, he began to sell his political bill step by step under the pretence of increasing democracy in hong kong, in an attempt to change hong kong's present political structure and pull the pro-british elements and those who are opposed to china onto the political stage, so as to turn hong kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity which cannot be controlled by the central government of china after 1997. however, patten hurriedly put forward his political reform bill less than three months after he began to serve as hong kong governor, without absorbing opinions from the hong kong residents. more serious was that, despite strong appeals from hong kong residents for the settlement of the electoral arrangements through talks, the political reform bill submitted by patten was passed. more serious was that, despite strong appeals from hong kong residents for the settlement of the electoral arrangements through talks, the political reform bill submitted by patten was passed. before the chinese and british sides reach an agreement on the arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the partial electoral bill passed by the british-hong kong legco or any other electoral bill possibly yet to be passed by the legco cannot remain beyond the year 1997. it would be a vain fantasy to think that the passed bill will be fixed in the form of law and the three-level bodies produced from the bill can be automatically extended beyond the year 1997.
