yet, state and federal minimum-wage comparisons should be made with a great deal of caution. furthermore, the district of columbia, like many states, has a subminimum, or training wage, of $3.35 for employees in some job categories who are under age 18. (some states also have subminimums based on age, student status, approved internship programs or for new hires.) another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05. yet the different minimum-wage levels to a large extent reflect regional variations in levels of unemployment and labor demand, as well as costs of living. typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living. wyoming's minimum of $1.60 would be meaningless, even laughable, in massachusetts, where most employers must pay well above the federal minimum wage to attract applicants for job openings.
