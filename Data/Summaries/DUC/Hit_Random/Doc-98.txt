the point at issue in senate debate on a new immigration bill was whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will reallocate house seats among states after the 1990 census. there could be enough of them to shift seats away from at least five states to sun belt states with large numbers of illegal residents. nobody is certain because counting illegal aliens is a hard thing to do, given the fact that they don't want to be spotted by the government. "a census of only legal residents cannot be done as accurately as a census of all residents," according to census bureau testimony to congress. the government made no attempt to count them out in the redistricting process indeed, the two previous administrations decided that the constitution required that the census cover illegal aliens along with citizens. the senate has passed an immigration bill including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the redistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear congress before the next year's national head count. shelby's amendment says only that the secretary is to "make such adjustments in total population figures as may be necessary, using such methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and appropriate" to keep illegal aliens from being counted in congressional reapportionment.
