nagib ghafoor said the suit was filed june 28 in u.s. district court in san francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 of the 290 victims. ghafoor said the lawsuit was filed against the general electric corp. "the company has not seen the suit yet, so it's inappropriate to comment," said jack batty, a company spokesman. pentagon analysts have said split-second decisions aboard the vincennes were affected by the inability of radar operators to immediately match the plane's radar trace with digital direction, altitude and speed information displayed on another screen. ghafoor said the complaint charged that the radar equipment indicated the aircraft approaching the vincennes was an f-14, diving in an attack mode at an altitude of 4,000 feet, rather than the iran air flight, which was climbing. he said claims against the united states on behalf of the families "are in the process of being filed as well." the iraqis said the ship was hit because the pilot of a mirage fighter-bomber mistook it for an iranian warship.
