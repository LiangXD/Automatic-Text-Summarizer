it is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced, rep. it boils down to regional politics, says arturo vargas, census-program director for the mexican american legal defense and educational fund, one of several hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants. richard shelby (d., ala.), says seats for connecticut, michigan, north carolina and alabama also are at risk. illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from americans, says david ray, spokesman for the federation for american immigration reform. the census bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the immigration and naturalization service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in california. to satisfy congressional critics, it would have to ask everyone that question, and then ask the legal status of anyone who isn't a citizen. the senate, by a vote of 58-41, added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract illegal immigrants when it comes up with figures used for reapportionment.
