lilongwe june 6 sapa -- three million people will need emergency food aid in 1994/95 following widespread crop failure in central and southern malawi, the united nations food aid organisation [fao] said on monday [6 june]. this year's cereal production among smallholders is estimated to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest, and only 28 per cent higher than in 1991/92, when drought devasted southern africa. the mission estimated about 493,000 tons of cereals would have to be imported. of the cereal food aid requirement, about 175,000 tons would be needed as emergency assistance for some three million people. we attach equal importance to keeping the commercial sector well-supplied, said wfp director phillip ostenso. despite a bumper harvest last year, malawi has not recovered from the massive 1991/92 drought. malnutrition rates have always been very high in malawi, even with good harvests.
