las vegas, a desert town of 5,600 little more than five decades ago, is growing at the rate of 3,000 people a month and there are now about 700,000 people in the region. las vegas is one of only 15 u.s. cities that can provide the hotel rooms and exhibit space for a southern baptist convention, said alvin c. shackleford, a convention spokesman. "the choice of las vegas was deliberate in that the southern baptist convention hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in las vegas," said stan hastey, executive director of the southern baptist alliance, a moderate group. a series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign saturday in which about 2,000 southern baptists were expected knock on doors around las vegas. "las vegas is probably no more notorious in its pagan qualities than any other city," hastey said. robert powers, a spokesman for the las vegas convention and visitors authority, said life in the residential areas outside the strip is little different from anywhere else. robert powers, a spokesman for the las vegas convention and visitors authority, said life in the residential areas outside the strip is little different from anywhere else.
