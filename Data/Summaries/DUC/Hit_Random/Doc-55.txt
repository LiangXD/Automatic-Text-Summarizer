it appears that what we have here is something of a trojan horse -- a piece of legislation that is represented as reform when all it does is expand existing welfare programs. they point out that part of the money will go for special education, training and work programs for welfare mothers, to induce them off the rolls and into jobs. but less than a quarter of the $5.2 billion outlay would go for that purpose. in short, the family welfare reform act amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo. together, spending for the seven major welfare programs (those just mentioned plus the women, infants and children program and the low income energy assistance program) has actually increased since 1970 by 232% in constant dollars, to an annual total $65.7 billion. it is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the family welfare reform act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency. earlier this year, there were hopeful signs that we would see sweeping, serious welfare-reform legislation emerge from congress.
