at a just-concluded session in madrid, spain, 39 nations reached a tentative compromise on updating the antarctica treaty. washington, dragging its feet all the way, needs steady pressure to accept the compromise. while other nations -- including japan, germany and new zealand -- pushed for a permanent ban on commercial exploitation, u.s. and british delegates held out for a short moratorium. next month, the original antarctica treaty will celebrate its 30th anniversary. what better way to honor a model international agreement than to continue its tradition of preserving antarctica for scientific research, and keeping it off-limits to military bases, commercial development and mining. the earth endows us with a wealth worth vastly more than the artificial commodity value of its resources. it may turn out that preserving antarctica will reap humankind more benefits than the yield from digging up and selling off all its gold, silver and oil.
