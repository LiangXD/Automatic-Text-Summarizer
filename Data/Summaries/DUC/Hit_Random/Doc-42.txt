in hawaii, mauna loa erupted for the first time in six years, stunning scientists by releasing a dazzling fountain of lava at the height of the eclipse. the world will not see such a long-lasting eclipse for another 151 years. the view was diminished for many in hawaii and mexico, where low cloud cover obscured the celestial display. at the astronomy observatory at the top of 13,800-foot mauna kea, high cirrus clouds thwarted three of the 10 scientific experiments. in the bay area, though, mostly sunny skies made eclipse watching a treat, except along the coast, where it was obscured by fog. more than a hundred sun gazers showed up at the branham lane park in south san jose with almost as many gizmos to help them spot sunspots and watch the moon cross the sun. more than 500 astronomers and tens of thousands of amateurs flocked to the islands to sell nearly everything under the sun.
