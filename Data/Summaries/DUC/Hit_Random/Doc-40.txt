because of variations in the moon's orbit, fewer than a third of the solar eclipses are total eclipses. at its peak, observers will see one of the longest-lasting eclipses this century -- six minutes, 53 seconds. at its peak, observers will see one of the longest-lasting eclipses this century -- six minutes, 53 seconds. also, its 150-mile-wide path across hawaii, baja california, mexico city and four central american capital cities puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history, says alan dyer, an editor of astronomy magazine. for one thing, chasing eclipses by trekking to remote regions with delicate astronomical instruments to capture a few minutes of data has lost much of its glamour, especially in times of tight budgets. and, unlike most people headed for hawaii, astronomers will be packing long underwear and down jackets in case, as sometimes happens even in july, the temperature at the summit drops below freezing. (the keck observatory, being built by the university of california and the california institute of technology, is behind its original construction schedule and will not be completed in time for the eclipse.)
