a single round of treatment with an experimental new medicine appears to be highly effective against a rare form of leukemia and may help fight other kinds of blood cancer as well, says a study published today. the new drug was developed at scripps clinic and research foundation in la jolla, calif., where doctors tested it on patients with hairy cell leukemia. doctors are also testing the drug against chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-hodgkins lymphoma and cutaneous t cell lymphoma. the scripps doctors concluded that the medicine, called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-cda, "may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia." the doctors cautioned that longer follow-up will be necessary before they can be sure they have actually cured the disease. two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed in recent years. they are interferon and deoxycoformycin, a drug that is similar to 2-cda.
