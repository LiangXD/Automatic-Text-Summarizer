nearly one-quarter of 650 officers responding to a commission survey agreed that racial bias on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and community, and in some cases may lead to the use of excessive force, the report said. yet supervisors made no effort to monitor or control these messages, evidence of a significant breakdown in the department's management responsibility, the report found. but the commission called for a shift away from the force's paramilitaristic, us-against-them style, and said the department must embrace the community-based policing style that encourages officers to spend less time in their cars and more time interacting with citizens in the communities they serve. as troubling as some of our findings are... they are not unique to los angeles, said john a. arguelles, vice chairman of the 10-member independent commission on the los angeles police department. of the six largest police departments in the u.s., the nation's second largest city has the fewest officers per thousand residents. however, michael yamaki, one of the city's five police commissioners, believes that given the systemic problems in the department that have come to light, citizens now will be more willing to fund police issues. however, michael yamaki, one of the city's five police commissioners, believes that given the systemic problems in the department that have come to light, citizens now will be more willing to fund police issues.
