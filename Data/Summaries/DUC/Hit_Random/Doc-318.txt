milken was somewhat vague about exactly what the new firm will do or how many people it will employ. he also declined to speculate on whether he might try to expand the firm to offer full-scale investment banking services if he should succeed in overcoming the criminal and civil charges facing him. milken, who earned amounts ranging up to $550 million per year at drexel, over the last year has attempted to help arrange financing for unions and workers seeking to take over troubled companies. some observers have viewed this as part of an overall public relations campaign at a time when he is in trouble. i think michael is desperate to find something to do, a former drexel colleague said. a number of milken's former colleagues at drexel already have been granted immunity from prosecution and are cooperating with the government investigation. sources confirmed thursday that another former drexel employee, reed harmon, who had worked closely with milken, was recently granted immunity in exchange for testimony before a grand jury.
