"It's a beautiful thing," Fujita said.Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, but are more dangerous because they give pilots less time to react, Fujita said.Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado.He also developed the Fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes."In Texas one time, five people were killed when they drove right into a tornado.But Fujita considers his work on other air movements called downbursts and microbursts among his most significant achievements."Tornadoes are very rare in Japan," Fujita said.Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research.Fujita retires from teaching this year, but will continue his research at the university.Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953, partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country.Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982.When he saw his first tornado, he and a team of scientists were studying wind shear and its effect on aircraft.The National Transportation Safety Board has cited microbursts, a term coined by Fujita, as the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in the last 15 years, causing 577 fatalities.
