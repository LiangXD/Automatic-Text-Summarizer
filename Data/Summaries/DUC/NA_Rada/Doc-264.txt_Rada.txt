Abimael Guzman, founder of the rebel movement, has said of the slums and their people: "The immense masses of the shantytowns are like belts of steel that lock in the enemy and hold back his reactionary forces."The highway ties Lima to the agricultural lands of the central Andes and Peru's most important mines, where unions threatened by the Shining Path have conducted a strike since late October that costs millions of dollars a day in export earnings.Huaycan is one of the slums where Shining Path works hardest because it is just off the Central Highway, a strategic route through the capital's main industrial zone to the mountains.Shining Path has infiltrated 167 unions and neighborhood associations in the Lima slums this year, says a confidential Interior Ministry report obtained by The Associated Press.Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains eight years ago, are moving into the shantytowns that encircle the capital like a noose.Guerrillas threaten and sometimes kill community leaders, establish "people's schools" and set up "street theaters" for propaganda, it said.In July, the pro-Shining Path newspaper El Diario published a 48-page report on the guerrilla movement.Guzman's guerrillas have followed tens of thousands of peasants from the Andes into Lima's shantytowns and see the slums as a new stronghold.Shining Path's move into a more public role, and through most of Peru from its Andean base in Ayacucho province, has coincided with economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2,000 percent.
