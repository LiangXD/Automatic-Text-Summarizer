However, Mr Daley, by pushing Nafta, runs the risk of alienating his union supporters.However, Mr Daley's appointment to chair the White House's task force on the North America Free Trade Agreement is not a cosy political payoff.Mr Daley accepted the Nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet position and turning down an offer to be Mr Clinton's chief negotiator at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva.Mr Clinton may be banking on Mr Daley's union ties to help the Nafta effort.Opposition to Nafta comes from core Democratic constituencies, making it a potential political pothole for Mr Clinton.Mr Daley's talents have been summoned, insiders say, to convince moderate Democrats to back the agreement.By rough count, Mr Daley will have to marshall 73 votes from Democratic representatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement: those along the border with Mexico and those with big agricultural, consumer product, or manufacturing export interests.
