This doesn't mean that the American people support Judge Thomas -- or Robert Bork or Ronald Reagan -- in every detail of their political beliefs.The attack on Clarence Thomas, which boggled tens of millions of viewing Americans, makes sense only if one understands that the roots of the struggle extend back to 1980 and Ronald Reagan's election to the presidency.Washington's reporters, who had already largely broken away from the editorial controls of traditional journalism, even broke away from the congressional staffs and special-interest groups, building the sexual harassment story into a bonfire of personal and political grievances.But history will note that at the moment Clarence Thomas was about to be destroyed by the old order, the American people came forward and by the millions confirmed his appointment to the Supreme Court.It looks to us as if Clarence Thomas is the first Justice to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court with a popular mandate.The difference, however, between the American people and the permanent political establishment in Washington is that Washington no longer feels constrained by the American political system.We don't doubt, however, that in terms of the presidency or the Supreme Court, voters are willing to risk disappointment on discrete issues if they approve the fundamental direction.
