The jet, which can hold at least 100 passengers, carried 20 passengers and a crew of two pilots and three flight attendants.Airlines have been slashing their flight schedules and laying off employees because of the downturn.The crash comes at a particularly sensitive time for the travel industry.Although it has always been difficult to measure the effect of crashes on travel, this accident comes just as people were starting to get over fears of terrorism related to the Persian Gulf war.Moments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23 miles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, Mr. Hall said.The last major U.S. wind shear accident occurred in Dallas in 1985, when a Delta Air Lines jet crashed on approach.
