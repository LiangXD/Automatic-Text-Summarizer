As amended, the House bill would boost the minimum wage to $3.85 an hour on Oct.The House voted 248-171 Thursday in favor of legislation that would raise the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October 1991, with the first increase taking effect later this year.House passage of a plan to raise the minimum wage shifts the partisan battle to the Senate, where the leading proponent of an increase is urging President Bush to refrain from further veto threats while Congress settles on a final bill.Several Republicans insisted that Democrats were going to have to give in to Bush _ who appears to have the votes to sustain a veto _ or let a ninth year pass without any change in the minimum wage.
