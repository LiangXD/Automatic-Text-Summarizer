Nevertheless, it was a very important and unexpected police coup against the Shining Path -- one that probably could have brought dramatic results if President Alan Garcia had not decided to make public the operation so soon after the first police intervention, in order to score a quick propaganda gain.His campaign pitch advocated an approach closely resembling that of Mr. Garcia's first year.At first, he tried a liberal approach, looking for a dialogue with the fanatical Shining Path, and sending scores of young professionals to the emergency areas to attack what he said were the "root causes" of the insurgency.Midpoint during his term, Mr. Garcia lost all hope of defeating the Shining Path, and decided just to coexist with it, says Rafael Merino, a respected analyst on security matters.The Shining Path went to war in 1980, on the same day Peru was holding general elections after 12 years of a military dictatorship.This is only wishful thinking, according to Mr. Merino: "If President Fujimori thinks he'll finish the war through those 'pacification' policies, it will be like riding into battle with no better dress or weapons than a tuxedo."LIMA -- On June 4, I was among a group of journalists who were told that the war against the Shining Path ("Sendero Luminoso") guerrillas had almost been won.In October 1981, emergency laws were imposed for the first time on part of Peru; they covered only 2% of the population.In 10 years, the war between the Shining Path and the government has cost about 20,000 lives.This impulsiveness gave full warning to the guerrillas' entire clandestine apparatus, allowing them to limit considerably the damage inflicted on them. </LP> <TEXT> As Alberto Fujimori prepares to take over as Peru's next president on July 28, the question of whether the Shining Path will hound his administration as it has the previous two ranks high among his concerns.
