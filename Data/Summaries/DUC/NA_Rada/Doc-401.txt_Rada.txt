Terry Anderson's daughter pleaded for the father she loves but has never known to come home today, the day Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in Lebanon.Former hostages chained themselves to a tree in Paris to protest Anderson's captivity, and President Bush pledged to work for the hostages' release.Lebanese newspapers also published a letter today signed "Sulome and Madeleine," from the girl and her mother, Madeleine Bassil, who wait in Cyprus for Anderson's release.Bush did not attend the ceremony, but said in a radio interview that "every day I'm President I have a heavy heart when I think of the hostages."Thank you," said Sulome, who was born 83 days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim faction in Beirut.In a videotape, Anderson's 4-year-old daughter Sulome appeared, wearing a green coat and riding a bicycle given to her at Christmas in Anderson's name.Directing her remarks to the captors of her brother thousands of miles away, she said: "You complain that your story has not been told and yet the man who would tell it has been chained to a basement wall for five years. . . .A home without a husband or father is not a home, it's hell," the letter said.Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, is the longest-held of the American hostages in Lebanon.
