Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as a weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to Mexico.The White House has taken its own polls and remains convinced that President Bush's support for Nafta is a winning issue.His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs, and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congress to vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Nafta approved by Congress this year.
