While defense attorneys wouldn't say what they thought of the prosecutor's actions, other lawyers connected indirectly to the case scored Reiner for allegedly using the case and his changing views on Keating's bail to bolster his public image.At the same time, Klausner reduced bail for three Keating co-defendants from the $1 million he imposed Tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the former operators of American Continental Corp. and its former main subsidiary, Lincoln.Ira Reiner, whose office has flip-flopped twice in its bail recommendations in the case, praised the decision not to reduce Keating's bail.Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner said Keating -- pursued by creditors, regulators and prosecutors for his role in the failure of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan -- has "significant reasons not to stay around."Afterwards, Donald Smaltz, attorney for Symes, criticized Reiner and Klausner for their handling of the bail hearing.Klausner also said he was "troubled" by the way the district attorney has equivocated on the bail issue.A Los Angeles judge Friday refused to reduce the $5-million bail for Charles H. Keating Jr., saying the Phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations.Klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper bail, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing were the most important in this case.The ruling means that the 66-year-old Keating -- a once-wealthy real estate developer, lawyer and influential political campaign contributor used to pin-striped suits -- will spend more time in blue prison fatigues inside Los Angeles County Jail.Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to investigate Lincoln, said he was willing to let the defendants go without bail on Tuesday because he didn't want to face a difficult battle extraditing Keating from Arizona.The judge's decision came after 1 1/2 days of testimony and arguments in the first criminal case to be filed in connection with the collapses of Lincoln and Phoenix-based American Continental.Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, indicated he would appeal Klausner's ruling.After Klausner first ruled, Reiner said he then supported the bail set."Mr. Keating is accused of cheating people out of their savings," Reiner said in a press conference after the hearing.They also argued that the indictment contains no information about specific wrongdoing, alleging only violations of certain laws regarding the sale of American Continental debt securities at Lincoln offices to 20 people.Bail is supposed to assure a defendant's appearance in court and must be within the means he could reasonably afford."Bail for Judy J. Wischer, 42, former American Continental president, was lowered to $200,000.
