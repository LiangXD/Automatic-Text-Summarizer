California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages.Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05.Compare these unemployment rates to those of Alabama and Louisiana, states that have no minimum wage.Last year alone, nine states and the District of Columbia raised their minimum wage above the current federal level, and this year New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are considering doing the same.Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living.Moreover, 13 states have minimums below the federal level and nine have no minimum at all.The advantage of allowing state or regional differences in minimum-wage levels is that the appropriate minimum wage for Connecticut might force massive layoffs in Texas.
