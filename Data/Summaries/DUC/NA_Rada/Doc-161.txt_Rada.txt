Ben Johnson spent his homecoming in seclusion, without the Olympic gold medal and the hero's welcome, as Canadians bemoaned the fate of the sprinter who failed the drug test.I know it," said his father, Ben Johnson Sr., from Falmouth, Jamaica, in an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail."There's no gold now, just disappointment," said Boyd Plaxton, 26, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, one of 200 people on hand when Johnson's plane landed.Returning to Canada on Tuesday, Johnson, 26, dodged reporters and the public, refusing to talk about the muscle-building and illegal steroid Stanzolol found in his system after he won the 100-meter dash as the world's fastest human.Johnson had dedicated his gold to his mother, Gloria, and the Canadian people."I got nothing to hide," Johnson told The Boston Globe during the flight to New York, where he then boarded another plane for Canada."It's not the only thing in life to win a gold medal," Johnson said.Stripped of the gold and banned for life from Canadian teams, Johnson cried in the back of a limousine that whisked him to his mother's home in suburban Toronto after the grueling trip from Seoul.
