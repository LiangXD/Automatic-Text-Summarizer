Patten said, "When many places in the world identify with Hong Kong's value system and seek to duplicate its success story, would the world become a better place, a more prosperous place?Even more striking is the open dialogue and debate that took place in an atmosphere of freedom between Patten and the people of Hong Kong on an equal plane after the governor presented his second annual report (in which the Chinese authorities also played an active part).(Section 182) Patten took the initiative to define the relations between China and Hong Kong, giving substance to their contacts as well as clarifying the nature of such relations.The people of Hong Kong might blame the Chinese Government for the delay in solving all those problems that need to be tackled urgently.(Section 174) "The reason is that we still have not been able to convince Chinese officials that Hong Kong citizens' expectations about the development of their political system are in no way excessive but are reasonable and should be met, that they form part of the natural evolution of a society as it matures and becomes more sophisticated.7. In his annual report to the Legislative Council, Patten noted subtly and not so subtly that where Hong Kong was free to make up its mind, things had gone well in the past year, but where consultation with China was necessary, nothing seemed to have worked well.3. Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council is replete with praises for the people of Hong Kong, for their accomplishments, and for the superiority of the Hong Kong system, calling it a miracle of human society.The Chinese wavered on the "through train" idea and the British came up with their own set of arrangements for the 1995 elections.1. Abandoning his "from politics to politics" stance, which is that politics is self-justifying and self-sufficient, Patten has now woven politics into the lives of the people of Hong Kong, making it part and parcel of the local way of life and inseparable from the war on corruption, the rule of law, freedom, education, and the quality of governance -- all "perennial concerns" in Chinese society. [passage omitted]Now that Patten has made politics an integral part of the life of the Hong Kong people and their institutions, can the Chinese continue to counter it with the argument that it is all a matter of trust between nations?If, on the other hand, it echoes Patten and begins heaping praises on Hong Kong and emulating the Hong Kong system, can the Chinese Government bring itself to do that?Patten makes endless allusions to what is good about the Hong Kong system and what is bad about the Chinese system, one obvious example being the way the two governments level with the people.A unilateral emphasis on China's sovereignty would result in integration of a regressive type, meaning that an advanced Hong Kong would have to reach down to accommodate a backward China.After Patten came to Hong Kong, the Chinese could no longer keep acting anti-democratic.As for making the Hong Kong system "living, automatic, and autonomous," the relations between China and the special entity of Hong Kong, how the two should be integrated and to what extent, as well as the costs and benefits of such integration... none of that has been considered at length."...outstanding achievements have been scored on all fronts during the past year...with one lone exception," which was Hong Kong's effort to "further its understanding with China" and "replace unproductive speculation with sincere trust."The kind of Sino-Hong Kong relations China wants is one in which Hong Kong complies with all China's orders and satisfies every Chinese demand.China has always looked at Hong Kong unilaterally from top to bottom, demanding that it fall in line with China and not the other way round.It is hard for the Chinese to sing the praises of the Hong Kong system, Hong Kong people, and Hong Kong society.Would praising Hong Kong send a wrong message to the local people, misleading them into thinking that China would compromise with Patten and go along with him?What Patten said about Hong Kong's values and its superiority were all satirized by the Chinese media, so much so that one could hardly tell right from wrong anymore.A dozen or so public opinion surveys by the Hong Kong Statistical and Business Research Council invariably came up with one finding: The people of Hong Kong want both sides to make concessions and reach an accord.One year after arriving in Hong Kong, Patten has certainly commanded much authority with his solid political ideas.Now Patten takes life in Hong Kong as his point of departure, arguing that democratic politics of a high quality are what the people of Hong Kong need to maintain the "Hong Kong system."Of course this is the stock in trade of politicians in every democratic country, but it also shows that the relationship between the ruler and the ruled under a democratic system is just what the people of Hong Kong need psychologically at this point in time.
