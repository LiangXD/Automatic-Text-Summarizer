Japanese billionaire Masao Nangaku, who bought the Dunes Hotel and Casino two years ago for $157 million, is planning a 35-story high-rise office building and 300-room nongaming hotel in downtown Las Vegas."More than half the Japanese tourists who come to Los Angeles will also come to Las Vegas," said Yoshi Morichika, who is heading up a 1,274-acre golf and destination resort community for Japanese recreation and electronics giant Cosmo World.Japanese businessman Katsuki Manabe, who owns more than 30 arcades in Tokyo, has invested $30 million in the Park Hotel in downtown Las Vegas and millions more in his Nevada-based Sigma Games, a gaming equipment maker.Don Woodsmall, who serves with Morichika as project manager of the Cosmo World project, said Las Vegas was picked by the Japanese company, in part, "because the housing market is so strong here."Izumi, who looked at properties in Hawaii but opted for Las Vegas because of the lower costs, has committed $30 million for the purchase and renovation of the hotel.Snow is seeking a new site for the project because some landowners in downtown Las Vegas balked at selling their property.The growing identity of Las Vegas in Japan, bargain real estate prices, a good economic climate and the attractiveness of the city are proving a magnet for Japanese investors.When Nangaku bought the Dunes Hotel two years ago, his attorney predicted other Japanese businessmen would follow.
