The administration guidelines include raising the minimum wage, now at $3.35 an hour, to $4.25 an hour by 1992, provided employers can pay new hires a "training wage" of $3.35 an hour for six months."For eight years this same coalition of Republican senators has blocked any increase in the minimum wage," said Sen.The bill due for House debate today calls for raising the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1992 and has no provision for a sub-minimum training wage, an idea long opposed by the sponsors and organized labor, which has been lobbying heavily against such proposals.The training wage would initially be $3.35 an hour but would increase to 85 percent of the subsequent increases in the minimum wage.The Democratic sponsors of the bill, scheduled for floor debate beginning today, also agreed Tuesday to include a sub-minimum training wage in their measure, a 60-day proposal that falls far short of the six-month period demanded by Bush.
