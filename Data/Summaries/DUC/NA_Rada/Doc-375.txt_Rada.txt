The Bay Area quake suggested that Tokyo too may be much more vulnerable than experts had thought. </P> <P> For this and other reasons, Tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. </P> <P> A study last year by Japan's National Land Agency concluded that if a great earthquake -- magnitude 8 or greater -- should strike Tokyo in the middle of the night it would kill about 80,000 people.Okada directs a research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. </P> <P> Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations beneath Japan are constantly active. </P> <P> The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the planet.Two of the plates sink beneath the islands of Japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the Earth directly below Tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. </P> <P> Most other earthquake-prone regions, including California, only have to worry about two colliding plates. </P> <P> The threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is being reclaimed from Tokyo Bay to serve the needs of millions more who are flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity.Is that also a special case?" </P> <P> Although he thinks the question needs more study, Iemura is troubled by the fact that much of Tokyo is built on areas similar to San Francisco's Marina District. </P> <P> And like San Francisco, Tokyo is extremely short of land on which to build the high rises needed to house the millions who continue to flock to this crowded city. </P> <P> The answer to the land shortage, Japanese authorities have concluded, is to reclaim more land from Tokyo Bay -- a prospect that deeply troubles many experts.He has concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. </P> <P> Most experts here had thought that Mexico City was an "exceptional case," Iemura said.And now, all these years later, Iemura and many other experts in Japan are afraid that history may repeat itself. </P> <P> "We are very afraid of fire," said Etsuzo Shima, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and one of Japan's leading earthquake experts."If we had understood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the damages from the Great Kanto Earthquake which came just 17 years later could have been avoided," says Hirokazu Iemura of Kyoto University's Earthquake Engineering Laboratory. </P> <P> Iemura, who toured the Bay Area after last October's quake, is afraid history may repeat itself.Earthquakes occur chiefly in areas where giant slabs of the Earth's crust, called tectonic plates, either grind past each other or crunch together in a process called "subduction" that forces one plate under another. </P> <P> Japan, however, has to concern itself with four plates.
