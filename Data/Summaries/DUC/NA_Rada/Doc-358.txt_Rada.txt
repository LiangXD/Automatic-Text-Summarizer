Since Mr. Bush has just succeeded in turning the U.N. into a useful instrument for enhancing world order, he can't let Saddam Hussein steal his success.Even though the Bush administration's response to the new challenge has been mysteriously slow and inept, Saddam Hussein's most recent depredations have killed his last chance to plead for "magnanimity in victory," or to posture himself as the "lesser evil," who would, at least, give us the blessings of "stability" in Iraq.The U.S. is committed to support the U.N., and the U.N. is now committed to inserting itself deeply into the internal affairs of Iraq.If international security guarantees were to fail in this instance, the deal that could be offered to Israel would no longer be "territory for peace," but territory for a worthless U.N. document.Between the invasion of Kuwait last August and the end of the Gulf war, many brave souls inside and outside the U.S. government worried about clever stratagems that Saddam Hussein might employ to defeat the U.S.Saddam Hussein may not realize it, but as he begins to obstruct, violate and sabotage the U.N. implementation of the ceasefire agreement, he must take on not just some bureaucrats at U.N. headquarters and the U.N. flag.It will also determine the final winner in the contest between George Bush and Saddam Hussein. --- Mr. Ikle, now with the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies in Washington, D.C., was Undersecretary of Defense in the Reagan Defense Department.When Saddam Hussein is told to hand to the U.N. a list of all his prohibited weapons as a first step in complying with the ceasefire, he might well respond by arguing: (1) Iraq never had any of these weapons, (2) if it had, American bombing raids have destroyed every one of them, and (3) if there were remaining weapons, all records have been burned by Kurdish terrorists.
