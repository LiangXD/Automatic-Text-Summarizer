During the sentencing, Wood derided defense claims that Milken was basically law-abiding and that if he were not, he would have committed more blatant crimes, such as insider trading.October 1990: Special two-week hearing to consider the government's array of charges against Milken, ordered by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to gain greater insight into Milken's character in order to fashion a fair sentence for the six counts he admitted.At Liman's request, the judge agreed to sentence Milken under a provision of federal law that allows him to be paroled at any time at the discretion of the federal parole commission.Wood said evidence presented during a pre-sentencing hearing in October convinced her that Milken had committed additional serious crimes beyond the six felony counts he pleaded guilty to in April.April 24, 1990: Milken tearfully pleads guilty to six felonies, agrees to pay $600 million in restitution and fines, and agrees to cooperate with the government after sentencing.Several lawyers said they interpreted the long sentence as an attempt by the judge to ensure that Milken cooperates fully, revealing whatever incriminating information he knows about corporate raiders, junk bond buyers and former co-workers.John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor, said the judge may also have imposed the severe sentence because Milken occupied a position of trust at the center of the financial world.U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said the unexpectedly long prison term is meant to make an example of the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king, whose innovative use of high-yield, high-risk bonds had fueled the corporate takeover frenzy of the 1980s.The judge said she would consider reducing the sentence if prosecutors eventually certify to her that Milken has cooperated fully.Wood also sentenced him to three years of community service while on probation after his prison sentence.James Slade, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons, said that under Justice Department rules, the 10-year term makes it unlikely that Milken will be allowed to serve his sentence in a minimum-security federal prison camp.June 15, 1989: Milken resigns after 19 years at Drexel to form his own consulting firm.Wood's sentence was viewed as a rebuff to many prominent Southern Californians who had written to her urging that Milken's sentence be limited to community service.April 13, 1989: Drexel and the SEC announce a settlement of the government 's civil fraud case against the firm that subjects Drexel to federal monitoring for three years and forces it to sever ties with Milken.Under federal court rulings, Wood is allowed to consider evidence of other crimes in deciding on a sentence.Although Milken technically could be paroled almost immediately, government lawyers said the commission normally requires prisoners to serve close to two-thirds of their sentence.She said the government also did not prove its claim that Milken was guilty of insider trading in Caesars World securities in 1983, and also failed to show that he had illegally made lucrative investment opportunities available to employees of investment funds as inducements to get them to buy riskier securities for their funds.A federal judge sentenced an apparently stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in prison Wednesday after ruling that the crimes he pleaded guilty to were neither minor nor isolated.Milken had pleaded guilty to six felony securities law violations last April.FALL OF THE JUNK BOND KING Here is a chronology of key developments in the prosecution of former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. high-yield bond chief Michael Milken:The judge also rejected longstanding defense claims that Milken's crimes were aberrations by a generally law-abiding man and that they were the result of overzealousness to help clients rather than greed.Charles Carberry, a lawyer who once headed the U.S. attorney's securities fraud unit in New York, said: "I think it was a clear message that he should cooperate."In Milken's case, that would be about six years.The judge said she based the sentence only on evidence of specific crimes presented in court.A Milken spokesman said that no decision had been made on whether to appeal the sentence.21, 1990: Milken is sentenced to 10 years in jail, plus three years' probation, plus 1,800 hours of community service.The six counts that Milken pleaded guilty to included conspiracy, securities fraud, causing the filing of false information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, mail fraud and aiding in the filing of a false tax return.The sentence exceeds all others imposed in the series of securities fraud cases that grew out of the insider trading case against investment banker Dennis B. Levine in 1986.The judge left open the possibility of reducing the sentence if Milken cooperates with the government.21, 1988: Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the biggest securities fraud probe in history.The sentencing capped the most massive securities fraud investigation ever carried out by the government.
