Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knocked off track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids, says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance.However, the flamboyant, pony-tailed Lewis told reporters: "I don't understand why Ben Johnson's here."Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented the legislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlled substance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin.Lewis dismissed reporters' questions that he had used steroids, indicating he would be willing to run against Johnson "if he comes back and he's clean."
