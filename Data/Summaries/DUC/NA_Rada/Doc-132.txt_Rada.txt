Among the men, Paul Davies-Hale of England proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever.Following him, and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the Soviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British Midlands, who was third in 2:13:37.Davies-Hale caught the second pack at 13 miles and met up with pre-race favorite Steve Binns, who lives 30 miles from Davies-Hale in England's West Midlands.In the women's race, Weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with that handicapping.After a week of summer-like weather, race organizers hoped to be salvaged by a good race; to have, if not impressive times on this flat and fast course, at least a memorable race."I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went," Davies-Hale said.At 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun.It was the same spot, the corner of Wells and North Avenue, that Weidenbach had taken the lead in last year's race.Still, Davies-Hale is unsure what his future in the marathon is.She took off in Sunday's race with authority and ran with a 20-30-second cushion for 15 miles.Men's and women's winners won $50,000, second place won $30,000 and third place $20,000. . . ."I've already had a great track season," Davies-Hale said.Ann Cody Morris won the women's wheelchair race in 1:58:51.Given the heat, the humidity and the wind, Weidenbach's time might have been as much as two minutes faster.Marathon Notes Race organizers insist that this race is at a world-class level, especially pointing to the world's richest purse.Mother Nature conspired against this struggling marathon Sunday, serving up balmy, windy weather and wilting both the men's and women's fields.It was the slowest winning time in this race since 1982.
