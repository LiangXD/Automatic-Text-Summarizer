But drought aid cut farmers' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a North Dakota State University study found.Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley, was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance.About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms in Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres.Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into Iowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said.Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the state still needs "a good year to get back on our feet," Hauck said."I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area," Grindberg added.Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other drought-ravaged states, including Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin."It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster," said Dwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist.Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been just $6,300.Good crops the next two years started to reverse the trend, but drought stalled the recovery.A study of the $3.9 billion disaster relief program, conducted by The Associated Press over seven months, found that outside the Midwest drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousands of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious than the normal trials of nature.Two reasons why: more acres of wheat were planted this year, and farmers don't have grain reserves to sell at high prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden.Grindberg, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mail part-time, thinks the government last year "pushed he panic button on this disaster thing and went too far.
