I'm here today to explain to the people of Iraq why the United States and the world community has responded the way it has to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.The United Nations has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish the Iraqi people, but as a peaceful means to convince your leadership to withdraw from Kuwait.I do not believe that you, the people of Iraq, want war.Saddam Hussein tells you the occupation of Kuwait will benefit the poorer nations of the world.Iraq must get out of Kuwait -- for the sake of principle, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the Iraqi people.But even worse, others are being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.Because of Iraq's aggression, hundreds of thousands of innocent foreign workers are fleeing Kuwait and Iraq.Ultimately, Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait.No one knows what Iraq might be today, what prosperity and peace you might enjoy had your leaders not plunged you into war.When we stand with Kuwait against aggression, we stand for a principle well understood in the Arab world.In fact, the occupation of Kuwait is helping no one and is now hurting you, the Iraqi people, and countless others of the world's poor.2, your leadership made its decision to invade, an unprovoked attack on a small nation that posed no threat to your own.And the world met Iraq's invasion with a chorus of condemnation, unanimous resolutions in the United Nations.Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and America.I do not want to add to the suffering of the people of Iraq.Twenty-seven states, rich and poor, Arab, Muslim, Asian and African, have answered the call of Saudi Arabia and free Kuwait and sent forces to the gulf region to defend against Iraq.Here is the text of President Bush's address to the people of Iraq, as released by the White House:
