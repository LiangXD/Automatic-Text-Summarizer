A naval commander who had observed the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf said the ship had "no good reason" for shooting down an Iranian civilian airliner, killing all 290 aboard.Carlson, commander of the USS Sides, a frigate that was on the scene when the USS Vincennes shot down the Airbus on July 3, 1988, clearly put the blame on actions taken by the ship and disputed any notion of self-defense."Commander Carlson's comments in the magazine article are his personal opinions of the Airbus incident," he said.William M. Fogarty, who headed the Navy's investigating team, said the captain of the Vincennes, Will Rogers III, ordered the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken belief the airliner was an Iranian F-14 fighter plane."The Vincennes saw an opportunity for action, and pressed hard for Commander Middle East Force to give permission to fire," Carlson said.On the day of the incident, Carlson said, a crewman informed him that the Vincennes had classified the plane as an Iranian F-14 fighter.
