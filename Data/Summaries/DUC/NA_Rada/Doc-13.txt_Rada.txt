Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said.In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia.The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small.
