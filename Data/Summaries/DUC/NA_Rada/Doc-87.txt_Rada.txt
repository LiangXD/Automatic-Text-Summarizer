Effective drugs to combat tuberculosis cost about $30 to $50 per person, given over six months.Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday.In the United States, public health officials began to recognize about five years ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was making a surprising comeback as a result of the AIDS epidemic.This year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United States is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases.An individual does not have to have a damaged immune system to contract an active case of tuberculosis.But when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as it can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect numerous others.It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis.There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the U.N. agency.
