About 70 per cent of Venetia's diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at Dollars 100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about Dollars 500m.Venetia was the first new South African diamond mine for 25 years.Only weeks before the mine came into production in July 1992 at a cost of USDollars 400m, De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from Angola.Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia, De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe.This year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so that the CSO is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to take from producers.
