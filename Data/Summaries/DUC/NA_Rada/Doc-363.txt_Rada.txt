A group known as "People for the American Way" papered Washington with ads headlining the case of "Robert Bork vs. The People," suggesting, apparently, that anyone who supports Judge Bork opposes "the people," not to mention the American way.The same ads implied that Judge Bork had no objection to "sterilizing workers," didn't believe in any right to privacy, and just might "Turn the clock back on civil rights?"Judge Bork isn't Justice Holmes, though he is probably one of the half-dozen best qualified Supreme Court nominees since Holmes.Judge Bork explained -- as he has dozens of times before -- his moral dilemma in seeking as solicitor general to follow the orders of a president, yet also keep the special prosecutor team from disbanding.Judge Bork had to explain that, yes, there are all kinds of privacy rights in the Constitution (the First, 4th and 5th amendments, for example), but he didn't believe there is any "generalized, undefined" right.If Judge Bork is not confirmed, however, the record of this week suggests that the reason will result less from his own failings than from the ferocity and distortions of his opponents.Judge Bork explained that he was concerned at the time about government coercion in private decisions, but that he had retracted that position more than a decade ago.The questioning, however, left little doubt about its goal -- to suggest that Judge Bork cares not at all for the rights of women, of minorities, of the press, or of pretty much anyone else.The idea is to raise such a public furor about the nominee's "extremism" that the fanatic moderates who often hold the balance of power in the Senate won't dare risk guilt by association by voting in favor.He is surely the most prolific, as well, and so the capital's standing army of activists and senators has this week been busily replaying everything he ever wrote or said, all in an attempt to prove he is a judicial extremist, a threat to the republic.That is when Judge Bork was explaining to Sen.
