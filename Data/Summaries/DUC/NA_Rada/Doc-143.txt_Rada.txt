Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on whether it might follow Bank of Boston's action.On the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as Bank of Boston decided Monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible.Along with $330 million in such loans previously put on non-accrual, Bank of Boston has now either charged off, or put on non-accrual, all of its $1 billion loans to heavily indebted developing countries.For instance, if Manufacturers Hanover Corp. imitated Bank of Boston's action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, Keefe Bruyette estimates.Bank of Boston also placed on non-accrual $470 million in loans to less-developed countries that are unrelated to trade.Now that Bank of Boston has reserved and written off most of its loans to less-developed countries, it's likely to be much less willing to join any such new efforts.Bank of Boston announced Monday that it was writing off $200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the Third World on a non-accrual basis.Earlier this year, Bank of Boston proved one of the more difficult regionals to corral into a $6 billion bank loan for Mexico, according to New York bankers.The reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like Bank of Boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities, bank analysts said.Analysts expect that other regional banks may copy the action taken by Bank of Boston.Continental wouldn't comment yesterday on Bank of Boston's action.
