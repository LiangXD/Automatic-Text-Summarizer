A lie detector that measures brain waves would be more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says its developer."When they see terms like that, their brain waves break into P3 waves."However, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would need a great deal more training, Weinstein said.
