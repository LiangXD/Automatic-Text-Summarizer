JEZERSKO, Yugoslavia -- On Wednesday, the Slovene soldiers manning this border post raised a new flag to mark Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia.Less than two days after Slovenia and Croatia, two of Yugoslavia's six republics, unilaterally seceded from the nation, the federal government in Belgrade mobilized troops to regain control.Yesterday, under artillery fire from the federal army, they waved a white flag and surrendered as Yugoslavia lurched closer to civil war.He called on Slovenes in the federal army to desert and join the republic's militia.Throughout the morning, federal soldiers, some bearing bazookas, fanned out in the woods surrounding the Slovenia customs house.Together, Slovenia, with two million people, and Croatia, with five million, supply nearly two-thirds of Yugoslavia's foreign exchange and about half of the country's gross national product.And on Tuesday night, after the two republics declared their independence, the federal parliament called on the army to intervene.The nationalist governments of Slovenia and Croatia have been demanding a looser confederation of sovereign republics.The first shooting between the federal army and the militias occurred here, in the mountains that mark the border with Austria.But the poorly trained and equipped Slovene and Croatian militias, formed in the past several months, are no match for the 180,000-strong federal army.The independence declarations came after months of unsuccessful negotiations among the leaders of the six republics over the post-Cold War shape of Yugoslavia.And they fear losing the economic support of Slovenia and Croatia, the two wealthiest republics.
