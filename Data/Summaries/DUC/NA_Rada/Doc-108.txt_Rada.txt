Shrubs and grasses cover what is left of the burnt undergrowth, although fire scars will be visible on some trees for years.Three to five additional bird species are likely to migrate into Yellowstone next year, attracted to the new plants and insects thriving in the meadows.Next year, the ground cover replacing the park's burnt stands of aging lodgepole pines should provide a 30-fold increase in plant species.The National Park Service has already been at the center of a much-publicized political firestorm over its 16-year-old "natural burn" policy, which allows lightning-caused fires to burn themselves out, except where they threaten towns or park buildings.Aspen trees, whose paper-white bark and yellow leaves punctuate the evergreen forests this time of year, also thrive after a fire.Wyoming's U.S. senators, Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Alan K. Simpson, are mindful of the damage the fires caused the state's tourist industry this year, as well as the threat to gateway towns near the park.For the first five years after a fire, while surrounding vegetation is still relatively low, there will be a proliferation of wildflowers in the park, she says.As Yellowstone National Park's research biologist, he has already begun to monitor the forest's rebirth from the worst fire on record.In an average year, 2.5 million tourists visit the huge park, and a drop-off because of the fire damage could severely hurt business.Yellowstone's elk and bison herds, as well as moose, should benefit from the additional forage in the park next year.Then the forest thins as it ages, trees fall, underbrush grows, and the forest is primed for a fire to start its life cycle over again.Hundreds of plant species proliferate after a fire until "canopy closure" is achieved in about 40 years.But next spring many of the seeds, fertilized by nutrients leaching into the soil from the snow-packed ash, will sprout, along with a bouquet of grasses, flowers and shrubs, as burnt areas of the park erupt with life.The burnt "snags," as charred tree trunks are called, creak in the wind above Mr. Despain and are all that remain of a forest section that sprouted after a fire swept through here about the time of the Civil War."Fires have been an integral force in the Yellowstone ecosystem for the past 10,000 years since the glaciers left," Mr. Varley says.The last fire to rival this year's in intensity roared across much of Yellowstone in the early 1700s.Driving along the 140 miles of the park's upper and lower scenic loop -- on roads open to park visitors -- one sees a Yellowstone that is a patchwork of green, brown and blackened forest and meadow.Grasses and several types of wildflowers, ranging from fireweed to wild geraniums, are already sprouting less than seven weeks after fire roared past Grant Village near Yellowstone Lake.Forests visited only by ground fires will rebound almost as quickly."Ecologically, there's no down side to the fire," he adds, conceding that similar statements by park officials may have sounded cavalier when the fires were raging.The profusion of pine seeds is just one of the rejuvenating forces at work in Yellowstone even as the fires, largely quenched this week by rain and snow, still smolder.Tourists will be back next year for this . . . and perhaps to see how nature is restoring the forest.Insects begin attacking the snags almost immediately after a fire, and the charred trunks are likely to be toppled by the wind.Yellowstone's meadows rebound the fastest after a fire.These and the rest of the park's thermal features remain unscathed by the fires.Carol Shively, a park ranger-naturalist at Grant Village in Yellowstone, says, "Next spring is going to be a spectacular one for wildflowers."But many snags, weathering to fence-post gray, will remain as monuments to the fire of 1988 for years to come.In recent years, environmentalists have for the most part succeeded in promoting the natural processes of the parks.The tiny seeds are slowly released from rock-hard pine cones only after the cones have been seared by the passing flames; indeed, they require a fire to propagate themselves.Seeds that have been dormant for decades beneath the soil appear to be triggered by the passing fire, he says, and will germinate next spring.
