Plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands in Biosphere II.In these areas, where well-defined habitats change, scientists hope to learn how desert encroaches on more productive areas, what happens when fresh water turns brackish, what goes on when climates change.Now suddenly they had to devise ways to keep the wild world in.The oxygen is breathed in by humans and animals who breathe out carbon dioxide which is breathed in by the plants and used in photosynthesis which produces more oxygen.Even the scientists came to cross-purposes in designing this little world.In all, some 3,800 species of plant and animal life are being invited to the party, and as in the original Eden, snakes.It then flows through the plains and grasslands of the savanna, down to the 25-foot deep ocean with its coral reef and then to the salt and freshwater marshes, drying up before it reaches the desert.Consider hummingbirds, great little pollinators.It is the professional nature of engineers and architects to keep the outside world out.The rain forest and its towering mountain and stream are the design of Dr. Ghillean Prance, director of the Kew Royal Botanical Gardens of London in association with the New York Botanical Garden."We've got acid rain problems, dirty air problems, and we've got carbon dioxide increasing at an alarming rate.
