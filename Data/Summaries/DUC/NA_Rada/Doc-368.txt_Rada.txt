Sitting in his office at the American Enterprise Institute, his back to his word processor, he briefly considers what might have been: "I don't want to spend the rest of my life reliving it.Bork, who abhored grading papers when he taught, says with a self-satisfied grin, "It's a very good faculty, with no blue books."Bork has plans for perhaps two more books, one in more academic detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools, and another on the relationship of law and the culture.The first time around when I was nominated for the Court of Appeals, the Senate approved me unanimously, as did the committee."Bork enjoys the atmosphere at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank that has become his small university."I think this book has the chance to have more impact.To his surprise, "The Tempting of America, The Political Seduction Of The Law," has been on the best-seller list for more than 10 weeks, and there are more than 190,000 copies in print.He recalls the impact of a book he wrote a dozen years ago on antitrust law."Not mine," says Bork.He says he is taking his case to a higher court, the American public and the next generation.
