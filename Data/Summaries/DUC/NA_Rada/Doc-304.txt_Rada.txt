WASHINGTON -- By choosing Clarence Thomas, a conservative black federal judge, for the Supreme Court, President Bush may have defused a fierce political battle over the high court's shift to the right.Judge Thomas, who has been sitting on the federal appeals court in Washington for just 14 months, won't be confirmed without a fight in the Senate focusing on his inexperience on the bench and his strong opposition to affirmative action.Judge Thomas, who just turned 43 last week, would be the youngest Supreme Court justice of the past 100 years with the exception of William O. Douglas, who joined the court when he was 40.Judge Thomas is well-liked by colleagues, both at the EEOC, where the new headquarters building is named for him, and at the appeals court.While liberals will focus on Judge Thomas's legal inexperience, his record on the bench doesn't present them with the sort of target they had with the articulated, sharply conservative legal views of Robert Bork, whose Supreme Court nomination was defeated in 1987.As a child, Judge Thomas said, "I could not dare dream that I would ever see the Supreme Court, not to mention be nominated to it.A number of Senate Democrats, including Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden of Delaware, stressed when Judge Thomas was confirmed for the appeals court that he would face tougher scrutiny if he were nominated for the Supreme Court.As other Supreme Court nominees have done, however, Judge Thomas is likely to go to great lengths to avoid committing himself on abortion, an issue that is expected to come before the court again and again.In light of the administration's strong attack on racial quotas in hiring, President Bush's selection of a black man to fill Justice Marshall's seat brought questions about whether he was in fact observing a quota on the court.Abortion-rights groups are also likely to be concerned about the fact that Judge Thomas is a Catholic who spent a year in a Missouri seminary in the 1960s pondering the priesthood.Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said, "With so many constitutional rights and personal liberties at stake, the Senate must make sure Clarence Thomas has demonstrated a commitment to equal opportunity and equal justice under the law. . . .If they go smoothly, Justice Thomas could be sworn in before the new Supreme Court term begins on Oct.He then served for a year as chief of the U.S. Education Department's civil rights office before President Reagan appointed him chairman of the EEOC in 1982.Though Judge Thomas may not find favor with those groups, the fact is that he knew nothing but segregation as he grew up outside Savannah, Ga., in the 1950s.
