WHEN Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's newly-appointed governor, arrives in the colony in July he will find that, five years away from its reversion to Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong is thriving.Although the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future which Britain and China signed in September 1984 and the Basic Law which the Chinese parliament passed in April 1991 provide for the maintenance of Hong Kong's way of life and a 'high degree of autonomy', the colony's citizens have continued to vote with their feet, seeking the protection of foreign lands and the passports they offer.Yet Mr Patten's main task is to preside over the peaceful transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997.Yet, in spite of the extraordinary economic integration that has taken place over the past decade, China, at a political level, divides Hong Kong society and politics.Today, Hong Kong's factory owners in Guangdong - the Chinese province bordering the colony - employ between 2m and 3m workers; Hong Kong supplies China with an estimated 40 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings by virtue of Chinese goods flowing through the colony, earnings of mainland companies in the colony and remittances by local people to families still in China; and, Hong Kong is the source of 60 per cent of foreign investment in China.Just a year ago the colony was in the doldrums: a bitter fight with China over colonial government's plans to build a huge airport was under way; the Gulf War had depressed tourist arrivals; and the colony's first partially democratic elections were looming.Last year, Hong Kong exported goods with a value of HKDollars 765.8bn; of these HKDollars 534.8 were 're-exports', more than 80 per cent of which related to trade with China.He will also have to deal with Mr Lu Ping, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, and China's most senior official in charge of day-to-day Hong Kong Affairs.But for the re-export trade, Hong Kong would have a visible trade deficit with the rest of the world because it is becoming more of a service area and transferring some of its manufacturing to south China.This change in Hong Kong's economy could not have happened without the historic change of course China embarked upon in 1979.
