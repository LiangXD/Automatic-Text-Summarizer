Rather, if he choose a political career as a Democrat, Powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's Henry "Scoop" Jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions on defending U.S. interests abroad.; The bottom line is that Powell presents intriguing opportunities for both parties.Nominating Powell to a future national ticket offers Republicans the chance to cement their presidential majority by breaking the Democratic hold on black votes.; For Democrats, conversely, a national slot for Powell could allow the party to simultaneously affirm its commitment to equal opportunity and dispatch persistent doubts about whether it is tough enough to protect American interests in an unstable world.; If Powell hints even the slightest interest, and Democrats are uncharacteristically alert, it could set off the kind of bipartisan bidding war not seen since 1948, when activists in both parties tried to draft Eisenhower as their presidential candidate.But the silky steeliness displayed during the crisis by Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has revived discussion of moving Vice President Dan Quayle out to make room for the general on the 1992 Republican ticket.; Yet there is some evidence to suggest that if Powell ever decided to seek elected office, he might be at least as comfortable running as a Democrat.; No one, of course, can imagine Powell carrying the Democratic banner next year against President Bush, his commander-in-chief.
