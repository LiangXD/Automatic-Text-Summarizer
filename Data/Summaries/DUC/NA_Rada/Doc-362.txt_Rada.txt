Lloyd Cutler, counsel to President Carter, supports Judge Bork as a jurist who "believes that judges should interpret the Constitution and the laws according to neutral principles, without reference to their personal views as to desirable social or legislative policy."The campaign against Judge Bork is shrill, mean and anti-intellectualan assault on the notion of law itself.Judge Robert Bork is the most qualified American alive to serve on the Supreme Court.Not one of the 416 opinions he has written or joined has been overturned by the Supreme Court.Any likely alternative, such as Orrin Hatch, would be a much more activist judge, though a far less distinguished one.One case where Judge Bork ruled for a labor union against a federal agency was classified by critics as "pro-business" because unions are "in the business" of representing workers.Legal resumes get no better than Judge Bork's.Law is just politics, judges just politicians in robes.Many federal judges look to his 1984 lecture on "Tradition and Morality in Constitutional Law" as a guide to approaching constitutional issues.Judge Bork is the leading proponent of judicial restraint.He practiced law in Chicago.
