Michael Milken, who faces insider trading charges, is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made "junk-bond" financing into the tool of choice for corporate raiders.In the years before the insider trading scandal, the financial media wrote glowingly of Milken.The 184-page civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York against Milken, Drexel and others on Wednesday followed months of speculation about Drexel's involvement in the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.It had been a relatively short road for Milken, from head cheerleader at Birmingham High School in the San Fernando Valley in 1964 _ actress Sally Field and superagent Michael Ovitz were among his classmates _ to the top of the nation's financial industry.He lives with his children and wife, Lori _ his high school sweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the former estate of the late actor Clark Gable in suburban Encino, an upper-middle-class section of the San Fernando Valley two miles from his childhood home.It was business as usual at Drexel, and Milken was still king of the junk bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate takeovers.Drexel merged with Burnham &amp; Co. in 1973 and Lambert Brussels Witter in 1976 to become today's Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Milken's job was moved to New York.
