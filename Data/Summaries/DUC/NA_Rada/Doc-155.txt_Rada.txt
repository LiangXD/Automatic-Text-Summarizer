Hamilton promoter Gaines has heard it before, and makes no apology for paying Johnson more than other athletes.BIG MONEY Promoters of indoor meets this season doubt that Johnson will regain his records, but they hope that fans will turn out in huge numbers to watch him try."I've had that thought myself, paying him that much money," he said.The IAAF voted last September to adopt the controversial "Ben Johnson Rule" allowing the IAAF Council to decertify an athlete's records, titles and results if he or she later is shown to have used a banned substance before those performances.He still is awaiting word from the Canadian Olympic Assn., which placed a lifetime ban on Johnson that prohibited him from representing Canada in the Olympic Games.If the public will pay to watch Johnson is another question.Indeed, in a season that holds the promise of high performance levels in general (as athletes peak for the world indoor championships in Seville, Spain, in March), Johnson's return to competition might help rejuvenate a sport in need of public interest.That may go a long way to easing Johnson back into a sport that disowned him almost as swiftly as he burst on the scene.Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York has an interest in Johnson, but perhaps not the budget.Futerman limits Johnson's contact with the media, saying "Ben has said all he has to say.Similarly, Johnson was erased from track and field's record books."I'd like to have Ben Johnson regardless of how he runs.The rule stripped Johnson of his world record of 9.83 in the 100 meters and 6.41 in the indoor 60 meters.Some meet directors report concern that longtime sponsors will be reluctant to be associated with a meet that has Johnson as its marquee athlete, given Johnson's former association with anabolic steroids."If he's eligible to compete, to me, Ben Johnson is an attraction," said Ray Lumpp, meet director for the indoor meet at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J..Ben sort of transcends the sport, and, God knows, we need someone to transcend the sport."I can't say that it's wrong, especially when deep down I know Johnson's not the only one who's ever taken drugs."Right now, I can't think of anybody who would arouse as much interest as Ben Johnson."Will he be the same Johnson?"I want to take back the titles and the records I have been deprived of," the Associated Press quoted Johnson as saying.Many of those around Johnson have changed, too."There has been damage to the sport and people want to blame Ben personally for that damage," Gaines said."There is a lot of interest in seeing whether this fellow is a truly great runner or if he is what Carl Lewis said he is, a fair runner who got there by taking drugs," Schmertz said.If you give him $10,000 and people are beating him, you could have problems."It would be ironic if Johnson becomes the star who revitalizes indoor track and field after being blamed for the steady decline of sponsor interest in outdoor track.Johnson gave an in-depth interview to the German magazine, Sport, but only after being paid.One thing that may not happen is a much-discussed lucrative match race between Johnson and Lewis.Even though Johnson admitted to having taken drugs since 1981, the rule carries a six-year statue of limitations.How much ground will Johnson lose as a drug-free sprinter?It was a scene that recalled the golden days for Ben Johnson.It has been two years since Johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics.The question remains, is Ben Johnson capable of running at that brilliant level again?
