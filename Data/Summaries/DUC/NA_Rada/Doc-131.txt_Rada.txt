In an emotional news conference afterward, Samuelson, who won the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984 at Los Angeles, tearfully conceded that she might have run her last marathon for some time.Joan Benoit Samuelson, who set a world record on this course in 1983, was beset with physical problems that altered her stride at 11 miles, and she finished ninth among the women in 2:37:52.Samuelson, who holds the U.S. marathon record, said she will significantly decrease her training mileage and probably run shorter races.It had been at least eight years since Samuelson was beaten in the marathon by an American.It also was the first time Kristiansen had beaten Samuelson in a marathon.John Treacy of Ireland, who was third behind Ikangaa here last year, was third again in 2:10:24.Kristiansen, the women's marathon world record-holder, started fast but slowed markedly on a hot day.And they ran not as strangers, because Mekonnen had beaten Ikangaa in winning last year's Tokyo Marathon.Or at least since the last time Ethiopia ventured from its athletic isolation and won three consecutive Olympic gold medals, putting its indelible stamp on the marathon.THEY'VE GOT A LOCK ON THE MARATHON How Ethiopia's marathoners have fared the last two days:Samuelson held on to second place and even ran comfortably until about 11 miles, when she came undone."I was prepared for hot weather and it certainly was hot, but the heat wasn't my problem today," Samuelson said."I knew that I should stay with him until the last (two miles).For the first few miles, before the heat, Kristiansen was running at a 2:17 pace.It was the first time since 1963 that an Ethiopian had run at Boston and Mekonnen, 24, made the most of it.Mekonnen, a police lieutenant from Addis Ababa, made a furious rush with a mile to go, passing Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania and winning Monday's Boston Marathon in 2 hours 9 minutes 6 seconds.Ethiopia also took the marathon gold in 1968, when Mamo Wolde, 36, won at altitude in Mexico City.Also on Sunday, in the World Cup Marathon at Milan, Ethiopians finished 1-2."Before I came to Boston, I had a lot of problems with my hip and my back.In two days, Ethiopian runners have won three major marathons.The pace got the best of Saimon Robert Haali of Tanzania, who led the race for five miles.Nearly a dozen Ethiopian runners have been deployed around the world in this hectic two-week period of spring marathons.He was among the pack of four African runners that led the 6,418 entrants race for 15 miles."I've run some very good races and I think I have some very good races left in me," she said.But the story of Monday's 93rd Boston race was Mekonnen and his nation of 42 million, which has reemerged as a force to be reckoned with in marathon running.Lisa Weidenbach went flying by me at that point.
