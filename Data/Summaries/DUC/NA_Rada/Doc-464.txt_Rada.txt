Mr Zhou Nan, the most senior representative of the Chinese Communist party and government in Hong Kong, recently attacked Mr Patten's plans for a government-funded pension, saying: 'During the transition period, we should not casually transplant a costly Euro-socialist pay-as-you-go concept to Hong Kong without prudently taking into consideration similar western programmes' long-standing track record of grossly under-estimating liabilities and grossly over-estimating funding projections.''Mr Patten is the governor and the representative of the Hong Kong British government,' says one senior Chinese official in Hong Kong.Mr Tsang, a member of the Chinese government committee planning for the handover, says the provisional legislature will have full powers to make laws for an expected term of nine to 12 months.This decision is set to take Hong Kong into uncharted waters, and casts doubt over the continuity of the colony's legal system.After the dispute on electoral reform, Beijing announced that it would dismiss the 1995 LegCo once China resumed sovereignty of Hong Kong, and replace it with a provisional legislature.The through train encapsulated the hope that those elected in 1995 to the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's 60-member law making body, would be able to serve their full four-year term, regardless of the 1997 handover.Mr Patten claims that by 1997 public spending in Hong Kong as a percentage of GDP will be lower than it was in 1982 - the year Britain began handover negotiations with China.And Chinese officials in Hong Kong indicate a desire to deal with the nitty-gritty of the transfer at a meeting of the Joint Liaison Group, a bilateral body with Britain, this month.'We are not suggesting any change to the curriculum,' says Mr Tsang Yok Sing, a leading Beijing adviser in Hong Kong who is himself a school headmaster.'At least one senior Chinese official has said to me he believes there is no change of restoring co-operation and trust unless and until we have a new governor,' says Mr Tsang.'We sent a selection of textbooks to Beijing and they were shocked . . . by references to Taiwan as the Republic of China, the People's Republic as a neighbour, and the glossing over of Britain's role in the Opium War.'However, the Basic Law - the China-drafted mini-constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong - does not provide for a provisional legislature as such, although it does foresee a 'preparatory committee' to be formed in 1996 that will determine who sits in this legislature.China's supporters in the colony claim that Mr Patten's policy is now to make Hong Kong harder to govern by 'loosening the screws' before the British leave.One Chinese banker says: 'Hong Kong will become less free; more like Singapore.Mr Patten is adamant that he is not leaving Hong Kong until he has discharged his duty.
