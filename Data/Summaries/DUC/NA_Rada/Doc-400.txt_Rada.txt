Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year, reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for their comrades jailed in Kuwait.Islamic Jihad issued its statement as the leader of Iran's revolutionary radicals, former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, was on a three-week visit to Lebanon.Anderson and Sutherland are among eight American hostages, most believed held by pro-Iranians.Prominent journalists, along with representatives of the State Department and the embassies of Lebanon, Algeria and Syria, attended a Mass in Georgetown University's Dahlgren Chapel, where Mrs. Say said such ceremonies ensure her brother will not be forgotten.Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the whereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon.The statement was seen as a response to a declaration Monday by President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran that he would use its influence to free the hostages if the United States released Iranian assets worth up to $12 billion that have been frozen since 1979.Terry Anderson spent a fifth birthday as a hostage today, a grim milestone in his captivity.
