Through the years Mr. Gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing, in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime.Similarly, Mr. Gates vehemently opposed the Police Corps Program backed by other police chiefs.Many chiefs openly disagreed with Mr. Gates when he opposed the Police Corps Bill in Congress.Two years ago, on a national television documentary, Mr. Gates defended a special unit that had shot many criminals during stakeouts.It is hard to see how the Los Angeles Police Department can regain credibility unless Daryl Gates's leave becomes permanent.Public opinion polls in Los Angeles show the majority of people believe police brutality is common, and they disapprove of the way Mr. Gates has done his job.Mr. Gates opposed the Police Corps because its members would not be professionals.But the videotape of the LAPD brutality affects the credibility of all police officers.The presence of even one police corps officer witness would have deterred the criminal cops.
