Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support.And the demands put on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private provision of pensions and healthcare.Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these.An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in borrowing to fund the welfare state.The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions.Continuing rises in the base level of unemployment would further undermine countries' ability to pay for their welfare states.Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes.In a global economy, no country can long afford to burden business with higher welfare costs than its neighbours.Increases in life expectancy have already increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions.The strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by relating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age.Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.The OECD's immediate priorities for reform include charges for the use of some welfare services and greater competition to increase the efficiency of those services.Moves are afoot in countries such as Germany and Italy to raise the pension age.In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.Tackling these longer-term pressures will require more than tinkering with charges and efficiency drives in welfare services.Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.Added to concerns over demography and social change are fears over the increase in unemployment levels across the OECD.Although there are considerable differences between national health systems, healthcare reforms in countries such as the UK and the Netherlands are increasingly converging on models that use competition and price incentives to control costs.
