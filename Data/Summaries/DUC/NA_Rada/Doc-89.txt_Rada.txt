"There's going to be a price of living together in a communal society."; YOU'RE INTERESTEDEmployees who think that poor air quality at their workplace is contributing to health problems can call Cal-OSHA, a state agency that monitors worker safety and health.Respiratory infection experts say that flu viruses and measles are easier to spread than TB.; "This particular study deals only with TB," says Dr. Jonathan Samet, a respiratory-disease expert at the University of New Mexico, "but the observations may apply to other organisms, such as the respiratory viruses that cause flu."; Building workers had complained for years about poor air quality.; The building's ventilation system permitted circulation of some outdoor air -- 15 cubic feet per minute -- a low level commonly found in buildings since the 1930s.Even lower levels of outdoor air ventilation, below 10 cfm, have become common since 1973, the post-oil embargo era.; In the study, Nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that Massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis.; Other studies have documented:; (check) Flu spreads quickly on airplanes where ventilation systems consist entirely of recirculated air.; (check) Measles are transmitted by infectious air in a pediatrician's waiting room.; (check) Tuberculosis can spread in homeless shelters, prisons and hospitals where ventilation is poor.; Flu spreads much more easily than TB."In those tight buildings, they continue to recirculate it, and they probably build up."; Nardell and others recognize that the solution to this problem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air -- can be expensive.
