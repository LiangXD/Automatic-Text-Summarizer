Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.6m) a year monitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research.In Japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the Tokai area was overdue for a significant quake.Kiyoo Mogi, chairman of the six-member panel that will make the call on the Tokai earthquake and former head of the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute, says several factors make the Tokai region more suited than others for what he calls 'a national experiment'.Japan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists throughout the world were optimistic about prediction.Japan's prediction research activities, primarily overseen by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, are subject to no such review.Japan has had numerous killer quakes outside the Tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off the coast of Hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives.The public, and even public officials, remain largely unaware that Japan's scientists are debating whether prediction is impossible or merely difficult.If the committee so advises, Japan's prime minister will issue an earthquake warning for the Tokai area.Despite the protests, however, Japan's earthquake prediction programme rolls along on inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations.The evidence is that significant strain has accumulated along the fault since the region's last big earthquake.
