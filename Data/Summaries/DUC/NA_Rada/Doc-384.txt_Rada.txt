After years of debate, court rulings and federal legislation, use of the polygraph has dropped sharply, despite supporters who insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a lie.Reading from a Defense Department statement regarding the use of polygraphs, Turner said: "In all instances the polygraph exam process produced data of important security or criminal significance which was not otherwise obtainable.New Mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a polygraph examination as evidence, with the trial judge deciding whether the tests meet certain standards."I think it's appropriate to seek if someone is lying, and the most appropriate way is to seek evidence," said Judy Crockett, who fought on behalf of the federal law for the American Civil Liberties Union.A prosecutor calls it "witchcraft" and a psychologist says it's as reliable as a coin toss.Many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if both the prosecution and defense agree.The court, noting polygraph studies have shown success rates varying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent, said: "There remains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraph testing to detect deceit."
