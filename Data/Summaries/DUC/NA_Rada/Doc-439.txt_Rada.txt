This year's cereal production among smallholders is estimated to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest, and only 28 per cent higher than in 1991/92, when drought devasted southern Africa.Despite a bumper harvest last year, Malawi has not recovered from the massive 1991/92 drought.Although landlocked, Malawi proved in the 1991/92 drought it was adequately equipped to handle the transportation, storage and internal distribution of large volumes of food imported through South Africa, Mozambican or, possibly, Tanzanian ports [words indistinct].
