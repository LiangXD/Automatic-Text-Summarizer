I think we're approaching that breaking point," said Van Hayden, 25, a student who says police beat him at the hotel.In a series of rallies in recent weeks, protesters demanded that officers involved in the drug raid be suspended, charges against those arrested at the hotel be dropped, and that a citizen police review board be established.The city's police chief, John Laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society."The matter of police misconduct and brutality has been going on for at least the 21 years I've been here, but I think the deaths pushed the issue beyond the point of tolerance that usually is the case in matters of police misconduct," Glover said."There are bad apples in every bunch and the Minneapolis Police Department is no exception," said Councilwoman Sayles Belton.Allegations of police misconduct currently are reviewed by a panel appointed by the mayor.Gleason Glover, president of the Minneapolis Urban League, which works for interracial cooperation, said police racism has been a problem since he took over the league position 21 years ago.
