But following an embargo by Serbia on Slovene imports in 1990, and ensuing war in neighbouring Croatia last year, Slovene exports to the former Yugoslavia have fallen to 15 per cent of that previously.Until 1990, over 30 per cent of Slovenia's exports were with the former Yugoslavia, while about 70 per cent were divided between Comecon, the now defunct socialist trading block, and western European countries.Mrs Vojka Ravbar, Slovenia's deputy foreign minister, who earlier this week headed a trade delegation to the UK, said enterprises will have to become even more competitive after privatisation.
