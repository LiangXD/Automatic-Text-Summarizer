That is why the American Diabetes Assn. and other health education groups in the Los Angeles area and California have begun a major push to educate Latinos about diabetes.The number of Latino diabetics in the United States will nearly quadruple by the year 2000 to 8 million, according to projections by Eli Lilly Co. Caring for them will cost more than $10 billion a year, even if the disease has no complications, the company projects.Davidson said he is confident that Latinos will respond to education efforts on diabetes."Many people think that when Latinos come here (to the United States) they gain weight because they continue to eat the way they ate at home.For instance, the fact that Type II diabetes frequently shows up in women during or shortly after pregnancy gives health educators an ideal chance to influence an entire Latino family's eating habits, said Dr. Martin Montoro, co-director of the diabetes and pregnancy service at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.If you have already a predisposed group of people, such as the Latinos, you get more obesity and you get more diabetes."Any Latino woman whose child was born at 9 pounds or larger should consider herself at risk of diabetes and alter her diet, Davidson said."We need to get into the communities and start teaching the kids and the adolescents and the parents to make some changes in their habits," said Dr. Jaime Davidson, a Dallas physician who has spearheaded the diabetes association's Latino education efforts.Latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are Anglos, and incidence of the disease increases with age.In addition, Latino diets can be rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote obesity and increase the chance of getting diabetes.Chief among these is that the Latino patient is less likely to volunteer information or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the Anglo patient, said Dr. Aliza Lifshitz, a board member of the California Hispanic American Medical Assn.Other barriers to Latinos getting care for diabetes are more subtle, doctors interested in the issue say.Nationwide, it is estimated that there are more than 2 million Latinos who already have diabetes, many of them undiagnosed.In one survey done in San Antonio, a third of the Latinos between the ages of 55 and 65 had diabetes, Davidson said.The effort is being aided by interested physicians and by drug companies, which make insulin and other drugs used for diabetes that can't be controlled by changes in eating habits."In some states like California or Texas, if nothing is done we're going to pay so much money for health care for people of Latino origin that it may become prohibitive."Genetically controlled defects in the body's insulin system are also thought to exist both for them and Latinos.Like heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among Latinos is a condition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors say.
