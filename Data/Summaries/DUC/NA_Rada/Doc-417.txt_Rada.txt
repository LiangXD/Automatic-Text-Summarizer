The construction boom was created, experts say, by an aggressive marketing strategy used in the past few years by the state, the city's Convention Authority and the major hotels to capture conventions, trade shows and group tours.New Experiences Planned But Las Vegas is banking on more than its current gaming and convention capabilities to draw visitors and fill hotel rooms.In the eight years I've been here, not that many new motels have been built because most convention and trade show people want hotels with all their amenities."But Fletch Brunelle, research coordinator for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said that there are hotel construction projects under way all over the city."The Mirage and Excalibur will be the first new major projects in the city in 15 years, and with their unusual features, they will be must-sees."Las Vegas is also betting on what state tourism director Moreno describes as "new experiences," like the live dolphins that will perform at the Mirage and jousting tournaments that will be held at Excalibur."Las Vegas turned from a weekend regional, getaway place where people would drive to go, to a national convention place competitive with such cities as San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles," said Robinson of KPMG Peat Marwick."And when you consider that only about 10% of the people in the United States have ever been to Las Vegas, you know that the city has a hell of a long way to grow."Many of the new rooms are being added to existing hotels, which are also expanding their casinos and convention halls, Leonard added.The proximity of Southern California to Las Vegas undoubtedly contributes to the fact that the growth in Nevada, in terms of casino revenues and visitors, is "overwhelmingly in Clark County," said Andy Grose, executive director of the state's Economic Development Commission.Pull from the Midwest "And I'd say that Las Vegas still enjoys a tremendous pull from the Midwestern states and even from Buffalo and areas approximate to Atlantic City, which is still trying to get better airport and convention facilities to emulate Las Vegas."Although the first of a three-phased, $1-billion expansion of McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas was completed a few years ago, the second phase is under way, and the city has just launched a $35-million expansion of its convention center.Laughlin, also in Clark County but a little closer than Las Vegas to Los Angeles, had 430 hotel rooms in 1981 but slightly more than 4,000 at the end of 1988, he noted, and it is expected to have about 13,000 at the end of 1991.Many hotels are also adding convention accommodations, including the Sands, where a 1-million-square-foot convention center, touted as "the largest outside a facility operated by a community," is expected to be completed in 17 months.Tours from Europe The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority hopes to make the city a top destination for tours from Europe as well."Southern California is our primary market," Sain said, estimating that Californians represent up to 42% of all Las Vegas visitors, which jumped from 11.7 million to 17.2 million in the past 10 years.In the meantime, the race is on to see which hotel will have the most rooms to attract the largest conventions."Las Vegas is the third largest convention city in the United States and probably will be No.A 1,700-room, 42-story tower, which is being called "the tallest in the state," is expected to bring the Riviera Hotel's room count to about 4,000 in late 1991 or 1992."Las Vegas is experiencing the greatest growth phase of its history," said Saul F. Leonard, a gaming industries expert with Laventhol &amp; Horwath, Los Angeles."Nevada, especially Las Vegas, is already one of the top destinations for group tours coming from Asia," said Rich Moreno, state director of tourism.2 within the next two years," Leonard said.New sites are also coming up for future gaming, convention and hotel development.Las Vegas is also betting on a super-speed train, which would make the trip from downtown Las Vegas to downtown Los Angeles in an hour -- for $65, round trip.
