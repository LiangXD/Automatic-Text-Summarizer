Crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. Maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s.Zimbabwe's needs are put at about 2m tonnes of maize and 500,000 tonnes of wheat, sugar and other products, while Malawi will need at least 1m tonnes and Zambia more than 800,000 tonnes.At best, it will take the industry until 1994-95 to regain average production levels of the late 1980s, while the economy as a whole is unlikely to recover fully from the drought of 1992 for at least two years.Following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, exports of farm produce in US dollar terms will be sharply lower, with tobacco earnings of less than USDollars 500m, compared with Dollars 520m in 1991 (28 per cent of total exports).The country's textile and clothing industry - the main exporter of manufactured goods - has warned of production cutbacks and lay-offs unless it is allowed to import cotton this year.Cotton deliveries are forecast at less than 90,000 tonnes, down from 205,000 tonnes in 1991, soyabeans at 30,000 tonnes (133,000 tonnes last year), while winter wheat production is expected to fall to less than a third of normal levels.
