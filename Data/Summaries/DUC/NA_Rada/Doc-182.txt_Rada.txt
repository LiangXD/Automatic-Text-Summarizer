The Air Force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights for two more years, but has made it clear it plans to phase out the missions.Last season, 505 people died in Atlantic hurricanes, including Gilbert and Joan.During the average Atlantic hurricane season, which stretches from June through the end of November, six tropical storms will grow into hurricanes, with heavy rains and winds of 74 mph."I spoke to about 5,000 people on the west coast of Florida," Sheets said.And only one satellite is available for tracking hurricanes.There are new satellites on the horizon, says Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center.
