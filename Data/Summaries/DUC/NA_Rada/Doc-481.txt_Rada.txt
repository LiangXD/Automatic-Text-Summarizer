The sub-minimum, under the Bush plan, would be $3.35 an hour after the first increase in the minimum wage.President Bush today renewed his threat to veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond $4.25 an hour as Senate Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage floor to $4.55.Meanwhile, a new poll said there was overwhelming public support for an increase in the minimum wage, which has been at $3.35 since 1981.Bush has proposed three 30-cent increases in the minimum wage beginning Jan.While the House-passed bill cuts the final target of the hourly minimum wage to $4.55, it moves up the effective dates of the three increases from Jan.The president said his support for those increases hinges on a provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for six months regardless of any past experience with another employer.But Kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his measure identical to the House bill passed two weeks ago, which has a final wage of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants in the job market a "sub-minimum" for two months.
