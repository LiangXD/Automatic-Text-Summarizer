Thomas was to begin his testifying later in the afternoon.; Even before Biden rapped the opening gavel, Thomas' nomination triggered a confirmation battle more akin to a political campaign -- television commercials, endorsements by dozens of groups for and against, and a daily drumbeat of support from President Bush.; Abortion aside, Thomas also is expected to be questioned about his views on civil rights -- especially affirmative action -- and the right of privacy.; Thomas smiled broadly as he shook hands with Biden and other members of the committee in advance of the opening gavel.; Moment of humor; For the most part, he sat quietly at the witness table while members of the committee outlined their views on his nomination.; There was a moment of humor when Biden asked Thomas how old he was."I have no clear idea of your approach to the Constitution."; "I am also troubled by your open admiration for those who are willing to deceive and defy Congress and by the hostility you have demonstrated toward Congress both in action and in word," Leahy said.; As the hearings opened, the White House expressed confidence today that the Senate would confirm Thomas.; "It's just beginning up there; it's just beginning," Bush said when asked if Thomas' confirmation was assured.; "People know of my total support for him and I think he'll do very well.And I think to do less than that would be irresponsible on our part."; White House spokesman Judy Smith said today that, although the White House would not divulge numbers in an informal head count, "We're confident Judge Thomas will be confirmed."; If confirmed, Thomas would be the 106th Supreme Court justice but only the second black.; The committee is expected to closely examine Thomas' record as chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and as head of the Education Department's civil rights office.
