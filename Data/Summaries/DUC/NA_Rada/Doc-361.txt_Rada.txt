Two hundred years ago in Philadelphia, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention considered a proposal to join executive and judicial authority in a "council of revision" - a body that would have authority to reject and reshape laws enacted by the legislature.Commenting on Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, Geoffrey Stone, dean of the University of Chicago Law School, called it "a four-star appointment" and commented that it was rare "to get anyone with anywhere near his credentials."The Constitution, however, commands a neutral-principled approach to judicial decision making, and a Bork confirmation would help restore the balance among the three branches of government the framers so carefully crafted.Far from being ideologically partisan, as some have charged, Judge Bork holds fast to a neutral-principled approach irrespective of whose ox is being gored: "The sin of wanting judges to do good things simply because the electorate won't do them," he explained in the same interview, "is not confined to liberalism.Law making -- policy making -- by judges has become so pervasive that, of late, many see it as the judicial function against which potential judges must be measured.Later, in explaining the Constitution he helped to forge, Alexander Hamilton called the judiciary the "least dangerous" branch, despite the life tenure for federal judges, because it had neither "FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment" and because it could take "no active resolution whatever" in policy matters when that would require a choice among competing legitimate social values.Judge Bork's elevation to the Supreme Court may very well tip the balance toward this neutrality of interpretation, and there are those who fear that the court -- no longer able to do what the individual justices may think is "good" or "moral" or "right" -- will reject activist social, economic and criminal-justice agendas.They began, in the words of the late Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter -- a social liberal but a judicial conservative -- "infusing into the vagueness" of constitutional or statutory provisions their "mere private notions" of social policy and traded their black robes of "judgment" for the mantle of what sociologist David Reisman has called "omnicompetent arrogance."In many respects, the judiciary has become the "master" branch of government because we have permitted judges' personal views to supplant the rule of established law.
