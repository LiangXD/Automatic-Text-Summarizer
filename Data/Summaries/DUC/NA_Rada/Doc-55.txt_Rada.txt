The House Democrats' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious.They point out that part of the money will go for special education, training and work programs for welfare mothers, to induce them off the rolls and into jobs.By adding several welfare programs to what already exists (without eliminating any), the House bill adds another layer to an already complex welfare system.The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients.It is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the Family Welfare Reform Act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency.This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987.Of course, House Democrats could hardly promote this bill as more of the same.The bulk of the new money would go to higher AFDC pay-outs, extension of mandatory benefits to two-parent families and maintenance of certain benefits for welfare recipients earning some income.By further increasing rather than gradually reducing the level of benefits available to recipients, it makes welfare more, not less, enticing.
