One crew member gushed about a future when humans will become "custodians of our world."; "Today we gather at a new instrument . . . to explore the mysteries of our very own home planet," Bass said, as the crew members, wearing futuristic black uniforms, fought to contain their emotions.; Crew member Abigail Alling, 31, her voice quavering, evoked the sometimes mystical bent of Biosphere 2's organizers: "By necessity, we biospherians walk in as custodians of our world and bring past and future together."; At 8:18 a.m., the four men and four women of the crew exchanged quick hugs and kisses with relatives and project officials, stepped through an air-lock door, waved through the round window, and disappeared inside the 3.15-acre geodesic-framed compound.; "I have had a vision that man could change from being a desert-maker into a builder of oases," crew member Mark Nelson said before stepping through the air lock.; Biosphere 2 consists of several climatic zones -- rain forest, savanna, ocean and marsh -- packed with 3,800 plant and animal species.Another four hours a day will go to scientific work.; Sex has not been ruled out among the crew members, but none of the four women plans a pregnancy.; Mark van Thillo, 30, of Belgium said he would miss his country's chocolates, while Taber McCallum, 27, of Albuquerque, N.M., said he'll regret not "sailing on the open ocean and the open sky."; The crew is hoping to stay inside for two years, barring serious illness or other calamity.; But Margret Augustine, president and chief executive officer of the project, said problems could crop up after a month or so that would require the crew to leave temporarily before returning for a solid two years.
