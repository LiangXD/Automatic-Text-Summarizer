Eurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable without the high-speed rail link.But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits.As a result of Thursday's decision, the journey time to London from Paris will be about three hours -- 30 minutes longer than with a high-speed rail link.Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services."A high-speed link which covers {only} part of the route proves to be fairly uncompetitive with other transportation modes," says Bill Steinmetz, vice president of transport for consultants Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. in London."If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links.Defending the decision, Mrs. Thatcher earlier told Parliament that the government already had earmarked almost #2 billion for chunnel-related projects, including #600 million on roads leading to the tunnel and #1.3 billion in passenger and freight rail services.
