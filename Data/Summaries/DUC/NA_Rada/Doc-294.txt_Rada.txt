"This is just a normal day," said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center.Three were in the South Pacific, a 5.9-magnitude shaker near New Caledonia, and quakes of 5.1 and 5.0 in the area of Tonga.In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said."There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said Person, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than 25 years.Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said.A 7 reading is a "major" earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a "great" quake, capable of tremendous damage.An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
