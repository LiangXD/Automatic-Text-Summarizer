As polar literature, Mr. Steger's account, written with Jon Bowermaster, cannot equal the technical fascination of Amundsen's "The South Pole."The Trans-Antarctica Expedition Mr. Steger writes about in "Crossing Antarctica" (Knopf, 304 pages, $25) was born of the ambitions of Mr. Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne, who met in 1986 in the middle of separate arctic journeys.Mr. Steger is also a keen judge of dogs, who share equally in the credit for Trans-Antarctica."Dahe will do well," Mr. Steger decided, a judgment vindicated over 3,741 miles in windchills sometimes approaching minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit.Nor can it approach the tragic drama of Apsley Cherry-Garrard's "The Worst Journey in the World," which recounts the death of Scott's party after much agony only 11 miles from a cache of food and fuel.Mr. Steger was leading the first confirmed unsupported dog-sled expedition to the North Pole and Dr. Etienne was making the first solo ski there.Steger and Somers.
