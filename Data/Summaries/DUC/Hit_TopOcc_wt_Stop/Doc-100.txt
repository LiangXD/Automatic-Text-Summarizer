councilman john acosta said he was saddened by the senate's action because the city was determined to count every single person, and i know that (now) we're going to to suffer from this monetarily. pete wilson (r-calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx of immigration beyond the legal limits. westminster is following a recommendation by the census bureau to form a complete count committee of officials and community leaders to help ensure cooperation from all city residents. gloria mcdonough, director of abrazar center, an elderly-assistance center for latinos in westminster, said the senators' action shows they have no understanding of the impact of illegal immigration to california communities. in recent weeks, representatives from the census office in santa ana have visited such social centers as abrazar and others and told center staff people that they intend to count everyone, regardless of where they came from, mcdonough said. adrian dove, assistant regional director for the u.s. census in charge of outreach, said that despite the senate's decision, the census bureau really doesn't know how to go about finding who was legal or illegal. opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical because the census bureau has already printed questionnaires that do not contain any question about legality of residence.
