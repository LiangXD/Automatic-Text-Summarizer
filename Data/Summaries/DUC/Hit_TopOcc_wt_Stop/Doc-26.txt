as they scanned the flow of passengers at los angeles international airport, police detective clayton searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby. only later did searle and his partner from the drug enforcement administration realize that the suspected drug courier they had arrested on that march day in 1988 was joe morgan, the former cincinnati reds second baseman who was inducted monday into major league baseball's hall of fame. there's no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped joe morgan was because he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by, said william barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer. asked to identify himself, morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was in an attache case about 40 feet away but that searle refused to let him retrieve it. he was taken to a small children's nursery in the terminal and interrogated, but within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, morgan said. honey a. lewis, who represents the officer and the police department, said searle had acted properly and was merely asking morgan to identify himself when morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities and slapping the officer. although the officers found no drugs in his possession, searle said they discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began looking for his companion.
