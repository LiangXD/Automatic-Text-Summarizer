us cities along the gulf of mexico from alabama to eastern texas were on storm watch last night as hurricane andrew headed west after sweeping across southern florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. the hurricane was one of the fiercest in the us in decades and the first to hit miami directly in a quarter of a century. mr george lloyd-roberts, chairman of lloyd's underwriters' non-marine association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded pounds 3bn, the lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. however, hurricane andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the gulf of mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards new orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. a substantial part of america's oil refining industry is concentrated on the gulf coast, in louisiana and texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. andrew, the first caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. president bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state.
