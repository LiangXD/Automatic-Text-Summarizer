the eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of tuxpan, on mexico's west coast. the effect of it -- the view of seeing the sun disappear little by little and then actually having the (blue) sky disappear and having the birds stop singing -- it's miraculous, said irving hochman, a member of the san francisco amateur astronomers. bob bruynesteyn, head of the san mateo astronomical society, puts it succinctly: not too many people have stood in the shadow of the moon. but after enveloping the big island and then slicing across southern baja, the moon's shadow will cross the gulf of california and race across the southern flank of mexico and down the west coast of central america. another possibility is to search around for groups making the trip that have had late cancellations, as the dei rossis did. from the border to the northern edge of where the eclipse will be total is about a 16-hour drive, said raul cardenas, the mexican consul in san jose. if you're interested an eight-page brochure on the july 11 eclipse is available for $2 from the astronomical society of the pacific, 390 ashton ave., san francisco, ca 94112.
