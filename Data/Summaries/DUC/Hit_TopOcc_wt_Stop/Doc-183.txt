hurricane chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the texas and louisiana coasts monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside. rescue divers, however, were unable to search the overturned service vessel for survivors because of increasingly strong winds and high waves. the hope was that at least some of the crew would be in airtight cabins with enough oxygen to survive until help reached them. but coast guard petty officer bob morehead said the search was called off in the late afternoon because winds were in excess of 60 m.p.h. and waves were at 12 feet and building. shortly thereafter, the national hurricane center in miami announced that chantal was blowing at more than 74 m.p.h., strong enough to move it into the lowest hurricane classification, and the winds were later reported at 75 m.p.h. officials at the national hurricane service in miami said the storm was expected to reach land some time this afternoon or evening. bob ebaugh, a weather specialist at the hurricane center, said 10 to 15 inches of rain was expected in southern mississippi, louisiana and east texas.
