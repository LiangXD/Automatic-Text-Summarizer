12, 1986, at canterbury with the signing of the tunnel treaty by margaret thatcher and francois mitterrand (whose rolls-royce reportedly was met with flying eggs and chants of froggy, froggy, froggy, out, out, out ), promises to be completed and open for business by june 1993. we only hear of other machines, such as a giant pump in a 230-foot shaft that sucks the spoil slurry out of the tunnel, but we get some more big figures for the notebooks: two thousand tons of spoil come out every hour 500 tons of material go in money, the press here reports, is being spent at a rate of $4.4 million a day. the 1986 treaty, which contains a clause prohibiting government subsidies for the tunnel, gave a 55-year concession to eurotunnel, an anglo-french partnership that commissioned trans manche link, a consortium of five english contractors (costain, wimpey, taylor woodrow, balfour beatty and tarmac) and five french (boygues, dumez, societe generale d'entreprise, societe auxiliaire d'entreprises, spie batignolles) to design and build the tunnel. nineteen ninety-two may mean an end to duty-free goods, but the tunnel will be more than a symbol of european unity it will, transport analysts say, reinforce historically dominant trading links in the london-frankfurt-milan so-called golden triangle, bolstering northern europe as an economic entity at a time when its pre-eminence is being challenged by a strengthened mediterranean sunbelt, stretching from barcelona to trieste, and by new opportunities to the east. in the same week that the french government revealed its plans to spend 190 billion francs ($34 billion) on expanding its high-speed rail network, the prime minister announced that there will be no government subsidy for a fast train between london and the tunnel, in effect shelving plans for a much discussed new 70-mile link between london and folkestone. while the number of french shareholders in the project has risen from 210,000 to 436,000, the number of british investors has remained at 100,000 and while 15,000 kent residents marched on westminster in protest against the desecration of their villages, there was keen competition among french towns to have the new fast train service run through their region. despite the gift packs of french and english wine (more unfavorable comparisons) on sale just beneath the i dig the tunnel stickers at the eurotunnel exhibition centre, most britons seem to share, or will have to learn to live in regretful memory of, gladstone's view that england should be happy that the wise dispensation of providence has cut her off by that streak of silver sea... partly from dangers, absolutely from the temptations which attend upon the local neighbourhood of the continental nations.
