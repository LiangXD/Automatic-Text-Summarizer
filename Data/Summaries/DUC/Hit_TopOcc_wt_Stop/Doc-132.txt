among the men, paul davies-hale of england proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever. the race conditions were simply more bad luck for the 12th running of chicago's marathon, which has been fighting for respectability since losing its sponsor in 1986 and staging no race in 1987. no one who was in the lead pack at the halfway point, with the exception of montero, finished in the top five. davies-hale caught the second pack at 13 miles and met up with pre-race favorite steve binns, who lives 30 miles from davies-hale in england's west midlands. at 22 miles, davies-hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun. following him, and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were ravil kashapov of the soviet union, who was second in 2:13:19, and david long, also from the british midlands, who was third in 2:13:37. marathon notes race organizers insist that this race is at a world-class level, especially pointing to the world's richest purse.
