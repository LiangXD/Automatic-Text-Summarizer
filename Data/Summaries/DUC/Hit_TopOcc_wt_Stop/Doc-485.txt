when ms. leigh exits thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days inside an airtight, 17,000-cubic foot glass-and-steel structure, she will have been the longest inhabitant of a completely enclosed ecosystem, with air and water generated and recycled independently of earth's. scientists plan to place four men and four women inside a much larger sealed structure for two years to determine whether humans can duplicate earth's life systems for possible use in space. "the one thing that i really do miss is just companionship," ms. leigh said wednesday in a telephone interview from within the module, located on a ranch about 30 miles north of tucson. "i don't think that it's a matter of feeling lonely, but there's just something about direct human contact and sitting with somebody and pouring them a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and having that morning discussion it's very different than doing it over the phone or over the video," she said. 2, ms. leigh has been in frequent daily contact with her outside support team by telephone, video conference, two-way radio and just looking through the glass windows. two people also check her psychologically each day, ms. leigh said, "just to make sure that my state of mind or humor is normal." samples are passed through a special port for outside analysis, along with samples of waste water and her urine.
