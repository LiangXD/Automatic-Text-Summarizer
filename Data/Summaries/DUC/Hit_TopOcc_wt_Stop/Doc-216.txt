wildland firefighters, whose only protection is the cotton bandanna covering their faces, lose as much as 10% of their lung capacity after one routine season, and the damage persists for weeks, according to the studies by the california department of health services and the johns hopkins university school of hygiene and public health in baltimore. the worst doses of carbon monoxide and other hazardous chemicals, which can be fatal, are given off when fires smolder, the stage in which firefighters spend most of their time, said darold ward, a u.s. forest service chemist. for nearly 10 years, urban firefighters have known that toxic smoke from burning structures and cars greatly increases their chances of cancer and heart disease. it's a crime that we continue to let these guys function like this, said james johnson, director of hazard control projects at lawrence livermore national laboratory in northern california, which is developing respiratory gear for its firefighters. harrison said the forestry agencies and fire departments should at least warn their crews -- and potential recruits -- of the danger and consider rotating shifts more often to reduce smoke exposure. although the findings of the national studies have not yet been published, word has spread to top officials in the state forestry department, who say they are now starting to search for protection for the agency's 3,500 full-time firefighters and about 2,000 seasonal ones. air tanks and masks that are standard for fighting structural fires weigh 40 pounds and last only 15 to 30 minutes, so they are impractical for wildfire crews that hike miles carrying as much as 60 pounds of hoses and tools.
