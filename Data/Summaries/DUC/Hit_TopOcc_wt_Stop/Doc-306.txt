howard metzenbaum, d-ohio, said the senate judiciary committee, in confirming four justices without learning how they felt about abortion, has given them a free ride and should be tougher in ferreting out thomas' views. i will not support yet another reagan-bush supreme court nominee who remains silent on a woman's right to choose, and then ascends to the court to weaken that right, said metzenbaum, the only member of the judiciary committee who voted against thomas' nomination to the circuit court of appeals to the district of columbia. patrick leahy, d-vt., said in the past few months alone the supreme court is throwing out past decisions, and i think it is legitimate to ask judge thomas, what do you think of settled law, like roe vs. wade (legitimatizing abortion), what do you think of a woman's right to privacy, free speech issues, issues of freedom of religion. the fact that he is an african-american should not be a basis for avoiding very careful scrutiny of his civil rights record, said julius l. chambers, director of the naacp legal defense and education fund. the background of judge clarence thomas is less important than his views and what they mean to protecting our constitutional rights, said sen. when head of the eeoc during the reagan administration, thomas seemed to go out of his way to find ways to weaken some of the basic civil rights protections, said simon, a member of the senate judiciary committee. thomas said he looked forward to the confirmation process and to be an example to those who are where i was, and to show them that, indeed, there is hope.
