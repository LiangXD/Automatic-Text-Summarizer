state statutes that bar first-time candidates from running for congress have been held to add to the qualifications set forth in the constitution and have been invalidated. florida's attorney general has asked its state supreme court for an advisory opinion on a term-limit initiative that would limit the state's members of congress to eight consecutive years in office. they claimed there is a fundamental right to be a candidate for public office, which they found among the associational rights in the first amendment. they argued that voters were denied the right to be represented by the same legislator indefinitely, and that term limits discriminated against incumbents and denied them their right to equal protection of the laws. brown, the supreme court upheld a california law that prohibited an independent candidate from running for congress because he had changed his registration to independent less than 11 months before the election. in explaining that interest, the court recognized that there must be a substantial regulation of elections {by the states} if they are to be fair and honest, and if some sort of order is to accompany the democratic process. if they count only on the courts to safeguard their political castles, they may be in for a rude surprise. --- mr. mellor is president and general counsel of the institute for justice, a washington, d.c., litigation and educational organization.
