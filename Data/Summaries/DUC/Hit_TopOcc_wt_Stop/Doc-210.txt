the chambers of commerce in veurne and courtrai, along with the west flanders regional development authority in bruges, are gearing up to become part of what they refer to as the 'new european metropolitan area.' 'with the tgv and the chunnel this region, which was sort of in the corner of europe, will now be in the middle of a new developing area,' he says. the belgian chambers in the regions most directly affected believe there are two main areas for development: firstly, increasing traffic through western flanders as holidaymakers and freight carriers head towards the tunnel-opening in calais and secondly tourism. once this is done it will be possible to drive from russia to england without leaving a motorway, says mr philippe claerhout, chairman of the veurne chamber of commerce and industry. mr geert sanders, who works for the regional development authority of west flanders, says there is already evidence that the region's enhanced communications are attracting new businesses. there is, however, a danger that belgium will not make the most of the commercial opportunities - 'we will try to attract new industry, but our region is very small and our industrial zones are full,' says mr ludo verstraete, of the veurne chamber of commerce. west flanders is home to some of the best-known world war one battlefields, and promoters of the region insist that its large, open green spaces will, when properly developed, attract foreign visitors.
