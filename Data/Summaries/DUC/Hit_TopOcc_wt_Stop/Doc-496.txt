the four-star army general, who became national security adviser in 1987 and heads the u.s. forces command at fort mcpherson in atlanta, would become the first black to serve as the nation's senior military officer. "he was the general who guided preparations for the gorbachev summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the national security council following the iran-contra investigation, and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored confidence in the national security council itself," said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater. a senior administration official said in washington on wednesday that president bush is expected to name powell to the position. carlucci says that powell has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that reagan got powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the general had turned carlucci down several times. on the job, powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he became forscom commander. as leader of powell is responsible for the training and preparedness of more than 1 million active, reserve and national guard troops in the united states. "the soviets are going through wrenching historic change, beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system is broken and has to be changed," he said at his forscom installation.
