china stepped up the war of words over the future of hong kong yesterday, threatening to ignore the results of democratic elections proposed by mr chris patten, the colony's governor, once it assumes control in 1997. mr lu ping, china's senior official for hong kong affairs, said that if mr patten pressed ahead with his democratic reforms beijing would start a 'new kitchen' in 1997 - a chinese expression which means making a fresh start. mr lu also added his voice to personal criticism of the governor, saying that he would be condemned by history over his handling of the hong kong issue. the remarks by mr lu, head of china's hong kong and macao affairs office, were greeted with relief by the hong kong stock market, which had been bracing itself for a more uncompromising stand. the hang seng index was some 200 points down before mr lu's press conference, but recovered most of its losses to close at 5,958.33, down 21.7 on the day. we have to do this because the kitchen started by mr chris patten before 1997 will not converge with the stipulations of the basic law after 1997.' mr lu said china would have to make preparations ahead of 1997 for the cancellation of mr patten's proposed democratic reforms but he stopped short of saying china would set up an alternative administration in hong kong before the end of british rule.
