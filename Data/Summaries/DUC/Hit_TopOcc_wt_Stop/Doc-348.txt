few americans much notice that saddam hussein of iraq is accusing his small neighbors of harboring an "imperial-zionist plan" to drive down the price of oil. don't blame yourself if you missed the rumblings that were to suddenly put the united states on war footing and land a vast military force on the searing saudi desert, where american troops had never before been welcomed. what led to that, the quarrel between iraq and its little neighbor, kuwait, just seemed like another of those wrangles over oil production and pricing that occur before the meetings of opec sheiks and statesmen. july 18: a letter from saddam's foreign minister to the arab league accuses kuwait of having stolen $2.4 billion worth of petroleum over the past decade from an iraqi oil field along the two nations' disputed border. july 25: president hosni mubarak of egypt, seeking to carve out a peacemaker's role, says iraq and kuwait have agreed to send delegations to the saudi arabian summer capital of jiddah to discuss their differences. in washington, the house and senate defy bush administration opposition and vote for economic sanctions against iraq. the invasion seems to catch washington by surprise, but the cia takes the unusual step of issuing a statement saying it was not surprised and had "provided policy-makers with very useful and timely information."
