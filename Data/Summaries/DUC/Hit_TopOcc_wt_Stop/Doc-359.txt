since iraq's defeat, saddam has adjusted his cabinet twice, shifting the portfolios of longtime senior officials and promoting others known for their loyalty to him. in march, for example, he relinquished the title of prime minister and gave it to saadun hamadi, a shiite who has held several important positions in the baath government. publicly, saddam is seen on iraqi television presiding over meetings of the revolutionary command council and visiting villages, and he has promised his people to rebuild the country scores of times better than what the allied forces destroyed. iraq months of sanctions are taking their toll iraq's economy was severely damaged by the war, and the trade sanctions imposed by the united nations shortly after iraq invaded kuwait last august are starting to take a toll. the environment war leaves gulf in ecological ruins the environmental upheaval caused by the persian gulf war is of such proportion and complexity that the word disaster seems to trivialize it. last week, the government announced the extension of martial law for another month, and the prime minister ordered a crackdown on armed vigilantes who have been rounding up foreigners suspected of collaborating with iraqi occupation forces. the government itself has contributed to the tension, holding the first trials of alleged collaborators and handing out harsh sentences for apparently trivial crimes.
