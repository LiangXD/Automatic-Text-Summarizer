rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of gdp across the oecd between 1989 and 1992. while short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since the second world war. reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the oecd, as countries struggle to rein in government spending. rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families. real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would be needed to pay for pensions alone - and that on the assumption that the pensions do not increase in real terms. this ratchet effect has worried the group of seven leading industrial countries sufficiently for an employment summit to be hosted by president clinton in the coming months. and the demands put on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private provision of pensions and healthcare.
