a los angeles judge friday refused to reduce the $5-million bail for charles h. keating jr., saying the phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations. superior court judge gary klausner said keating -- pursued by creditors, regulators and prosecutors for his role in the failure of irvine-based lincoln savings &amp loan -- has significant reasons not to stay around. at the same time, klausner reduced bail for three keating co-defendants from the $1 million he imposed tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the former operators of american continental corp. and its former main subsidiary, lincoln. on wednesday, prosecutors said they were willing to recommend a reduction in bail to $1 million for keating and $50,000 for the others. while defense attorneys wouldn't say what they thought of the prosecutor's actions, other lawyers connected indirectly to the case scored reiner for allegedly using the case and his changing views on keating's bail to bolster his public image. klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper bail, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing were the most important in this case. keating and the others also have known they were targets of state and federal criminal investigations for a long time and would have fled the country by now if they had wanted to avoid prosecution, their attorneys said.
