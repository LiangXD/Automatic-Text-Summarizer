the uss vincennes' destruction of an iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake organization said sunday. "on the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the captain acted the best way he knew how," said william e. brooks jr., publisher of the vincennes sun-commercial newspaper and a member of the uss vincennes association. the current 9,600-ton vincennes was the third in a new class of guided missile aegis-type cruisers and was christened april 14, 1984, at pascagoula, miss., and commisioned on july 6, 1985. association member gene thurmond, 65, of evansville, served on the second uss vincennes, a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and sunk by japanese cruisers in 1942. the association's 500 members meet annually in vincennes to reminisce about their years of service and pay tribute to the dead, said vincennes liaison officer and honorary member, bill toth, 64. "there's no way of rectifying this kind of situation, so all we can do is remember these people," toth said. "from what i've heard about the ship, it's like everybody on it is family and they're trying to be the best in the navy," toth said.
