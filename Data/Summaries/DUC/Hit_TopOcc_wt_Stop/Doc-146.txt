what he had stumbled upon was village banking, a system of investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance their private enterprise, allowing them to create savings while paying interest and qualifying for bigger loans. the concept is similar to the one behind the grameen bank of bangladesh: channeling money to the impoverished, principally mothers, without the demands of commercial banks for collateral, so they can improve their families' lives. hatch, a one-time peace corps volunteer with a doctorate in economic development, is founder and president of the non-profit foundation for international community assistance, which recently moved its headquarters from tucson to alexandria, va. "we teach severely poor mothers how to create their own self-managed bank, which provides them with self-employment loans, provides them with savings incentives and provides them with a support group of mothers like themselves, so that they are all attacking change at the same time." their vehicle for improvement is the village bank, each comprised of 30 to 50 women who, through loans starting at $50, can earn enough to provide savings and create capital. "fifty percent or more are illiterate, and i would say 90 percent of them don't have any idea of what they're getting into when we start out," says hatch. hatch says he believes village banking has a role to play in reducing poverty along the mexican border and in slowing down migration to this country.
