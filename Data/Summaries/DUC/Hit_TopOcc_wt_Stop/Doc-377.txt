the earthquake that struck northern iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated soviet armenia in 1988. the armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the richter scale, but thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7 according to the u.s. geological survey. the quake struck an area of iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, needham said. the 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said. "iran is in a very active seismic region," he said, and that there have been many smaller quakes. twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in iran during the last 30 years, needham said. a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.
