the offending officer's police report indicated that the suspect's injuries were due to a fall from his bike and that he appeared unconscious, although he had also struggled against being handcuffed. but four citizens called to complain that they had witnessed the arrest and that the suspect not only was not struggling but also had been brutally beaten. according to the witnesses, the officer taunted the suspect, knelt on the suspect's stomach, beat him numerous times with his club and kicked him in his face. in response to another officer's inquiry, the original officer picked up the suspect, let his head fall to the pavement and said, it looks like he's dead. one of the problems in monitoring police brutality is that almost all victims of police abuse have themselves committed some kind of law violation. san jose police chief joseph macnamara recently referred to the los angeles incident as disgusting brutality and pointed out that the disturbing aspect was the failure of leadership and the code of silence. i agree with councilwoman blanca alvarado's suggestion and the san jose city council's decision to create a system where a city official will receive and track citizen complaints about the police.
