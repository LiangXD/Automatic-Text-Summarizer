yost, the top federal official tracking the environmental disaster, said exxon's plan was poorly drafted and lacking in specifics. in washington, consumer activist ralph nader said exxon "should not be allowed to forget" the spill and that a boycott would send the oil giant a message. he and others blasted exxon for failing to be prepared for the spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that fouled hundreds of miles of alaska's coast. "we are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil company that doesn't understand its responsibility to protect the environment," massachusetts state sen. however, he said the cleanup, to be paid for by the oil industry, could add $100 million to $500 million to alaska's economy, which he said is more than the effect of the fishing industry. exxon's 60-page, two-part revised strategy to cleanse some 364 miles of alaska's coastline of the oil spilled march 24 by the tanker exxon valdez was released monday. exxon's plan also notes that 191 miles of coastline it describes as "lightly oiled" may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally by wind and water.
