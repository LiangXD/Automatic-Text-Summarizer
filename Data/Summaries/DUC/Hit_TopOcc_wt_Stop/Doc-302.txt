freshman congressman larkin smith (r-miss.) died in a light plane crash in mississippi, authorities said monday, making him the second member of the house killed in an aviation accident in a week. smith and the pilot, charles vierling, who also was killed, were flying from hattiesburg to gulfport, according to federal and local officials. at the white house, spokesman marlin fitzwater said president and mrs. bush deeply regret smith's death, adding that smith, who was elected to a seat vacated by sen. smith, a former sheriff and police chief, was already developing a reputation on the house judiciary committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs. smith had thrown out the first ball at the dixie youth world series baseball tournament sunday and was heading home to gulfport, taking off at about 9:10 p.m. for the 35-minute flight. the statement said the plane, manufactured in 1973, and purchased by the institute last year, had a current inspection. gaston, who worked for smith nine years both in the sheriff's department and earlier when smith was gulfport police chief, called smith a pillar of strength.
