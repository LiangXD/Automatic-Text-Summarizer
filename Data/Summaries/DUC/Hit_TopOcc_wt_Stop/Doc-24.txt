the younger daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in his spring campaign, and after defeating black challengers in the primary and general election, he named minorities to 11 of his 21 cabinet positions. the racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a city council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks. "there's been no demonstrable change on the part of white leadership in this city to end racism," said bob starks, associate professor of inner city studies at northeastern illinois university. daley is filling the remaining two years of the term of the late harold washington, the city's first black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he died in november 1987. also last week, a human relations task force made up of business and civic leaders released a report saying racism in chicago was fueled by "a shocking lack of contact" between the city's ethnic groups. at the city council hearings thursday and friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs. among them was a 55-year-old grandmother, callie bryant, who testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police officers who gave her "the sign of the ku klux klan."
