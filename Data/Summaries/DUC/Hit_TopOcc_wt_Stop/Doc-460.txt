1. abandoning his from politics to politics stance, which is that politics is self-justifying and self-sufficient, patten has now woven politics into the lives of the people of hong kong, making it part and parcel of the local way of life and inseparable from the war on corruption, the rule of law, freedom, education, and the quality of governance -- all perennial concerns in chinese society. [passage omitted] now that patten has made politics an integral part of the life of the hong kong people and their institutions, can the chinese continue to counter it with the argument that it is all a matter of trust between nations? of course this is the stock in trade of politicians in every democratic country, but it also shows that the relationship between the ruler and the ruled under a democratic system is just what the people of hong kong need psychologically at this point in time. if they continue to insist that patten is guilty of the three violations and refuse to make adjustments and concessions, they would have a lot of ideological work to do on the hong kong people, besides giving patten a reason to withdraw from the talks. even more striking is the open dialogue and debate that took place in an atmosphere of freedom between patten and the people of hong kong on an equal plane after the governor presented his second annual report (in which the chinese authorities also played an active part). 7. in his annual report to the legislative council, patten noted subtly and not so subtly that where hong kong was free to make up its mind, things had gone well in the past year, but where consultation with china was necessary, nothing seemed to have worked well. (section 174) the reason is that we still have not been able to convince chinese officials that hong kong citizens' expectations about the development of their political system are in no way excessive but are reasonable and should be met, that they form part of the natural evolution of a society as it matures and becomes more sophisticated.
