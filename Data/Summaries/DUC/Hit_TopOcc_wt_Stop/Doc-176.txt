as hurricane gilbert's record-breaking fury sends caribbean islanders scrambling for cover, national hurricane center director bob sheets remained calm at his helm. the transition from former director neil frank, widely known for his distinctive style and flat-top haircut, to sheets, his dark blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a gray wool-blend jacket, has been smooth. a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale of strength has the potential for causing catastrophic damage with winds in excess of 155 mph and pressure below 27.17 inches. gilbert has been compared to the labor day hurricane of 1935, which slammed into the florida keys and killed 408 people, and hurricane camille, which devastated the mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256 _ the only other category 5 storms to hit land this century. the center's 33-member crew, including seven hurricane forecasters and specialists, are keeping a close watch on the hurricane in a large, open roomful of blue monitors flickering with graphics. and while sheets might appear to spend most of his day with tiny microphones snaking down his back and fielding media questions, he also writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts. sheets said he remains in touch with his predecessor, frank, but didn't get any special advice from his friend on dealing with his high-visibility post at the hurricane center here.
