elizabeth taylor is breathing with the assistance of a ventilator after undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said monday. the academy award-winning actress was admitted to st. john's hospital in santa monica last week for treatment of the pneumonia, and was listed in serious condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit on monday, her doctors said in a prepared statement. she is seriously ill and on sunday underwent a lung biopsy to further determine the cause of her pneumonia, the physicians' statement said. del favero said taylor's four children -- maria burton-carson, liza todd-tivey and christopher and michael wilding -- were with her at the hospital. taking a biopsy on the actress is called sutton's law in medicine, after legendary holdup man willie (the actor) sutton who said he robbed banks because that's where the money is, said dr. john g. mohler, a pulmonary disease specialist at the usc school of medicine. she suffered a near-fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, and mohler said it would seem that there is something basically wrong with her lung structure or function. emphasizing that he has no personal familiarity with the actress's case, mohler said he does not blame her doctors for being conservative.
