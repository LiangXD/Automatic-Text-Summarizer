a seriously ill elizabeth taylor battled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by a ventilator, doctors say. hospital officials described her condition late monday as stabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the pneumonia. while it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator, it does not mean that person is near death, said dr. john g. mohler, a university of southern california lung disease expert who emphasized he had no direct knowledge of miss taylor's condition. doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restore oxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathing difficulties have reduced those levels, mohler said. miss taylor has been plagued with health problems for years, particularly back troubles from filming of "national velvet' in 1945, when she fell off a horse. miss taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse at the betty ford clinic. during a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, miss taylor underwent a tracheotomy, an incision into her windpipe to help her breathe.
