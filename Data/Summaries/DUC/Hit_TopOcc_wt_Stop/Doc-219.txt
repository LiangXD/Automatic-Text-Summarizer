the chairman of the house agriculture committee says hearings are planned next year into how the u.s. forest service handled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the west, including one-third of yellowstone national park. de la garza said the hearings would focus on forest fire practices, and "can a catastrophe of that nature be avoided or was it a catastrophe?" "i was in montana and i visited with some people and i have some concern over some of the practices of the forest service," de la garza said in an interview last week. de la garza says the committee also plans dozens of hearings nationwide in preparation for the 1990 farm bill and will look at the u.s. department of agriculture's response to this year's drought-relief legislation. the committee will consider a uniform pesticide labeling law and legislation to protect ground water from agricultural pesticides and fertilizers, de la garza said. de la garza said he hopes the house interior committee, which has jurisdiction over the national park service, and the agriculture subcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the u.s. forest service, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, the worst in a century. drought conditions, high winds and a "tremendous build-up" of tinder, in yellowstone in particular, helped make the 1988 fires the worst in a hundred years, officials said.
