it's been described as the largest current civil engineering project, a multibillion dollar link that will help revolutionize europe's economy and physically end britain's historic isolation, a dream born in napoleon's day. "we will have the money to finish the project," says alastair morton, british deputy chairman of eurotunnel, the privately owned anglo-french company overseeing the work. "britain becomes branch line of europe," a guardian newspaper headline declared after the government announced june 14 that it would not fund a high-speed rail link between london and the british end of the tunnel. giant boring machines are digging three tunnels toward each other from folkestone, england and calais, france, with the first underground meeting expected in november in the service tunnel between the rail tunnels. eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent of britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the first year. in october, concern about the rising pricetag drove eurotunnel's banking syndicate to freeze funds for three months until the company reached a truce with trans-manche link, the consortium of 10 british and french contractors doing the construction, over responsibility for $1.7 billion in overruns. the french government, on the contrary, is spending roughly $2.8 billion building 210 miles of rail from paris to the tunnel, with a branch to brussels, where the ec is headquartered.
