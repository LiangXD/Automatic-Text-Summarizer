the root of the problems with congress is that, barring major scandal, it is almost impossible to defeat an incumbent. critics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not -- it's wrong to blame congress for the now nearly 100% re-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for. that takes money, and skewed campaign finance laws combined with taxpayer-paid junk mail effectively mean that only incumbents have the cash to make themselves known and to be taken seriously by the media. incumbents ended the 1988 elections with $63 million left over, while challengers were able to raise and spend a total of only $39 million. that's why the washington, d.c.-based americans to limit congressional terms is asking states to call for a constitutional amendment to limit terms. this fall, the group will try to get both incumbents and challengers to pledge they will not serve more than 12 years in office. they now think the voluntary service limitation of the past must be made mandatory.
