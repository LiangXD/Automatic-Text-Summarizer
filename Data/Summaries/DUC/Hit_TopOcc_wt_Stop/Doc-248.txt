the two million people of this picturesque alpine republic are waking up from their two-week nightmare sobered by the implications of their intoxicating declaration of secession from yugoslavia on june 25. their identity is being turned upside down once known as yugoslavia's developed north, slovenia will now be lumped together with western europe's underdeveloped south. almost every country on the continent has its own disenchanted minorities, from the soviet baltics to french corsica, that could be encouraged by the independence declarations of slovenia and the neighboring republic of croatia. soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has held up recent events here -- the yugoslav army assault on slovenia and the bitter ethnic clashes between croats and serbs -- as a warning to his land of what can happen when nationalism fractures a country. it's not size that makes a country successful, says josip skoberne, head of the international division of the slovene chamber of economy, citing ec-member luxembourg, far smaller in population and area than slovenia. unbelievable, scoffs mr. skoberne as he reads a letter telefaxed from the council of banja luka, a town with a large serbian population in the province of bosnia-hercegovina, decreeing that all slovene-owned assets in the city are to be inventoried and frozen. one of the major motivations behind slovenia's independence grab was to free itself from the yugoslav risk that hampered most attempts to attract foreign investment.
