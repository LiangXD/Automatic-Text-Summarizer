the statistics i used refer to latin america, the principal thrust of the argument of the bishop of oxford, which focused largely on brazil. to harp on alleged external causes of third world poverty diverts attention from the real factors behind this poverty which are domestic, and thereby from the possibilities of addressing these. these factors include, among others, government policies and extensive, often enforced, dependence on precarious subsistence production. state help for the poorest, especially the rural poor, conflicts with the political and personal interests of the rulers, and may not accord with local mores. an arab-dominated sudanese government will not help the poorest blacks hundreds of miles away with whom it is in armed conflict the sinhalese government will not help the tamil poor, nor will the government of ethiopia the poor of tigre. as i said in my letter, harping on alleged western causes of third world poverty reflects and reinforces feelings of guilt, which is a self-centred sentiment. encouraging third world countries to default inhibits the inflow of productive commercial capital, which, together with the skills that went with it, over the last 150 years transformed life in many poor countries, notably in south-east asia, west africa and latin america.
