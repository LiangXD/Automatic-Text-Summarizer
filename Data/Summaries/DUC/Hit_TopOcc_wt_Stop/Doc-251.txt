austria is insulated from the war-torn regions of croatia and bosnia-herzegovina, both once ruled by the austrian habs- burgs, thanks to its own 324 km-long border with slovenia. independence has, above all, brought peace to slovenia and left it free to implement the kind of rational market reforms and privatisation policies which remain blocked in the republics absorbed and impoverished by war further south. slovenia, with its self- contained infrastructure and proximity to western markets, was always by far the richest republic of the former federation. on the positive side of the balance sheet, however, the end of the federal state means that slovenia no longer has to contribute over dollars 1bn a year to finance the bloated yugoslav army or see its hard currency deposits 'frozen' by the national bank of yugoslavia, as happened before independence. the war, with its violent and deliberate displacement of millions of people, has and is taking place in the ethnically mixed border lands of croatia and bosnia relatively distant from the slovene border. both mr kucan and mr drnovsek, who headed the old revolving yugoslav state presidency for a year before negotiating the exodus of the federal army from slovenia in july 1991, criticise the failure of the west to intervene more forcibly to stop at an early stage what mr kucan calls 'the war of aggression waged by serbia.' meanwhile, the coalition government which emerged from last december's elections to the national parliament and parallel presidential elections, is determined to use its four-year mandate to complete the transformation of the country into a fully-fledged, market-orientated, multi-party parliamentary democracy.
