at the white house as elsewhere, vice president george bush's search for a running mate has people guessing _ and now one of their own is part of the guessing game. white house spokesman marlin fitzwater, asked what he thought of powell as a vice presidential prospect, said, "colin powell is a great american and would be an outstanding candidate for any position. later, as reagan bade farewell to visiting icelandic prime minister thorsteinn palsson in the white house east room, the question came up again. the most recent thing powell has said about his future was in a speech to the world affairs council of los angeles on july 19. the questions about his future were spurred by a column in wednesday's washington post by william raspberry suggesting that it would be a "brilliant idea" for bush to pick powell as his running mate. the congressman's press secretary, marci robinson, said kemp believes powell would be "an exciting choice" with the foreign affairs and other experience to be able to serve as president if necessary and that "politically speaking, it would hit the democrats at their strength." powell is the only current white house aide being mentioned as even a remote possibility to be bush's running mate, although former chief of staff howard h. baker jr. has been reported under consideration.
