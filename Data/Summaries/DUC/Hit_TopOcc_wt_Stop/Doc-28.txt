a few years ago chief gates referred to gang members as dirty little cowards, and warned them that there is resounding applause to every fall of the hammer. mr. gates's statement did nothing to lessen the tragedy of the fallen officer, but like his statement about blacks, it gave comfort to bigots within and outside the department. the unit had advance knowledge that crimes were about to occur, but often stayed outside and let robberies occur, even though innocent retailers and customers were put at risk. it is hard to imagine someone unlawfully beaten by uniformed officers as others looked on being inspired to respect law and order. public opinion polls in los angeles show the majority of people believe police brutality is common, and they disapprove of the way mr. gates has done his job. mr. gates's military style of policing is at odds with that in the rest of the country, and it's about time police leaders publicly repudiated it. it has cast a cloud over policing that won't be lifted until police chiefs drop their own code of silence and speak out against one of their own's peculiar philosophy of policing. --- mr. mcnamara is the police chief in san jose.
