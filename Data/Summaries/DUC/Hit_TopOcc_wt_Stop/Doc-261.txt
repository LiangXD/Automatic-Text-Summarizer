in the late 1970s, poor farmers living in communities surrounding this small town began replacing their fields of cacao and coffee with coca to meet the growing u.s. demand for cocaine. like thousands of other farmers in peru's upper huallaga valley, they discovered that while cacao and coffee could give their families enough to eat, coca could make them rich. government officials from the anti-drug police (umopar) and the coca-eradication unit (corah) sent into the region to wipe out drug production were often confined to their barracks by the army they simply were not allowed to carry on with their work. anti-drug police, upper huallaga residents and interior ministry officials report that army officers received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs from drug lords for their help in keeping anti-drug officials at bay. the commander of the anti-drug police, gen. juan zarate, says there are few guerrillas in the upper huallaga and denies that an alliance exists between the drug traffickers and the shining path. the government's problem in combatting the current violence and influence of the shining path is how to ensure that army troops sent into this coca-rich region won't become corrupted by the lure of drug money, as they reportedly did in the past. this is the catch-22 that now confounds peruvian and u.s. officials trying to eradicate both drugs and guerrillas from peru. --- mr. bridges is a free-lance writer.
