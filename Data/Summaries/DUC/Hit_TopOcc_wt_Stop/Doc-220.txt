for two months last summer the citizens of cooke city and its tiny suburb, silver gate, were showcased on the nightly tv news and splashed across the front pages of the nation's newspapers as forest fires threatened to burn them out. their economically critical summer tourist season a bust and the hunting season crippled, the folks of silver gate and cooke city straggled home in mid-september to pick up the pieces. the u.s. forest service, which coordinated some of its firefighting efforts from cooke city, set up shop near the photocopy machine, and everybody who had information or was seeking some crammed into the smiths' log cabin office. the only grocery store is on its winter schedule, open just friday through monday, and many curio shops are shut up tight, but the bearclaw cabins and most of the other motels are open for winter sports enthusiasts. it's snowmobiling season now, and clubs from as far away as canada and illinois are booked into cooke city's motels to take advantage of the beautiful scenery and 80 miles of trails in the area. because of the unprecedented fire season which burned nearly 1.5 million acres in the greater yellowstone ecosystem, including 705,000 acres within the national park, mrs. smith and her friends and neighbors worry about what's happening underneath the blanket of snow this winter. "it's not the sort of thing to be concerned about, it would only be a matter of curiosity and interest because the fires are still under suppression orders and they would be mopped up and put out immediately, i'm sure," said norum, who is based at the boise interagency fire center in idaho.
