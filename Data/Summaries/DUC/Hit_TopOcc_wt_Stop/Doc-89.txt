a poor ventilation system that does little more than recycle old, stale air from one end of the building to another. that's because, in today's modern office buildings, recirculated air can mean recycled flu and other airborne infections. the evidence comes from various studies of tuberculosis, measles and flu that spread in a manner that can only be explained by poor air ventilation. nor is it to blame for last month's outbreak in richmond of legionnaire's disease -- an illness caused by a bug linked to wet, damp spaces rather than poor ventilation. in a study published in the august issue of the american review of respiratory diseases, nardell and colleagues at harvard medical school found that an outbreak of tuberculosis documented in one unidentified government building could have been cut in half had the ventilation been better. in the study, nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis. nardell and others recognize that the solution to this problem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air -- can be expensive.
