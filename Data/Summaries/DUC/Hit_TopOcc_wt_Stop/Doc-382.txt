if you go on a job interview today and are asked to take a lie detector test, the chances are you would be the victim of an illegal act. the same situation applies if your boss has a polygraph examiner come into the warehouse tomorrow to hook wires to randomly selected employees and question them about merchandise missing from the company's shelves. these restrictions on lie detectors, whose accuracy has long been under attack, are enumerated in a federal law that took effect tuesday, six months after it was signed by president reagan. any such polygraph exam would have to be conducted under strict conditions, with no questions about personal beliefs and sexual behavior, and the exam results alone could not be used as a basis for discipline or a refusal to hire. "complaints about polygraph abuse and firings based on polygraph abuse have been one of the single largest sources of calls to aclu offices nationwide," goldberg said. goldberg said employers in the following states, which allow businesses to request people to take lie detector tests, could be affected by the new law: california, hawaii, idaho, maryland, montana, nebraska, pennsylvania and wisconsin. the remaining 14 states and the district of columbia have laws banning polygraph examinations for employment purposes, and these laws take precedence over the new federal statute if they are more restrictive, according to goldberg.
