canadian ben johnson left the olympics today "in a complete state of shock," accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal. in a middle-of-the-night meeting with olympic and canadian officials, family members, coach and manager, johnson, 26, forfeited his most prized possession, the medal he'd had in his hands for only three days. "he appeared to be in a complete state of shock and not comprehending the situation," said canada's chief of mission, carol anne letheren. "this is a blow for the olympic games and the olympic movement," said international olympic committee president juan antonio samaranch. in canada, prime minister brian mulroney said the scandal was a "personal tragedy for ben and his family. he said the sprinter's once-favored status as a hero to many sports fans in canada, his native jamaica, and around the world now will be tarnished. johnson's name will go down in olympic history with other athletes who lost their gold medals, such as decathlete jim thorpe in 1912 because he played semi-pro baseball and swimmer rick demont in 1972 because he took an asthma medicine.
