the reagan administration moved to deal with the worsening drought, and a top trade official said that farm export subsidies may have to be curbed. white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that the president is very concerned about the drought, and wants to make certain that everything that the federal government can do to assist will be done. before the drought began damaging crops this month, the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers. it's already getting harder to sell farmers tractors because of the drought, says james k. ashford, case president and chief executive officer. paul prentice of farm sector economics associates, a forecasting concern, thinks the drought could so deplete u.s. stockpiles that the agriculture department would drop much of its farm crisis-era planting restrictions. others, however, see little chance that recession-weary farmers would be willing to take the risk of planting fence-row to fence-row like they did a decade ago. the decision by mr. lyng, the secretary of agriculture, to allow hay-mowing for 30 days on conservation reserve program land came as farmers and ranchers in north dakota, minnesota and other states continued to sell off livestock in response to shortages of hay and other forage crops.
