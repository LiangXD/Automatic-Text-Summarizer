supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path hurricane hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast. "all the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models," said thomas pyke, head of national oceanic and atmospheric administration's satellite service. hurricane specialist gil clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships. information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night. using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland, md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane. to determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane. "most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job," emmanuel said.
