abimael guzman, founder of the rebel movement, has said of the slums and their people: "the immense masses of the shantytowns are like belts of steel that lock in the enemy and hold back his reactionary forces." his maoist rebels, once secretive fanatics, are becoming a political force that seeks public support in huaycan and the other makeshift communities where two-thirds of lima's 7 million people scrape along. the guerrillas also work with drug traffickers in peru's eastern jungle, source of the raw material for much of the world's cocaine, and buy sophisticated weapons with the profits. more than 12,000 people have been killed in the civil war, most of them andean peasants slain by rebels or security forces, and official figures put damage to the shattered economy at $10 billion. "sendero is seeking semi-legal status as a way of winning militants and sympathizers, while at the same time generating a confusing situation in which the security forces indiscrimately repress members of the legal left along with leftist insurgents," a ranking police official said privately. according to counterinsurgency experts, the guerrillas switched their emphasis to the cities because migration of indian peasants to urban centers accelerated after the highlands became a battlefield. huaycan is one of the slums where shining path works hardest because it is just off the central highway, a strategic route through the capital's main industrial zone to the mountains.
