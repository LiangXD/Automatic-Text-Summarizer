this could be only the beginning, said raymundo punongbayan, director of the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology. they said most of the debris flowed into the marella, maraunot and o'donnell rivers and that there had been no reports that property or homes had been damaged. at a refugee center in olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors told of the sky growing dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed by a rain of ash. ash was so thick in the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights and windshield wipers on. the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology said the explosions occurred at 10:52 p.m. and 11:05 p.m. seismologists said the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could come later. punongbayan said tuesday that the site was in the path of the volcanic flow from mount pinatubo during its last major eruption, in 1380.
