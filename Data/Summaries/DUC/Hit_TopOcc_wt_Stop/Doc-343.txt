the trans-antarctica expedition mr. steger writes about in crossing antarctica (knopf, 304 pages, $25) was born of the ambitions of mr. steger and jean-louis etienne, who met in 1986 in the middle of separate arctic journeys. mr. steger was leading the first confirmed unsupported dog-sled expedition to the north pole and dr. etienne was making the first solo ski there. the success of trans-antarctica owed a lot to the pride, resilience, determination and widely different skills and personalities of the men involved: geoff somers, stubborn, taciturn and wryly humorous, an expert dog-sled driver and veteran of the british antarctic survey victor boyarsky, a boisterous, mercurial, soviet glaciologist keizo funatsu, a quiet, conscientious japanese with spiritual reserves, devoted to his dogs and qin dahe, a dedicated chinese scientist. when i traveled with these men and their dog teams for three days in the minnesota wilderness in february 1989, it was mr. qin's first experience with skis, sled dogs or communicating at length in the english language. none of that bothered mr. steger, who was more interested in mr. qin's fierce determination to share camp chores and pull his weight in subzero cold. storms slowed them early and confined them to their tents for days on the antarctic peninsula and buried some food caches irretrievably under drifts of snow, gravely imperiling the expedition. within 16 miles of the end, mr. funatsu stepped out in a storm to tend his dog team and couldn't find his way back.
