here is the text of president bush's address to the people of iraq, as released by the white house: i'm here today to explain to the people of iraq why the united states and the world community has responded the way it has to iraq's occupation of kuwait. my purpose is not to trade accusations, not to escalate the war of words, but to speak with candor about what has caused this crisis that confronts us. twenty-seven states, rich and poor, arab, muslim, asian and african, have answered the call of saudi arabia and free kuwait and sent forces to the gulf region to defend against iraq. nor, until the invasion of kuwait, has the united states been opposed to iraq. in fact, the occupation of kuwait is helping no one and is now hurting you, the iraqi people, and countless others of the world's poor. the united nations has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish the iraqi people, but as a peaceful means to convince your leadership to withdraw from kuwait. when iraq returns to the path of peace, when iraqi troops withdraw from kuwait, when that country's rightful government is restored, when all foreigners held against their will are released, then, and then alone will the world end the sanctions.
