the clinton administration will soon announce support for a north american development bank, which would fund projects in communities hit by job losses resulting from the north american free trade agreement. agreement by the administration is expected to bring mr torres and at least 7 other hispanic congressmen into the pro-nafta fold. the administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-nafta votes, out of the 218 needed. it is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants a reason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it is pushing feverishly to turn anti-nafta public opinion around. state by state, undecided congressmen are being lured to the white house for intimate briefings, as are business leaders and journalists. members of the cabinet are being sent to congressional districts, where they visit and publicise factories that are expected to gain jobs if nafta passes. president bill clinton on wednesday gave his second impassioned speech on nafta at an exhibit on the white house lawn of products likely to benefit from nafta.
