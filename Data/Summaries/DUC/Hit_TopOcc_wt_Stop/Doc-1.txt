"mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. "i think it is a recognition _ not just of pressure from farmers _ but that the public would feel more confident that no bse-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100 percent compensation," said sir simon gourlay, president of the national farmers union. because of the disease, the u.s. department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from great britain in july, said margaret webb, a usda spokeswoman in washington. similar embargoes have been imposed by australia, finland, israel, sweden, west germany and new zealand, according to the agriculture ministry, and the european community has proposed a ban on exports of british cattle older than 6 months. the report said the disease was impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it did not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies. "it is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of bse on human health," a consultative committee reported to the agriculture ministry. the committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that bse was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.
