a few days ago, palestinian ahmad mahmud 'abd-al-karim, a prominent frc official, arrived in lebanon from finland on the special mission of following up the investigations the lebanese authorities are conducting with the palestinians from the abu-nidal group who are accused of the assassination of jordanian first secretary na'ib al-ma'ayitah in beirut on 29 january. reports confirm that shortly after arriving in beirut, ahmad 'abd-al-karim left for the frc's al-rawdah camps in western al-biqa' from where he followed the investigation through reports sent to him by people who secretly work for the frc and who provided him with information in exchange for generous sums of money. the security information the investigators have collected on the al-ma'ayitah assassination shows that as soon as the imyo was exposed, jordanian fundamentalist elements belonging to various organizations such as muhammad's army, the islamic liberation army, and the imyo and others moved to neighboring arab countries. iran managed to recruit frc members to work in the jordanian fundamentalist extremist organizations by taking advantage of the hostility the abu-nidal group has harbored against jordan and its regime and king ever since the group was expelled from the country. the security agencies' information suggests that al-bishtawi fled to burj al- barajinah camp after the crime and then moved to cyprus where he joined jordanian fundamentalist elements living there with tunisian fundamentalists from the rachid ghanouchi-led al-nahdah movement. jordanian security officials traveled to lebanon and cooperated with lebanese officers in the investigations that led to revealing all the details and the arrest of more than 30 members of abu-nidal group in jordan. it also hastened to send one of its officials to lebanon to follow the investigation and try to lessen its repercussions out of fear that al-ma'ayitah's assassination may be one of the fatal mistakes committed by the frc and may negatively affect the organization's future in lebanon and jordan.
