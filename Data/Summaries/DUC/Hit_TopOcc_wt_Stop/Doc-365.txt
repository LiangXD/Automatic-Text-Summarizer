in his five years on the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia, judge bork has heard eight cases involving the rights of minorities or women -- and ruled in their favor in seven. when the critics ask, where was robert bork during the great civil-rights victories? the best answer is that he was standing in front of the supreme court making the winning arguments. indeed, perhaps the best measure of robert bork's civil-rights record is his four years as the government's chief litigator. in 17 of the 19 cases, solicitor general bork argued for the civil rights plaintiff or minority interest the naacp legal defense fund was on his side in nine of the 10 cases where both filed briefs. in his 1971 indiana law review article, then-yale prof. bork said that the 14th amendment was intended to enforce a core idea of black equality against governmental discrimination. the civil rights act of 1964 did an enormous amount to bring the country together and bring blacks into the mainstream, he said at his 1973 confirmation hearings as solicitor general. a reading of judge bork's voluminous cvil rights record leaves the inescapable conclusion that the partisan campaign against him was one of intentional distortion.
