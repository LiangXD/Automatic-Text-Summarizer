more than 200 relatives of people killed when a u.s. warship shot down an iranian airliner a year ago have sued the makers of the ship's radar system, a spokesman said sunday. nagib ghafoor said the suit was filed june 28 in u.s. district court in san francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 of the 290 victims. the jetliner was on a commercial flight from the iranian city of bandar abbas, where a large air base is located, to dubai in the southern united arab emirates. pentagon analysts have said split-second decisions aboard the vincennes were affected by the inability of radar operators to immediately match the plane's radar trace with digital direction, altitude and speed information displayed on another screen. ghafoor said the complaint charged that the radar equipment indicated the aircraft approaching the vincennes was an f-14, diving in an attack mode at an altitude of 4,000 feet, rather than the iran air flight, which was climbing. he did not mention any figure for the compensation sought but said the group would be guided by the amount of compensation the iraqi government paid the families of american sailors killed in an iraqi air strike on the u.s. frigate stark in the persian gulf on may 16, 1987. iraq has agreed to pay $27.3 million to the families of 37 u.s. crewmen killed aboard the stark, meaning each family would receive around $740,000.
