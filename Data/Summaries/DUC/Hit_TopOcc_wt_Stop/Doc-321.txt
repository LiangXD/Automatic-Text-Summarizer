but in a jammed courtroom in manhattan's federal courthouse, wood said that milken, 44, who has been accused, among other things, of helping to bring on the national savings and loan disaster, could not be blamed for all of the financial excesses of the 1980s. several lawyers said they interpreted the long sentence as an attempt by the judge to ensure that milken cooperates fully, revealing whatever incriminating information he knows about corporate raiders, junk bond buyers and former co-workers. she said there was insufficient evidence to prove that milken was behind a manipulation of wickescos. stock in 1986. she said the government also did not prove its claim that milken was guilty of insider trading in caesars world securities in 1983, and also failed to show that he had illegally made lucrative investment opportunities available to employees of investment funds as inducements to get them to buy riskier securities for their funds. james slade, a spokesman for the federal bureau of prisons, said that under justice department rules, the 10-year term makes it unlikely that milken will be allowed to serve his sentence in a minimum-security federal prison camp. april 13, 1989: drexel and the sec announce a settlement of the government 's civil fraud case against the firm that subjects drexel to federal monitoring for three years and forces it to sever ties with milken. october 1990: special two-week hearing to consider the government's array of charges against milken, ordered by u.s. district judge kimba wood to gain greater insight into milken's character in order to fashion a fair sentence for the six counts he admitted.
