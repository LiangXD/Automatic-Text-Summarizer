there will be no more talk of crisis, says alastair morton, chief executive officer of eurotunnel plc, the consortium building the cross-channel link. but the lack of a high-speed rail link to london, and improved service beyond, means britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits. there is a danger of not being able to exploit the tunnel to its full potential, says prof. christopher nash, a transport expert at leeds university in northern england. as a result of thursday's decision, the journey time to london from paris will be about three hours -- 30 minutes longer than with a high-speed rail link. the traffic will now speed through as far as our side of the tunnel, and then the men with red flags will lead it on to london, complains keith speed, a conservative member of parliament whose constituency is near the tunnel terminal. the tunnel-building consortium argues that only 39% of its total revenue will come from direct london-to-paris trains the real money-spinner will be freight traffic hauled by road to the tunnel, then loaded onto special eurotunnel wagons for the journey under the channel. a high-speed link which covers {only} part of the route proves to be fairly uncompetitive with other transportation modes, says bill steinmetz, vice president of transport for consultants booz-allen &amp hamilton inc. in london.
