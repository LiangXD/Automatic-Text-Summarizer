the man who would have been a member of the u.s. supreme court and was stingingly rebuffed by the senate is quick to smile at the irony the last two years have brought. he says he is taking his case to a higher court, the american public and the next generation. one reason why is that robert bork, former marine, former practicing lawyer, former yale professor of law, former solicitor general, former professor at yale again, former judge of the u.s. circuit of appeals, is now a best-selling writer. to his surprise, "the tempting of america, the political seduction of the law," has been on the best-seller list for more than 10 weeks, and there are more than 190,000 copies in print. "i hope in the same way to have some effect with this one," he says, pointing out the antitrust book had a greater impact than a few opinions he might have handed down from the bench. during the hearings, bork was astonished to learn that a radio reporter had gone to the video store he frequents and obtained a list of all of the tapes he had rented. his colleagues include irving kristol, publisher of the national interest, former u.n. ambassador jeane kirkpatrick, former state department arms negotiator richard perle and political, economic and social commentators such as ben wattenberg, michael novak, norman ornstein and walter berns.
