more than 30 years ago, life magazine took a look at the burgeoning little desert town of las vegas and wondered if it wasn't overbuilt. las vegas has grown from a dusty town of a few resorts into a booming metropolis of more than 600,000 people, with nearly 60,000 hotel and motel rooms to accomodate tourists. "there is still a tremendous amount of demand out there that hasn't been satisified," said rossi ralenkotter, director of marketing for the las vegas convention and visitors authority. nearly 20,000 new hotel rooms either are under construction or awaiting groundbreaking, as resorts compete to add rooms they hope will bring in even more tourists and gamblers in the near future. visitor volume nearly has doubled in the last 12 years, with an estimated 17 million tourists each expected to spend an average of 2-3 days in las vegas during 1988. when finished sometime late next year, the $550 million resort will have 3,200 guest rooms set in a watery tropical setting that hotel officials claim will be like nothing las vegas has ever seen. the city's hotels in the past four to five years have begun exploiting the vast middle-class and tourism markets they once eschewed in favor of attracting a handful of high-rolling gamblers.
