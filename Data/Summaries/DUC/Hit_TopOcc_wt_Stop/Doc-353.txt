claiming support from iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz, a soviet spokesman said the plan envisioned a total withdrawal within 21 days of a cessation of hostilities. shortly after bush issued the allied ultimatum, a soviet spokesman in moscow announced a new six-point set of provisions he said were agreed to by aziz for a withdrawal from kuwait. the provisions include iraqi withdrawal from kuwait within 21 days of a cease-fire and supervision of the withdrawal by the united nations, vitaly ignatenko said. ignatenko said the plan had been passed on to baghdad and that a final response to it from the iraqi leadership was anticipated. among the requirements for iraq, said fitzwater, was that withdrawal from kuwait city must be complete within 48 hours and from the country of kuwait in one week. bush's statement was his first public response to a soviet-brokered peace plan -- an effort the president said he appreciated, even while he declared that it attached unacceptable conditions on an iraqi withdrawal. lee hamilton, d-ind., said the proposed peace plan had very positive aspects but also plenty of things wrong with it, chiefly a call for lifting sanctions on iraq.
