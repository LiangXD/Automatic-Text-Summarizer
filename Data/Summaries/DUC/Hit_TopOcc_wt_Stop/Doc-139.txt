that is the vexing question facing mr lewis preston, the former chairman of j p morgan, the new york bank, who takes over as president of the world bank this september. few in washington now doubt that the bank is needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern europe and the middle east, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems: grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bn people live on less than dollars 1 a day. mr preston's first challenge, says mr mistry, will be to wrest control of the bank from messrs stern and qureshi his second, to prune legions of 'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience. 'the brady plan is enough,' says mr williamson, if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt. mr flickner of the senate budget committee says the issue is not whether to insist on westminster-style democracy but whether the form of governance is such that 'loans will benefit the majority of the people'. the challenge for mr preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital. mr summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.
