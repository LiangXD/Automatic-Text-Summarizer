mr lewis preston, world bank president, yesterday promised to strengthen the bank's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries. however, he failed to respond to demands from the clinton administration for the bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending that should have an explicit poverty focus. in congressional testimony this week, mr lloyd bentsen, us treasury secretary, said the us wanted to see more funding that 'will create social and economic safety nets' for poor people most affected by war, civil strife and economic mismanagement. the share of bank lending allocated for 'human resource development' is still only 14 per cent, in spite of repeated calls from mr preston for an increased emphasis on investment in people. at a news conference mr preston said the bank was making progress: a decade ago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development and only 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus on poverty. while he expected an increase in the share of bank lending aimed at poverty relief, he declined to set precise targets for bank staff. he said hoped for a clear signal from this week's meeting of the group of seven leading industrial countries that they would deliver on commitments for a dollars 18bn replenishment of resources for the international development agency (ida), the centrepiece of bank efforts to reduce poverty.
