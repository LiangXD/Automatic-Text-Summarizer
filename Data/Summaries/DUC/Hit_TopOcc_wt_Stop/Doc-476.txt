last year alone, nine states and the district of columbia raised their minimum wage above the current federal level, and this year new york, new jersey and pennsylvania are considering doing the same. furthermore, the district of columbia, like many states, has a subminimum, or training wage, of $3.35 for employees in some job categories who are under age 18. another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05. a minimum wage of $5.05 would require even the high-minimum-wage states of california and connecticut to increase their mandated minimums by 19%. nonetheless, both republican and democrat members of congress from high-wage states will likely find it difficult to vote against raising the federal minimum wage, since raising it would equalize wage costs among states and increase the competitiveness of labor in high-minimum-wage states. the advantage of allowing state or regional differences in minimum-wage levels is that the appropriate minimum wage for connecticut might force massive layoffs in texas. proponents of a federal increase argue that recent state increases signal grassroots support of the current minimum-wage bill before congress.
