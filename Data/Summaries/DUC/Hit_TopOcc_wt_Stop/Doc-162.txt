leak a mere trickle a representative of the u.s. fish and wildlife service said the tanker had been spilling oil at a rate of 10,000 barrels an hour but the coast guard said the leak had become a mere trickle by 2:30 p.m., alaska time. u.s. coast guard petty officer john gonzales said in a telephone interview from valdez that the spill was staying in the mid-channel and did not seem to be moving toward the shore. he said three planes from british columbia, california and england had been dispatched to the scene for aerial spraying to dilute the oil. another exxon tanker was attempting to pump the oil out of the crippled vessel, and two coast guard investigators were on board the valdez, he said. jon nelson, a deputy regional director of the u.s. fish and wildlife service in anchorage, said the reef ripped a 150-foot gash in the vessel, which was carrying 1.2 million barrels of oil, and there was fear that the tanker could break apart further. it's of concern for two reasons: one is the size of the spill and that this is such a sensitive, very productive area, said lisa speer, senior staff scientist with the natural resources defense council in new york. he said that state officials were considering the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the oil.
