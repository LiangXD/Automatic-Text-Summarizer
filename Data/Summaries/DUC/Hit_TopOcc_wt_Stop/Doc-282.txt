hispanics who have strong american indian ancestry may be vulnerable to diabetes because about 50 percent of all indians develop diabetes, mcnamara said. also, the high-fat diet of many hispanics leads to obesity, which seems to trigger diabetes, mcnamara said. the clinic saturday will focus on three ways to manage diabetes -- diet, exercise and medication. participants will learn that traditional dishes can be just as tasty -- but healthier -- when made with unsaturated fats, and that exercise will reduce weight, which in turn will lower the possibility of contracting diabetes. the hospital and the diabetes society are sponsoring neighborhood diabetes programs for hispanics, which are taught by bilingual instructors. if you're interested the diabetes management program for hispanics will be from 9 a.m. to noon at st. louise health center, 18500 st. louise drive, off cochrane road in morgan hill. if you're interested the diabetes management program for hispanics will be from 9 a.m. to noon at st. louise health center, 18500 st. louise drive, off cochrane road in morgan hill.
