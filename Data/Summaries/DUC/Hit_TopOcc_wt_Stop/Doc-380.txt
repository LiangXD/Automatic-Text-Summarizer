rosenfeld's lie detector picks up brain-wave activity through electrodes attached to the scalp, amplifying the signals and feeding them into a computer, which coordinates the information and displays it on a video screen. "if sensory information has a special meaning for you... then your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the p3 wave," he said. polygraphs measure the physical expression of emotions _ pulse, sweating, blood pressure and breathing, he said. advertising researchers have measured p3 waves to better gauge what consumers want instead of what they say they want, and psychiatrists can detect certain disorders, such as attention deficits, by measuring them, he said. rosenfeld has worked on the detector for almost four years and says it could be widely used within three more. "it's a perfectly valid way of detecting lies," said sidney weinstein, a professor of neurology at new york university college of medicine in new york city and editor of the danbury, conn.-based neuroscience journal. however, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would need a great deal more training, weinstein said.
