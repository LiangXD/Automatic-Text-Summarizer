in his state of the union address last january, president reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years. americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty. if the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last january, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is. the president and the governors should be natural allies on this issue, and the chances of success would be enhanced if they could jointly commit themselves to a plan of action. this past december, a coalition of some 80 organizations, most with headquarters in washington, issued a statement of principles calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs. with the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press congress to move off the deadening status quo. with the ball in its court, congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors, or it can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor.
