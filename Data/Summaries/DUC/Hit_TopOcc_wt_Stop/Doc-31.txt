while the commission stopped short of blaming chief gates for these problems, it said that no chief should serve more than two consecutive five-year terms, and that mr. gates, having served 13 years, should therefore turn in his badge following a transition period. nearly one-quarter of 650 officers responding to a commission survey agreed that racial bias on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and community, and in some cases may lead to the use of excessive force, the report said. but the commission called for a shift away from the force's paramilitaristic, us-against-them style, and said the department must embrace the community-based policing style that encourages officers to spend less time in their cars and more time interacting with citizens in the communities they serve. this report will be a must-read for police chiefs around the country, said hubert williams, executive director of the police foundation, a washington, d.c., law enforcement research group. it also should be reconstituted with members not linked with the current controversy, in the interest of a fresh start. -- a major overhaul of the police disciplinary system and the process used by citizens to file complaints against lapd officers, especially in excessive force cases, is needed. however, the commission didn't address how los angeles would pay for this major overhaul, though mr. christopher said that when you see the costs of settlements accelerating in police misconduct lawsuits as they have in recent years, i'm not sure there will be a net cost increase to implement the changes. one officer who had seven complaints against him that had been sustained -- as well as numerous others that hadn't been -- was described in his performance evaluation this way: his contacts with the public are always professional and positive and his attitude with the citizens is one of concern.
