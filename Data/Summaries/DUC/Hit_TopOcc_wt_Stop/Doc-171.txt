exxon officials monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of alaskan coastline fouled by the nation's largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a suspension of local environmental laws. the plan makes no provisions for continuing the cleanup beyond mid-september, and notes that 191 miles of lightly oiled coastline may not be cleaned mechanically at all, but be allowed to be washed naturally by the environment. the oil company's strategy, which was submitted to state and federal authorities only hours before a deadline expired, divides alaska's oil-tainted shores into four categories _ from the most heavily polluted to those that are "only lightly oiled." the worst areas _ three miles of sludge-covered beaches on several small islands _ would be targeted immediately, with the others scheduled for gradual cleansing through sept. 15. exxon's plan calls for the recovered waste to be strained for usable oil that can be refined, and said the oil-laced wastewater could be treated at the alyeska pipeline service co.'s disposal plant in valdez. bane said an aerial survey showed an amorphous oil patch 10 miles wide and more than 20 miles long in the shelikof strait, which is located along the migration route used by whales. the attorneys general of idaho, oregon and washington state scheduled a news conference tuesday to call for a federal investigation into the sharp rise in the price of gasoline since the spill.
