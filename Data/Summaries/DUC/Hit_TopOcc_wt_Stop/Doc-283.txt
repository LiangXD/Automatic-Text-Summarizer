that is why the american diabetes assn. and other health education groups in the los angeles area and california have begun a major push to educate latinos about diabetes. like heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among latinos is a condition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors say. latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are anglos, and incidence of the disease increases with age. for instance, the fact that type ii diabetes frequently shows up in women during or shortly after pregnancy gives health educators an ideal chance to influence an entire latino family's eating habits, said dr. martin montoro, co-director of the diabetes and pregnancy service at los angeles county-usc medical center. chief among these is that the latino patient is less likely to volunteer information or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the anglo patient, said dr. aliza lifshitz, a board member of the california hispanic american medical assn. any physician practicing in southern california needs to be aware of that and to learn to ask more diabetes-related questions of their latino patients, lifshitz said. diabetes complications according to the american diabetes assn., in the united states every year: * 150,000 people die of diabetes and its complications * 5,000 people go blind because of diabetes * 10% of all cases of kidney disease necessitating dialysis were caused by diabetes * 45% of all non-traumatic amputations of the leg and foot were caused by diabetes * heart disease is 2 to 4 times more likely in people with diabetes
