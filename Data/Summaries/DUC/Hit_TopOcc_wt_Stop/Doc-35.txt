solar telescopes yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western north america. "there was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature," said ed krupp, director of griffith observatory in los angeles, where 600 children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 percent of the sun's surface at 10:50 a.m. "it's kind of neat," said map maker jan mayne, who was among dozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar telescopes at the california institute of technology in pasadena. as the moon passed between the earth and sun to cause the partial eclipse, those watching through caltech's telescopes could see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun. the eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a diagonal line stretching roughly from mazatlan, mexico, northeast to dallas and chicago. several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets in downtown anchorage, alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the sun at 9:13 a.m. in san francisco, the moon eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 9:52 a.m., but the event wasn't visible because of clouds that were so thick they delayed arriving flights at the airport.
