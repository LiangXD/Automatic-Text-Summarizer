with the decline of communism, u.s. development groups believe they are exporting free-market economics to tiny businesses that can fuel growth in the developing world. isaac btesh, a director and son of the founder, says the bank has lent $80,000 to 100 people so far on 60-day, rotating lines of credit -- with a 100% repayment rate. poverty lending has such promise that multi credit plans to make it the bank's number one activity, ahead of trade financing, consumer loans and merchant loans, the official adds. accion, a cambridge, mass.-based nonprofit international development group and a leader in the u.s. microloan movement, says it plans to increase its microlending this year to $66.5 million from $37.8 million in 1990 and $9.8 million five years ago. accion's ms. romanow says the group, which serves latin america, plans to expand the lending to a total of between $500 million and $1 billion over the next five years. trickle up, which makes thousands of $100 loans annually, says its budget rose to $1 million this year from $800,000 in 1989 after doubling almost every year throughout the 1980s. aid has more than doubled its micro-enterprise budget, which includes microlending, training and other activities, to an estimated $114 million this year from $58 million in 1988.
