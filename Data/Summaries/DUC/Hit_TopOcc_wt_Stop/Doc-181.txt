william gray, a professor of atmospheric science at colorado state university, said friday he expects about six atlantic hurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but above average for the decade. the atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the last six hurricane seasons. "it is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season," gray said in a paper presented to the conference. but gray said his models of air pressure, winds around the equator and winds for "el nino" periods, when eastern pacific waters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of when or where a hurricane might form. his prediction of four in 1986 was on the money, and he originally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figure to seven, the eventual correct number, in 1985. drought in west africa is responsible for a drop in atlantic hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, gray said. forecasters and emergency management officials at the conference stressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during the lull in hurricanes a surge in storms, up to the levels of the 1950s and 1960s, could bring unprecedented damage, they said.
