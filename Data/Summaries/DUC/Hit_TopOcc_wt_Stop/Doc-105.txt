a recommended halt to the government's "let it burn" forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the western fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium. the panel, in recommendations thursday to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits to allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn. but it also said that "in some cases the social and economic effects" of allowing a forest fire to burn "may be unacceptable." the panel suggested a temporary halt to the "let it burn" policy, saying the forest service and the national park service needed more time to refine their fire management plans. the report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened. it said actual fire management plans often have not spelled out when natural fires would be allowed to burn and when they would be put out. the agencies involved should make sure that fire management plans conform to departmental policies, that employees understand the policies, that everybody is using a common vocabulary and that agencies have agreed beforehand what to do if fires threaten to move across administrative boundaries, the report said.
