as congress considers the increase, liberal critics on capitol hill are demanding that mr. conable show he is ready to use the bank's vast resources to make some direct impact on reducing the huge burden of third world debt. he has clung to the bank's traditional role of a conventional lender and adviser to developing nations and has deferred on ideas about the debt to the man who picked him for his job -- u.s. treasury secretary james baker. bradley, worried that the debt burden stalls growth and threatens political stability in developing countries, proposes that third world debtors be required to make certain economic reforms in return, their lending banks would forgive some of the loans and write them down on their books. secretary baker says mr. conable is being criticized largely by legislators and academicians who favor grand debt-relief schemes that would take the debt and put it on the backs of the taxpayers. the likelihood is that the bank will need to play a more extensive and diversified role in two areas: new money packages and facilitating other forms of financial relief, including debt-reduction schemes, declares the study, which was drafted by david bock, a vice president and the bank's debt expert. the document even says that for a few debtors, consensual debt relief, including outright forgiveness, might be the only workable solution, but it stresses that the bank must avoid moves that threaten the preservation of the bank's prime standing in financial markets. founded in 1944, it has evolved into a well-paid bureaucracy of 6,000 working in 17 buildings a few blocks from the white house, ignored by tourists but a mandatory stop for finance ministers and bankers visiting washington.
