under the changes, expected to be announced shortly by bush administration officials, all parks would have to run through a safety check list that includes an assessment of weather, moisture, winds and available firefighting crews before they could make a decision on whether or not to let a lightning fire burn. from an ecologist's standpoint, the let-burn policy could be the most serious casualty of last year's blazes, which swelled to historic proportions and ultimately seared nearly 1 million of the park's 2.2 million acres. however, marsha karle, a spokeswoman for the park, said letters and calls logged by yellowstone operators are about double their usual pace and the number of visitors entering the park so far this spring has been well above normal. expect many scientists while the response from tourists is still questionable, the park is bracing for an unprecedented onslaught of scientists looking into everything from fire behavior patterns to its effects on grizzly bears, fisheries, grasslands and the nesting status of bald eagles. yellowstone officials are making no apologies for their handling of the fires, which they contend was not only ecologically sound but also in concert with then existing park service regulations. however, the chairman of the panel, duke university botanist norman l. christensen, told a congressional hearing last january that he considered the fires to be both natural and beneficial to the yellowstone environment. yellowstone fires 1 -- human-caused fires originating outside of yellowstone park 2 -- natural fires originating within yellowstone park 3 -- natural fires originating on adjacent u.s. forest service lands source: yellowstone national park reforestation in yellowstone about 80% of the trees burned in the greater yellowstone park fires were lodgepole pines, a tree that is self-pruning.
