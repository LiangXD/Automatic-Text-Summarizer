confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, de beers consolidated mines ltd., the south african concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving. de beers managed the comeback by convincing diamond producers, dealers and the jewelry industry that its marketing muscle was indispensable. selling diamonds is the business of dealers and jewelers helping them to sell more is ours, says stephen lussier, a de beers marketing executive. the syndicate has purchase contracts with de beers's own mines in south africa and namibia (a territory controlled by south africa), other african states such as botswana, zaire and sierra leone, and australia. de beers has a sales arrangement with the soviets, but moscow has dumped diamonds before and may prove difficult to keep in line. de beers can't stop evolution, says jack lunzer, chairman of idc holdings ltd., a london-based diamond firm that sells diamonds for guinea, an african nation that isn't a cartel member. while sales independence from de beers could be disastrous for the market, mr. lunzer says, that won't deter those producers who want more information and knowledge about final sales of their material.
