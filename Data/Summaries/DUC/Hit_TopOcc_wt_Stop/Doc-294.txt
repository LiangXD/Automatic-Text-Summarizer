at least four moderate earthquakes rattled parts of the world, but there was nary a tremor monday along the new madrid fault, where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to occur. along the new madrid fault, some schools were canceled and residents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town, just in case climatologist iben browning was right. browning said there was a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake early this week along the fault, which stretches from marked tree, ark., northeast through new marid, mo., to cairo, ill. "there's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said person, who has been with the u.s. geological survey for more than 25 years. three were in the south pacific, a 5.9-magnitude shaker near new caledonia, and quakes of 5.1 and 5.0 in the area of tonga. although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, person said. one woman called daily, alerting person that an earthquake was about to occur, based on the number of birds that crossed her windshield as she drove down the street.
