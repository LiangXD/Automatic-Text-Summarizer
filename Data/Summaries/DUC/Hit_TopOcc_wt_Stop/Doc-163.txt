the calm waters of prince william sound have stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in u.s. history, which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid chunks of ice, officials said. coast guard spokesman ed wieliczkiewicz said the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the heavy north slope crude oil failed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up the oil. "this is the largest oil spill in u.s. history and it unfortunately took place in an enclosed water body with numerous islands, channels, bays and fiords," said richard golob, publisher of the golob oil pollution bulletin. the exxon valdez had loaded 1.2 million barrels of oil at the alyeska pipeline service co. marine terminal at valdez and was en route to long beach, calif., when it crunched onto the reef. but the spill likely will draw increasing fire from environmentalists sensitive about the trans-alaska pipeline and efforts to open the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil development. valdez city manager doug griffin said the 800-mile trans-alaska pipeline which carries oil from prudhoe bay to valdez and the marine terminal have an enviable environmental record. the largest tanker spill in history was in the july 19, 1979, collision off tobago of the supertankers atlantic empress and aegean captain, in which 300,000 tons _ more than 80 million gallons _ of oil was lost.
