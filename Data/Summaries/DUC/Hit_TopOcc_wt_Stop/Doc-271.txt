the shining path central committee, comprised of leaders who have still not been arrested and alternate members elected by the shining path congress in 1988, held a meeting in february that was presided over by oscar ramirez durand, a.k.a. this was selected from the document entitled to conquer power in the midst of the people's war that was drafted during the second shining path central committee plenum, when guzman was still free. the second point of the document of the central committee meeting presided over by feliciano highlights the agreements of the working meeting of the shining path leadership held in august 1993, almost one year after guzman was arrested, and during which the implementation of the agreements of the third plenum held in march 1992 was discussed. in order to confront the black group or lod, which are nothing but shining path militants who sign abimael guzman's letters and uphold his great decision and definition to negotiate with the government in order to end the war, the central committee demands that the militants grow stronger on the basis for partisan unity [base de unidad partidaria, bup], which is the shining path basic principles adopted during the 1988 congress, and arrange for conquering power in the midst of the people's war. 2. abimael guzman's letters to president alberto fujimori, the telephone conversation between guzman and javier esparza marquez (guzman's brother-in-law, who is in charge of shining path's organization abroad), and the communiques released by shining path prisoners are a counterrevolutionary scheme concocted by yankee imperialists and the genocidal and traitorous dictatorship with the sinister help of the black group, the central committee concluded at its february meeting. the central committee does acknowledge guzman as its leader, and gives him credit for the ideology he devised, the so-called gonzalo's thoughts, but now he is considered to be a merely decorative figure because neither the party nor the war can be led from a cell, especially when the leader is kept incommunicado and his contacts with the outside world must go through government officials. meanwhile, the central committee has acknowledged gonzalo's thoughts as the ideological basis for the people's war, guzman reinoso's leadership and his inability to lead the party and the war from prison, and has decided to reorganize the shining path machine to launch a new stage of the war without guzman.
