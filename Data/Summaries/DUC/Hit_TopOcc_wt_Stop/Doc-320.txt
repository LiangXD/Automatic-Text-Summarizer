in each case, the former junk bond impresario will be viewed as a convicted felon. -- so much evidence against him has already been gathered by federal prosecutors and the securities and exchange commission, much of which will eventually become available to shareholder lawyers, that plaintiffs' attorneys will have to do relatively little sleuthing of their own. -- while mr. milken didn't plead guilty to any racketeering counts, recent court cases have made it increasingly easy to show a so-called pattern of racketeering in civil cases. also pending are a multitude of civil cases lodged in the past three years against mr. boesky, drexel, mr. milken and others that accuse the defendants of insider trading, stock manipulation and other securities law violations. many of these cases are pending in federal court in new york, where pretrial fact-finding has been slowed because of the unavailability of mr. boesky, mr. milken and others to testify at depositions. finally, a sprinkling of cases across the country target mr. milken among many other defendants in cases alleging that savings and loans associations and other companies suffered losses because they purchased large portfolios of drexel's junk bonds as part of back-scratching arrangements with mr. milken. alan bromberg, a law professor at southern methodist university, says showing a chain of bond purchases doesn't necessarily prove that mr. milken was in control of the sellers and buyers, but it does permit that inference. mr. bromberg and others assert that mr. liman, mr. milken's principal lawyer, negotiated to make the plea agreement narrow enough so that little of what mr. milken admitted to can be used against him in the civil suits. realistically, it's highly unlikely that the civil cases against mr. milken will ever go to trial.
