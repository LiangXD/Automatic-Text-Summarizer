it has been two years since johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the seoul olympics. big money promoters of indoor meets this season doubt that johnson will regain his records, but they hope that fans will turn out in huge numbers to watch him try. indeed, in a season that holds the promise of high performance levels in general (as athletes peak for the world indoor championships in seville, spain, in march), johnson's return to competition might help rejuvenate a sport in need of public interest. if he's eligible to compete, to me, ben johnson is an attraction, said ray lumpp, meet director for the indoor meet at the meadowlands in east rutherford, n.j.. johnson reportedly will be paid $10,000 (canadian) for the meet in hamilton, a figure that has caused some jealousy among his peers. hamilton promoter gaines has heard it before, and makes no apology for paying johnson more than other athletes. the iaaf voted last september to adopt the controversial ben johnson rule allowing the iaaf council to decertify an athlete's records, titles and results if he or she later is shown to have used a banned substance before those performances.
