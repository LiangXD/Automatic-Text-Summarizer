the stripping of ben johnson's olympic gold medal in a drug scandal has wounded canadian pride and shamed a nation hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar wayne gretzky. johnson's disgrace was heralded in canadian headlines such as "fool's gold," "black day for canada," "seconds of glory, years of shame," "from fame to shame," and "big ben is now has-ben." some of us don't want to accept what happened," said john furedy, a psychologist at the university of toronto, in assessing the mational psyche. trent frayne, sports columnist for the globe and mail of toronto, said johnson's victory was the biggest event in canada since a national team beat the soviet union in a seven-game hockey series in 1972. "it's as if an entire country has gone into a period of national mourning on his behalf," wrote columnist john robertson of the toronto star. canada has always tried to escape the influence of the united states, where its dollar is worth 80 cents. but columnist gary lautens of the toronto star said the nation should not cover its head in shame.
