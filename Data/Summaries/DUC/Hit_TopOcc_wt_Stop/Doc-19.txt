the fbi has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the man who was arrested -- don jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the hawthorne police department -- were violated during his altercation with two long beach officers on pacific coast highway, spokesman fred reagan said. the two men said they wanted to demonstrate a long-standing problem of abuse of minority group members by long beach police officers. although long beach mayor ernie kell told nbc's today show on tuesday morning that the two police officers had been suspended, police chief lawrence l. binkley said that the officers, mark dickey and mark ramsey, will remain on duty at this stage of the investigation. kell admitted later tuesday that he was in error in his today show comments, but said he would favor firing the officers if it is proved that they used brutal tactics in dealing with jackson. the group also complained that dickey also used a string of obscenities in his conversation with jackson, who was booked for suspicion of using offensive language, challenging an officer to fight and obstructing arrest. concedes error by officer attorney hannon conceded that dickey was wrong to spice his orders to jackson with obscenities, but he said the cursing was evidence of discourtesy, rather than racism. although the two men in the car were black, driving an old car and dressed in shabby clothes, they were not stopped for those reasons, the lawyer said, adding that they were in a section of the city where their appearance was not unusual.
