When Drexel settled a massive SEC lawsuit, the firm agreed not to do business "directly or indirectly" with Milken.It's not clear, for example, whether legal problems would arise if a company hired Drexel to underwrite securities according to a recapitalization plan drawn up by Milken.Since leaving Drexel, Milken has had talks with many of his old firm's clients, according to a senior Drexel executive.And in a long interview in ICAG's offices, Milken confirmed that a significant part of ICAG's business will be with ordinary companies.In an off-the-record interview, the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively said that he couldn't afford to have any formal business relationship with ICAG.He says Puck's company at the time was in financial difficulties and needed a lot of financing.When Drexel's former junk bond chief announced plans for the firm, he said it would help members of minority groups and unions raise the capital to own companies."What we're doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at Drexel)," in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital, Milken says, although he no longer trades or underwrites securities.Officials at the new firm say they are aren't making overtures to lure Drexel employees to ICAG.Investment banking sources say that Milken, in effect, also is closed out of doing work for the gambling industry, which made up a big share of his clients at Drexel.But Milken maintains that he is simply doing what he has always done, advising companies to profit from market conditions.Milken, who was one of the most feared competitors on Wall Street when he was at Drexel, now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and underwriting business that he can no longer do himself.And it is working on finding new capital for successful companies and refinancing firms that are in trouble.In exchange for Milken's brainpower and contacts in arranging refinancing, ICAG expects to receive an ownership stake in most of the companies that it helps.Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, says the firm hasn't lost any clients to ICAG.Such activities were a main part of Milken's activities at Drexel.Only the firm's name, not Milken's, is on the door.Asked if it bothers him that he can no longer issue new securities, Milken says, "it's not something I'm thinking about at this time."He said the commercial banks with which his company does business have indicated that they might stop lending to him if he does.ICAG cannot trade or underwrite securities.But the new firm is also gearing up for a considerable amount of potentially more profitable business.After a speech he made in September, Milken was widely quoted as suggesting that companies should now attempt to reduce their level of high-yield debt.He refuses to discuss ICAG's fees or even confirm that he expects the company to be profitable.But one clue to the amount of money that Milken personally is committing to the firm is how much he says ICAG is willing to invest in an individual transaction.At Drexel, Milken essentially created the market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, and he revolutionized the way that capital was raised for medium-sized U.S. companies.Milken won't comment on the terms on which ICAG is helping these companies, but one deal that fell through suggests that, while his aim may be to help others, he isn't neglecting his own interests.Milken's new company, International Capital Access Group, is open for business.Milken says ICAG plans to do this for other employee-owned companies as well, since many of them have trouble raising the money to buy equipment outright.Despite the racketeering and securities fraud indictment hanging over him and his forced resignation from Drexel in June, Milken hasn't retreated to the sidelines.Milken says his firm expects to help salvage some of the large companies that have been in the news in the last couple of months because of severe difficulties in meeting the payments on their junk debt.
