Claiming that a more competitive Mexico, with free access to the US and Canada, will capture markets which Caribbean basin countries have developed under current trade agreements, the region has asked for 'parity' with Mexico in exporting to Nafta signatories.The parity proposals are aimed at giving Caribbean basin countries an open door to the Nafta market for three years.'The Nafta playing field will never be level for the region,' he said.Without improved access to the US and Canadian markets to counter Mexico's benefits under Nafta, the Caribbean basin countries will have to continue depending on their current trade preference agreements with the US and Canada.'In the past 10 years US exports to the Caribbean basin have doubled, making the region the tenth largest market for US exporters.In presenting their case for parity, Caribbean leaders have argued that the US and Canada will also be the losers if there is extensive economic dislocation in the region caused by a loss of markets to Mexico.
