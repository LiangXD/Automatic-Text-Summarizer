"It's a beautiful thing," Fujita said.He also developed the Fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes."Tornadoes are very rare in Japan," Fujita said."In Texas one time, five people were killed when they drove right into a tornado.Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, but are more dangerous because they give pilots less time to react, Fujita said.Fujita retires from teaching this year, but will continue his research at the university.Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research.But Fujita considers his work on other air movements called downbursts and microbursts among his most significant achievements.Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado.Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953, partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country.Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982.They just didn't know any better," Fujita said.When he saw his first tornado, he and a team of scientists were studying wind shear and its effect on aircraft.
