Las Vegas is one of only 15 U.S. cities that can provide the hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention, said Alvin C. Shackleford, a convention spokesman.In addition to bringing in up to $15 million in revenue, the Southern Baptist convention should help the city's image, Powers said.Las Vegas, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and swingers in recent years, is ready for the Southern Baptists.A series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign Saturday in which about 2,000 Southern Baptists were expected knock on doors around Las Vegas.Six years after the denomination voted to meet in Las Vegas, the decision still evokes controversy, and many Southern Baptists have decided to stay home.
