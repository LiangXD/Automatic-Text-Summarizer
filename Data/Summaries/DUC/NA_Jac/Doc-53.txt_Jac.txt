This suggests that the Democrats aren't as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the American public are.With the ball in its court, Congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors, or it can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor.If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is.In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years.Many of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform.The Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy.
