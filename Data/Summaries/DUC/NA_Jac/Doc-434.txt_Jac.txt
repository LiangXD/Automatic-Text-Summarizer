Ira Reiner, whose office has flip-flopped twice in its bail recommendations in the case, praised the decision not to reduce Keating's bail.While defense attorneys wouldn't say what they thought of the prosecutor's actions, other lawyers connected indirectly to the case scored Reiner for allegedly using the case and his changing views on Keating's bail to bolster his public image.At the same time, Klausner reduced bail for three Keating co-defendants from the $1 million he imposed Tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the former operators of American Continental Corp. and its former main subsidiary, Lincoln.After Klausner first ruled, Reiner said he then supported the bail set.Klausner also said he was "troubled" by the way the district attorney has equivocated on the bail issue.Afterwards, Donald Smaltz, attorney for Symes, criticized Reiner and Klausner for their handling of the bail hearing.Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, indicated he would appeal Klausner's ruling.Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner said Keating -- pursued by creditors, regulators and prosecutors for his role in the failure of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan -- has "significant reasons not to stay around."Klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper bail, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing were the most important in this case."Mr. Keating is accused of cheating people out of their savings," Reiner said in a press conference after the hearing.Bail is supposed to assure a defendant's appearance in court and must be within the means he could reasonably afford."He said 17,458 small investors had bought $250 million in American Continental bonds at Lincoln.The judge's decision came after 1 1/2 days of testimony and arguments in the first criminal case to be filed in connection with the collapses of Lincoln and Phoenix-based American Continental.Bail for Judy J. Wischer, 42, former American Continental president, was lowered to $200,000.Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to investigate Lincoln, said he was willing to let the defendants go without bail on Tuesday because he didn't want to face a difficult battle extraditing Keating from Arizona.Reiner said that, though his office had no evidence that Keating would flee, "you can't escape the thought of Mr. Robert Vesco in a case like this."Paul W. Turley argued against reducing the bail.
