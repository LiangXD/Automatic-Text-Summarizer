There are hundreds of beaches all over the sound that are still oiled, and the oil is slowly bleeding out.From a helicopter, the wave-washed beach looks as if the worst oil spill in U.S. history had never touched it.But when Exxon suspended its $2 billion cleanup in mid-September, it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the oil spilled, state officials estimate.That leaves 50 percent to 75 percent of the oil in the water, on the ocean bottom or on beaches.They say observers flying over the sound still report 15 to 20 oil sheens bleeding off beaches daily.A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, the question clings like the oil under this Perry Island beach."We never claimed that the spill put any animal on the endangered species list, but that's missing the point," said Fish and Wildlife spokesman Bruce Batten.Exxon notes the spill did not wipe out any species and says surviving animals and birds will rebuild populations."Hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under this beach," he says.
