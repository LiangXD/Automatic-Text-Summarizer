"Britain becomes branch line of Europe," a Guardian newspaper headline declared after the government announced June 14 that it would not fund a high-speed rail link between London and the British end of the tunnel.Giant boring machines are digging three tunnels toward each other from Folkestone, England and Calais, France, with the first underground meeting expected in November in the service tunnel between the rail tunnels.Eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent of Britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the first year.Eurotunnel Chairman Andre Benard said the company has provided for any foreseeable problems, but stressed: "We always made it very clear that this was a risk project.""We will have the money to finish the project," says Alastair Morton, British deputy chairman of Eurotunnel, the privately owned Anglo-French company overseeing the work.While the French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link to their end of the tunnel, for example, state-owned British Rail is dragging.It's been described as the largest current civil engineering project, a multibillion dollar link that will help revolutionize Europe's economy and physically end Britain's historic isolation, a dream born in Napoleon's day.The "Chunnel" between Britain and France is half-dug and scheduled to open on time in three years.In October, concern about the rising pricetag drove Eurotunnel's banking syndicate to freeze funds for three months until the company reached a truce with Trans-Manche Link, the consortium of 10 British and French contractors doing the construction, over responsibility for $1.7 billion in overruns.
