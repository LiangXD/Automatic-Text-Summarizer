In choosing federal Judge Robert Bork for the Supreme Court, President Reagan has tapped a leading architect of conservative legal theory -- and has ensured a tough confirmation battle in the Senate.Judge Bork has been widely and sharply critical of the Supreme Court's 1964 decision establishing the principle of "one person, one vote."Judge Bork returned to Yale from 1977 to 1981 when he practiced law for a year before he was nominated for the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C."Unless Judge Bork can demonstrate to me that he comes to the court with an open mind, I would have some difficulty," said Sen.It was that 1965 ruling that was the basis for the Supreme Court's 1973 decision recognizing a woman's right to an abortion, and Judge Bork's criticism of sexual privacy has caused alarm among women's groups over his nomination.Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a Judiciary Committee member, lost no time urging that Judge Bork should be defeated.Committee Democrats say they don't expect to start hearings until September, raising questions about whether Judge Bork would be approved by the Supreme Court's opening next Oct.He is a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist used to stay with Judge Bork on visits to Yale.Views he expressed in 1971 in a series of lectures at Indiana University Law School argued that the First Amendment protects only speech expressly about government and politics.And liberal Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, fearful that Mr. Reagan's choice may upset the Supreme Court's moderate balance, have made clear they will fight any candidate whose views about the Constitution and the courts are too conservative.The only questions were whether to go with a younger conservative whose influence would last well into the next century and whether the strength of Judge Bork's conservative views would make his confirmation too difficult.The president's nominee to become the 104th justice is a bear of a man.The selection of the 60-year-old Judge Bork to replace retiring Justice Lewis Powell gives the president his third Supreme Court appointment and by far his greatest opportunity to alter the court's direction.But in Judge Bork, appointed by Mr. Reagan in 1982 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the president has picked a rare judicial -- rather than a political -- conservative, a judge committed to a narrow role for the courts rather than to the Reagan administration's political agenda.But it is Judge Bork's prolific and forceful writings as a law professor and judge that have earned him his reputation as an intellectual leader of conservative legal thought for a generation of law school graduates."He is a true judicial conservative," says Dennis Hutchinson, a University of Chicago law professor, "and that means judges are supposed to defer to the decisions of the legislature."But the expectation, even among some Democrats, is that Judge Bork will be approved.In 1973, President Nixon tapped him to be solicitor general, the Justice Department official who represents the executive branch before the Supreme Court."He stands for an extremist view of the Constitution and the role of the Supreme Court," Sen.Once a New Deal liberal, Judge Bork became more conservative while at the University of Chicago.Kennedy yesterday suggested that the "Saturday Night Massacre" will be an issue, saying the president "should not be able to reach out of the muck of Irangate {and} reach into the muck of Watergate" for a Supreme Court nominee.And the AFL-CIO urged senators to refrain from endorsing Judge Bork until they can carefully review his record."Judge Bork, widely regarded as the most prominent and intellectually powerful advocate of judicial restraint, shares my views that judges' personal preferences and values should not be part of their constitutional interpretations," Mr. Reagan said.
