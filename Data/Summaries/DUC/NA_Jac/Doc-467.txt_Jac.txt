The death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among non-smokers, according to a study published Friday.For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death from lymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher, and for one to 10 cigarettes, 40 percent higher."If the findings in our study represented a direct relationship between smoking and leukemia, then it must follow that smoking is responsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hitherto established causes combined," said Dr. Leo Kinlen, director of the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Edinburgh.
