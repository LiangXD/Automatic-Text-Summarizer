Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six Western states, and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long-handled nets.The storms dampened a fire in Bridger-Teton National Forest that had burned nearly 3,500 acres.Officials said 566 Gila trout were fished out of Diamond Creek in southwestern New Mexico, put in containers on mules and horses, loaded onto trucks and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery.The blaze blackened acres of ponderosa pine trees, many of them 60 to 80 years old, said U.S. Forest Service Fire Staff Officer Jim Carson.Lightning sparked three small fires Thursday and today, but firefighters were extinguishing them today, said Willie Zapata, U.S. Forest Service dispatcher in Gila.Arizona firefighters mopped up hot spots in several small fires, and only one blaze in the state was not fully contained.But one official with the Wyoming Interagency Fire Coordination Center warned the break in the fire season will probably be short-lived.
