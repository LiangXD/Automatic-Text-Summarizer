I'm here today to explain to the people of Iraq why the United States and the world community has responded the way it has to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.I do not believe that you, the people of Iraq, want war.The United Nations has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish the Iraqi people, but as a peaceful means to convince your leadership to withdraw from Kuwait.But even worse, others are being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.Ultimately, Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait.Saddam Hussein tells you the occupation of Kuwait will benefit the poorer nations of the world.Iraq must get out of Kuwait -- for the sake of principle, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the Iraqi people.When we stand with Kuwait against aggression, we stand for a principle well understood in the Arab world.No one knows what Iraq might be today, what prosperity and peace you might enjoy had your leaders not plunged you into war.Because of Iraq's aggression, hundreds of thousands of innocent foreign workers are fleeing Kuwait and Iraq.I do not want to add to the suffering of the people of Iraq.Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and America.No one -- not the American people, not this President -- wants war.2, your leadership made its decision to invade, an unprovoked attack on a small nation that posed no threat to your own.In fact, the occupation of Kuwait is helping no one and is now hurting you, the Iraqi people, and countless others of the world's poor.Let me say clearly, there is no way Iraq can win.We have no quarrel with the people of Iraq.
