"We want the world to know much, much more about Antarctica after our expedition than it did before we set out," Steger said.The USSR also plans to send a military cargo plane to pick up the team from its rendezvous at Steger's Minnesota camp; the U.S. State Department, while not officially sanctioning the trek, is expected to let the plane land.Qin will take snow and ice samples all the way across Antarctica, recording temperatures and oxygen content for a geological history of the icecap.These ominous changes are most apparent in Antarctica, making it "like a canary in a mine," Steger said.The other environmental nightmare awakening interest in Antarctica is the discovery of a giant hole in the ozone layer directly over the continent.The team will carry a monitor and Boyarsky will record ozone levels at regular intervals, the first cross-section of ozone across the continent.Steger, who in the past has picked his own teams, says he is honored that the Soviet Union and China will be sending official representatives.Antarctica's 5.4 million square miles is more than China and India combined.This one would do that and more: draw attention to threats against nature and to the need for international cooperation in protecting Antarctica.Steger and Etienne enlisted scientists and explorers from the Soviet Union, China, Japan and Great Britain for a seven-month, 4,000-mile trip.The team will be under the ozone hole for about 40 days and 500 miles as they cross a 13,000-foot high plateau known as the Area of Inaccessibility.Vostok, the coldest place on Earth, will serve as a base for a French documentary film crew that will travel with the expedition for three weeks, and for the team's pilot.
