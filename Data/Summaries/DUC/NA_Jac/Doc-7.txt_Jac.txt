The kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease since it appeared in cows.The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.Sheep are believed to catch the disease by contact with placentas in fields after births, but in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely.If it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu were simply more susceptible to the disease.
