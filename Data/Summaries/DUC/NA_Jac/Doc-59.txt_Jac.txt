Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support.Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these.And the demands put on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private provision of pensions and healthcare.Continuing rises in the base level of unemployment would further undermine countries' ability to pay for their welfare states.An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in borrowing to fund the welfare state.Increases in life expectancy have already increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions.Moves are afoot in countries such as Germany and Italy to raise the pension age.The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions.The strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by relating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age.The ageing of the population has also contributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions.In a global economy, no country can long afford to burden business with higher welfare costs than its neighbours.Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes.Tackling these longer-term pressures will require more than tinkering with charges and efficiency drives in welfare services.Measures such as these would fundamentally change the nature of the welfare state, however.Lone-parent families now typically constitute 10-15 per cent of of all families with children in OECD countries.Added to concerns over demography and social change are fears over the increase in unemployment levels across the OECD.The OECD's immediate priorities for reform include charges for the use of some welfare services and greater competition to increase the efficiency of those services.In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.
