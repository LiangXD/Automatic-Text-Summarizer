18, when Oklahoma voters endorsed overwhelmingly a ballot initiative limiting state lawmakers to 12 years' service.By itself, the term limitation in Oklahoma might be written off as a cranky act of vengeance in a state not renowned as a political trend-setter, but similar measures will be voted on in November in California and Colorado.The quack therapy being performed on them is the imposition of limits on the number of terms that state lawmakers can serve.Where state legislators are underpaid, have no professional staffs and meet rarely, they usually come under the sway of full-time governors, executive-branch bureaucrats and highly paid lobbyists.The first President to come under the restriction was Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican who might very well have won a third term.Ultimately, what the term limit amounts to is an indictment of citizenship.Not every state lawmaker has his eye on a seat in the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives.Eager for straws in the wind in an otherwise trendless political year, some journalists have seen in the Oklahoma vote a backlash against incumbents, a manifestation of public alienation and an ominous sign to the Democrats, the party that holds the largest number of legislative seats.
