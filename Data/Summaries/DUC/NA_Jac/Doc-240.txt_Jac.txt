In Portsmouth, Virginia, one of the last undecided congressmen, Owen Pickett, is in his district office, as he is every weekend.The organisers said they were sending a message to Virginia's three wavering congressmen that a 'yes' vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be 'remembered in November'.As a member of the House armed services committee he expects the foreign policy implications of the Nafta vote to weigh heavily in his decision.IN VIRGINIA the North American Free Trade Agreement evokes a passionate opposition, but football, apparently, still is the reigning obsession.His door bears a sign, 'This office belongs to the people of the second district of Virginia'.Virginia has 11 congressmen.'In Virginia there was slavery, but the slaves were expensive and the people who owned them valued them.A 'not this Nafta' rally on Saturday provided little competition for the college 'game of the century' - Florida State University against Notre Dame.Mexican workers are treated like slaves, he claims.
