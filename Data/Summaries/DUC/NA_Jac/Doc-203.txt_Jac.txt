Eurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable without the high-speed rail link.But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits."If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links.Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services.As a result of Thursday's decision, the journey time to London from Paris will be about three hours -- 30 minutes longer than with a high-speed rail link."We make more money on road traffic using our tunnel," Mr. Morton says.He said British Rail, which owns 50% of the consortium, would consider other options for a fast-rail link.
