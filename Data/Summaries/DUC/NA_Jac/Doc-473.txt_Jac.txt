Worst news of all, Labor Secretary William Brock appears ready to compromise away President Reagan's soundly based opposition to the minimum wage.Some of those new jobs wouldn't be there if Congress had continued to dictate a minimum level of wages.At any rate, a study commission appointed by Jimmy Carter estimated in a 1981 report that every 10% increase in the minimum wage cost the economy 80,000 to 200,000 entry-level jobs.Secretary Brock has said he won't concede on anything in the Kennedy package that will create job loss.Yet organized labor, which constantly asserts its interest in job creation, has made a strong pitch for the Kennedy-Hawkins "Minimum Wage Restoration Act," a bill that would head the minimum wage upward once more.Since Congress stopped raising the federal minimum wage in 1981, the U.S. economy has generated nine million new jobs at all salary levels.
