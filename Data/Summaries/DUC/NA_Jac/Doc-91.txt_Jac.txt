"Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens," added Rep.Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens benefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra seats in the House.Ridge cited the 1980 census, which estimated the number of illegal aliens at 2 million.The Census Bureau also opposes the bills, contending that the effort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay and complicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell the truth anyway.
