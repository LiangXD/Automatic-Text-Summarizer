Canadians were shamed, angry and saddened Tuesday that national hero Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal for using drugs to enhance his performance.Sports Minister Jean Charest, who called the incident "a national embarrassment," said Johnson will be banned from Canada's national team for life."Everybody knew in advance that Mr. Johnson, if he wins a medal, was going to be tested," said Charest."From time to time people would come to me in a private way _ and this happened one or two times ... that maybe Ben Johnson is using steroids or other drugs," he said.Canadian speedskater Gaetan Boucher judged the sprinter harshly, saying he has "no respect" for an athlete who takes drugs."If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again _ my brother is not on drugs."
