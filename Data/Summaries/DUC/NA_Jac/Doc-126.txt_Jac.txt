-- More than 90% of police chiefs and sheriffs surveyed agree that criminals are not affected by a ban on any type of firearm, while more than 70% oppose "waiting periods" for the same reason. -- A prisoner survey conducted by James D. Wright et al. found that unarmed felons listed tougher penalties for using a gun as an important reason for not arming themselves. -- 75%-80% of U.S. violent crimes are committed by career criminals, many on some form of conditional or early release (30%-35% of career criminals are rearrested with previous criminal charges still pending). -- Gary Kleck found that using a gun for protection from violent crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- reduces the likelihood that the crime will be completed and that intended victims will be injured.Mr. Gartner ignores the key issues regarding suicide and crime.As evidenced by New York City and Washington, which have the nation's strictest gun-control laws and virtually ban the ownership of handguns by law-abiding citizens, Mr. Gartner's placebo doesn't work because it ignores the root causes of suicide and crime.According to Mr. Gartner, "this year about 3,000 teen-agers . . . will use handguns to kill themselves.Thus the "well-organized militia" phrase in the Second Amendment was not intended to restrict arms to those in the militia -- as the anti-gun lobby would have us believe.Clearly, the issue at hand is not gun control but, rather, crime control.
