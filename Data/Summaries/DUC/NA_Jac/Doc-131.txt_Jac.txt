It also was the first time Kristiansen had beaten Samuelson in a marathon.It had been at least eight years since Samuelson was beaten in the marathon by an American.In an emotional news conference afterward, Samuelson, who won the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984 at Los Angeles, tearfully conceded that she might have run her last marathon for some time.Samuelson, who holds the U.S. marathon record, said she will significantly decrease her training mileage and probably run shorter races.Samuelson held on to second place and even ran comfortably until about 11 miles, when she came undone.THEY'VE GOT A LOCK ON THE MARATHON How Ethiopia's marathoners have fared the last two days:John Treacy of Ireland, who was third behind Ikangaa here last year, was third again in 2:10:24.And they ran not as strangers, because Mekonnen had beaten Ikangaa in winning last year's Tokyo Marathon.Kristiansen, the women's marathon world record-holder, started fast but slowed markedly on a hot day."I knew that I should stay with him until the last (two miles).Joan Benoit Samuelson, who set a world record on this course in 1983, was beset with physical problems that altered her stride at 11 miles, and she finished ninth among the women in 2:37:52.It was the first time since 1963 that an Ethiopian had run at Boston and Mekonnen, 24, made the most of it.For the first few miles, before the heat, Kristiansen was running at a 2:17 pace.In two days, Ethiopian runners have won three major marathons."I was prepared for hot weather and it certainly was hot, but the heat wasn't my problem today," Samuelson said."I've run some very good races and I think I have some very good races left in me," she said.Also on Sunday, in the World Cup Marathon at Milan, Ethiopians finished 1-2."Before I came to Boston, I had a lot of problems with my hip and my back.Or at least since the last time Ethiopia ventured from its athletic isolation and won three consecutive Olympic gold medals, putting its indelible stamp on the marathon.Ethiopia also took the marathon gold in 1968, when Mamo Wolde, 36, won at altitude in Mexico City.The pace got the best of Saimon Robert Haali of Tanzania, who led the race for five miles.Lisa Weidenbach went flying by me at that point.He was among the pack of four African runners that led the 6,418 entrants race for 15 miles.(But) I have been spending as much time in physical therapy as I have in training and I can't continue that.Nearly a dozen Ethiopian runners have been deployed around the world in this hectic two-week period of spring marathons.Dinsamo holds the world record of 2:06:50, set last year on the same course.
