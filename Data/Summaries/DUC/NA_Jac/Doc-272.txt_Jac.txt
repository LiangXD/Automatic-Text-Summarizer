In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won.The polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way they can control Congress effectively is by limiting terms.The opinion polls for term limitation show that the voters don't like the change.In the current House it is 8%.Senators have become just as brazen as their House brethren in shutting out competition.Michael Kinsley writes in the New Republic that if incumbents always win, it's because voters can't be bothered.
