Sitting in his office at the American Enterprise Institute, his back to his word processor, he briefly considers what might have been: "I don't want to spend the rest of my life reliving it."I think this book has the chance to have more impact.Bork, who abhored grading papers when he taught, says with a self-satisfied grin, "It's a very good faculty, with no blue books."The first time around when I was nominated for the Court of Appeals, the Senate approved me unanimously, as did the committee."He recalls the impact of a book he wrote a dozen years ago on antitrust law."Not mine," says Bork.Bork has plans for perhaps two more books, one in more academic detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools, and another on the relationship of law and the culture.Bork enjoys the atmosphere at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank that has become his small university.He says he is taking his case to a higher court, the American public and the next generation.The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate is quick to smile at the irony the last two years have brought.
