The remaining 14 states and the District of Columbia have laws banning polygraph examinations for employment purposes, and these laws take precedence over the new federal statute if they are more restrictive, according to Goldberg."We expect that the new law will ban 80 percent of the approximately 2 million polygraph tests given annually," Goldberg said in a prepared statement.The law prohibits an employee from being fired, disciplined or discriminated against solely for refusing to submit to a polygraph examination.
