Shaken, thousands of people are crowding into earthquake survival classes.That will kill more people than earthquakes."Robert Edwards, a Blytheville fireman who teaches seminars in earthquake survival, has become a hot property.Plenty of other business people are cashing in on his prediction.The New Madrid (pronounced MAD-rid) fault still has 150 small, mostly unfelt, earthquakes a year.Iben Browning, a 72-year-old scientist, predicted October's Bay Area quake a week before it happened, say people who heard him speak to the Equipment Manufacturers Institute."No responsible scientist can predict an exact day for an earthquake," says Brian Mitchell, a quake expert at St. Louis University, echoing the majority opinion.So many people plan to skip town on Dec.Since 1971, Mr. Browning says, he has picked the correct dates of four large earthquakes, two volcanoes -- and one day with both a volcano and an earthquake.The New Madrid area has a 50-50 chance of producing at least a 7 quake on Dec.Trying to calm the fear, the National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, a panel of academic and government seismic experts, will review the Browning claim at a meeting in a few weeks.Over the years, a few pinpoint-on-the map towns have tried to capitalize on the little-known fault.They were more than 10 times greater than the 7.1 quake that rocked California's Bay Area last October."We're overdue for one in the 6s and low 7s," says David Stewart, an earthquake expert at Southeast Missouri State University.In Missouri and Arkansas, some schools and businesses have announced plans to close in early December.At that time, a similar quake has a lesser chance of occurring on California's San Andreas or Hayward faults, according to Mr. Browning, and an 8.2 quake in Tokyo has a greater chance.
