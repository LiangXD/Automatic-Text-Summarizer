Since Mr. Bush has just succeeded in turning the U.N. into a useful instrument for enhancing world order, he can't let Saddam Hussein steal his success.The U.S. is committed to support the U.N., and the U.N. is now committed to inserting itself deeply into the internal affairs of Iraq.Saddam Hussein may not realize it, but as he begins to obstruct, violate and sabotage the U.N. implementation of the ceasefire agreement, he must take on not just some bureaucrats at U.N. headquarters and the U.N. flag.It is most implausible that Saddam Hussein could survive as Iraq's dictator and comply with these terms.If international security guarantees were to fail in this instance, the deal that could be offered to Israel would no longer be "territory for peace," but territory for a worthless U.N. document.Moreover, the president will depend on the U.N.Between the invasion of Kuwait last August and the end of the Gulf war, many brave souls inside and outside the U.S. government worried about clever stratagems that Saddam Hussein might employ to defeat the U.S.For this to be true, Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to slam the window shut.
