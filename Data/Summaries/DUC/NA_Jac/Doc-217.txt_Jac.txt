"Obviously, firefighting on the line is stressful," said Fire Center spokesman Arnold Hartigan."Fortunately we don't work at this level all year," Hartigan said.They fill up again and again with thousands of gallons of "slurry," a fertilizer-based substance that stops fires cold.Hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the Idaho backcountry for days after the last "lightning bust."Flames swept over thousands of acres in several hours' time, creating a smoky miasma around Idaho's capital city.It will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the nation's fires.Until then, the lights will be on at the Fire Center, and the pace will be frenetic."We drop slimy red mud on burning trees from antique airplanes," declares the slogan on one T-shirt.
