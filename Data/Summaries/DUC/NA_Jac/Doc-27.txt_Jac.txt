It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year."We are defending the officers being in that apartment," Mills said.In June, several white officers bloodied a Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the ground.Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar and whether he would have lunged at the officer.Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said.The officer who shot Barnes was a two-year veteran of the force.Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong.
