Mr Kraai van Niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on continued political reform in South Africa, and Prieska is the centre of his constituency.Mr van Niekerk concedes that such suggestions contain an element of truth But the drought is also an established fact and there are socio-economic as well as agricultural reasons why as many farmers as possible should be saved.It appears likely, therefore, that it will be necessary for South Africa to import up to 5m tonnes of maize during the coming months.They know him well; for not only is he a neighbouring farmer (his farm is just 170 km away by dirt road and that qualifies as 'neighbour' in this vast hot countryside) but he is also South Africa's minister of agriculture.But in the meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow.But back in the Orange Free State, last week, farmers were worrying about the continued absence of any rain to provide moisture to germinate wheat seeds when they were due to be planted in a few weeks time.LAST FRIDAY was the day of the annual agricultural show at Prieska in the northern part of South Africa's Cape Province.It is, in fact, the arable farmers further east who are suffering most, as I had seen and heard for myself a few days earlier, and Mr van Niekerk has already set up committees of bankers, extension officers and local farmers' representatives, to try to find ways to avoid many of them going bankrupt.
