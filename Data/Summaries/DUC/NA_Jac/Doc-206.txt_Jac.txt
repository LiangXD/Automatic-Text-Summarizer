Management sources at TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the "Chunnel" - the Channel Tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when British workers sent the probe through to French colleagues.Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported."This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island," said a construction union official.Officials estimate the tunnel may carry 28 million passengers in the first year of operation, although Eurotunnel doesn't expect a profit until the end of the century.French workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their British counterparts and relayed the news to TransManche officials.It's the first time we have air passing between the two tunnels," said Gordon Crighton, tunnel engineering manager.The Chunnel actually consists of three tunnels - two for railway trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between them.The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting for its total length of 31 miles.The first coupling of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.
