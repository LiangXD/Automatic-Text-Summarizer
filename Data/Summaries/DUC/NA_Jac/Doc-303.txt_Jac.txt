I'm Clarence Thomas."; SUNDAY IN PERSPECTIVE: A reporter who saw Clarence Thomas at his most candid writes about the nominee's opinions, fears and frustrations.; Nomination Of Clarence Thomas; President Bush has chosen Judge Clarence Thomas of the U.S. Court of Appeals to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall, who is retiring from the Supreme Court.; Nominee's background; Age: 43; Birthplace: Savannah, Ga.; Family: Married to Virginia Lamp Thomas; he has one son, Jamal; Education: Bachelor's degree, 1971, Holy Cross College; law degree, Yale Law School, 1974; Professional experience: Missouri assistant attorney general, 1974-'77; chairman of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 1982-'89; judge on U.S. Court of Appeals for District of Columbia since.He saw how our family and other people struggled to make a living.; "I guess Clarence wanted to prove to himself he could be what he wanted to be -- and prove to his grandfather he could be the kind of person (his grandfather) wanted him to be."; The grandfather, the late Myers Anderson, began training Thomas in earnest when the boy was 9 and Leola Williams' life suddenly began coming apart."; When Anderson wasn't coaching Thomas, in his farm fields or on his delivery truck, he made sure the lessons continued, in the hands of the Franciscan nuns of all-black St. Benedict the Moor School.; Thomas, who had experienced racial mistreatment by white seminarians in Georgia, ultimately rejected seminary life.He graduated from Holy Cross with honors and left for Yale University Law School in New Haven, Conn.; Freewheeling liberalism; "He came into law school espousing liberal views from his freewheeling, unattached undergraduate days," said Harry Singleton, a black classmate, close friend and a former civil rights official in the Reagan Education Department.; "But he became more conservative as he went through the process of legal education."; Yale law students, Singleton explained, were exposed to conservative law professors with powerful minds.; "I used to discuss conservative ideas with Clarence and he was interested in them," Singleton said.And so Thomas, who was driven from the Missouri seminary by racism, became one of the beneficiaries of an effort to combat it.; Thomas, who paid for his college education with loans, jobs and the newly raised scholarship funds, soon was drawn into the turbulence of Vietnam War and "black power" politics.; He helped found a Black Student Union, writing and typing its constitution.He steered away from lawsuits based on statistical evidence and remedies that included timetables for future hiring.; But he was unwilling to go along with more strident voices in the Reagan administration who opposed most legal remedies for discrimination, so he often felt isolated from both the administration and the civil rights establishment.; Several years ago, a top Reagan domestic adviser who wanted his coffee cup refilled at a black-tie dinner looked up and spotted a black man in a tuxedo hovering near the table.
