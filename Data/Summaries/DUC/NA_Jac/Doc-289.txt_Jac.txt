In Japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the Tokai area was overdue for a significant quake.Japan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists throughout the world were optimistic about prediction.Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.6m) a year monitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research.The public, and even public officials, remain largely unaware that Japan's scientists are debating whether prediction is impossible or merely difficult.If the committee so advises, Japan's prime minister will issue an earthquake warning for the Tokai area.Japan's prediction research activities, primarily overseen by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, are subject to no such review.Despite the protests, however, Japan's earthquake prediction programme rolls along on inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations.Friction between these plates causes the area's earthquakes.The evidence is that significant strain has accumulated along the fault since the region's last big earthquake.Japan has had numerous killer quakes outside the Tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off the coast of Hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives.
