"Higher wages . . . for some will mean jobs lost for those workers who are trying hardest to break into the labor market," warns GOP Sen.Opponents of raising the minimum wage insist that past increases have had a substantial effect in both layoffs and "disemployment" -- workers not hired who otherwise would have been."That is exactly what raising the minimum wage will do."In 1968, the minimum wage was about 53% of the average hourly wage of a manufacturing employee.Now the minimum amounts to only 34% of the average manufacturing wage."The minimum wage has no bearing on what we do -- it's a forgotten issue," he says.On the face of it, those figures would seem to resolve the age-old debate over whether increases in the minimum wage cost the economy a significant number of lost jobs.No longer does the minimum wage keep all those who earn it above the poverty level: A full-time minimum-wage worker earns less than $7,000 a year, only 80% of what the government considers sufficient to keep a family of three out of poverty, and only 60% of what's needed for a family of four.In 1981, the staff of the Minimum Wage Study Commission, which was appointed by President Carter, estimated that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would trim teen-age employment demand by about 1%, and that rises in that wage have had little impact on overall unemployment.From 1981 through 1986, the minimum wage wasn't raised at all.Between 1978 and 1981, Congress raised the minimum wage four times.In return for administration agreement to raising the wage, Mr. Brock says, Congress must also allow a "youth differential" wage that's lower than the minimum wage, so as not to discourage employers from hiring untrained new job entrants.Ronald Sarasin, a lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association, acknowledges that "we're going to survive" even if the the wage is increased, but warns of the consequences for low-paid workers: "This is less a business issue than a jobs issue."
