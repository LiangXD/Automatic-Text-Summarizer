Most shareholder cases are settled, and Mr. Greenfield says he has had only two jury trials in the past six years, while handling scores of suits.Realistically, it's highly unlikely that the civil cases against Mr. Milken will ever go to trial."It's a very real possibility," said Mr. Greenfield, who has filed several cases against Mr. Milken.While some shareholder attorneys routinely file multimillion-dollar suits whenever a takeover is announced or the market drops, the suits against Mr. Milken seem to be much more likely to succeed than most.Mr. Bromberg and others assert that Mr. Liman, Mr. Milken's principal lawyer, negotiated to make the plea agreement narrow enough so that little of what Mr. Milken admitted to can be used against him in the civil suits.Nonetheless, the plaintiff's lawyers agree that winning a trial against Mr. Milken wouldn't be easy.Also pending are a multitude of civil cases lodged in the past three years against Mr. Boesky, Drexel, Mr. Milken and others that accuse the defendants of insider trading, stock manipulation and other securities law violations.Mr. Greenfield's firm filed the suit along with plaintiff lawyer William S. Lerach of the shareholder law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie and Lerach.Finally, a sprinkling of cases across the country target Mr. Milken among many other defendants in cases alleging that savings and loans associations and other companies suffered losses because they purchased large portfolios of Drexel's junk bonds as part of back-scratching arrangements with Mr. Milken.Steven Rosenfeld, an attorney for Mr. Milken, says there are "no plans whatsoever" for his client to seek bankruptcy-court protection.While the Unocal suit claims enormous damages to shareholders, a suit filed by Mr. Greenfield's firm in February may be even broader.Those charges could be exceedingly helpful to plainitffs lawyers building civil cases against him.But a spokesman for Mr. Pickens's Mesa Petroleum Co., a defendant in the Unocal case, calls the allegations "silly stuff.The raiders felt obligated to buy the bonds because they wanted Mr. Milken to fund their future takeover attempts, the suit says.According to the allegations, a raider would typically tell Mr. Milken he wanted to take over a particular company, and Mr. Milken would then issue junk bonds for the raider's companies and arrange for other raiders to buy the bonds.
