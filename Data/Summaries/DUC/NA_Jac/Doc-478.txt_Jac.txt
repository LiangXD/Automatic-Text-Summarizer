The president's comments came a day after Mrs. Dole told the Senate Labor Committee that Bush's support of legislation to raise the minimum wage would hinge on whether lawmakers included a training wage in the legislation.Mrs. Dole, sworn in to her Cabinet post four hours before the hearing, was not specific as to how high Bush favors raising the minimum wage or what kind of time limit to set on the training wage.Bush's stand puts him in opposition to the head of the Labor Committee, Edward M. Kennedy, who said Thursday he remained opposed to a training wage and was confident his bill to raise the minimum hourly wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 would pass this year.
