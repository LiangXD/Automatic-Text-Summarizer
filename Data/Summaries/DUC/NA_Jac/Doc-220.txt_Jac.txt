"Could the fires survive the winter and pick up and come at us again?"Because of the unprecedented fire season which burned nearly 1.5 million acres in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, including 705,000 acres within the national park, Mrs. Smith and her friends and neighbors worry about what's happening underneath the blanket of snow this winter."The first thing most people around here did was go on vacation," said Patti Smith, owner with her husband, Bob, of the Bearclaw Service and Cabins, a gas station and small motel."The fire really took a toll on a lot of folks.Winter now cloaks Cooke City and Silver Gate, and only about 70 year-round residents remain to weather the below-zero months.The new year ushers in a new wildfire season, an unwelcome thought to the residents of this small Montana tourist town on the northeastern corner of Yellowstone National Park."Are there still smoldering embers out there deep in the roots of the trees?" wondered Mrs. Smith.Nearly four feet of snow has piled up against the Smiths' cabins and "that's just the way I like it," exulted Mrs. Smith.
