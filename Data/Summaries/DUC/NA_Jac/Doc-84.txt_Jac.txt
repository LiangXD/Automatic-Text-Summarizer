Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that an epidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the inner cities.He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic, probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the 1970s.There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS, but that is likely, Vermund said."I think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to the general population," Vermund said.
