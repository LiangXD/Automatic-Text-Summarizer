"The problem with Type II diabetics is not that they don't make enough insulin; they don't respond to the insulin," DeFronzo said."My mother has diabetes and they tell me I might have diabetes, too, but I don't know too much about it."Also, Mexican-Americans tend to have more body fat in their upper torso and we can see that as related to diabetes."An epidemiologist at the center, Dr. Michael Stern, has devoted 10 years to studying Hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study of Type II diabetes.She was told that because of her weight, 254 pounds, she had hypertension and was at risk of diabetes.More than 150,000 Americans die from diabetes each year; another 150,000 deaths are diabetes-related, according to the American Diabetes Association.In obese diabetics, the body has too much insulin because it is burning more fats than sugars.Stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics, fewer would get the disease.
