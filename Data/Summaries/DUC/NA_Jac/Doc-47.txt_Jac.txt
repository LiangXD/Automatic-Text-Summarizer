In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59 killed a year earlier and well below the long-term average of 99 fatalities annually, the National Weather Service reported on Sunday.Last year also recorded the largest tornado outbreak in 14 years.Hot weather stirring the air helps form thunderstorms and their tornadoes, with 60 percent of all twisters occurring between noon and sunset, according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research.Meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths in recent years to increased public awareness of the storms, which are most common in May and June but can occur in any month of the year.Last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths, but even so, more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation.Unusually warm and wet weather last November helped trigger a record number of tornadoes for that month, at 121 across the country.
