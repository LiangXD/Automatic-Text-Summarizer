But the court's decision affected only term limits on state officials; federal officeholders weren't included in California's limits.Should the court rule against term limits by the states, numerous other ballot access restrictions will likely be passed that have many of the same effects as term limits.Federal courts have upheld many state restrictions on who may qualify for ballot access.States could allow an incumbent who has served a set number of years in the same office to run again, but only as a "write-in" candidate.Term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his or her ideology or party.Each candidate would have to answer the question: "Will you adhere to a -- year term limit?"The answer would appear on the ballot so voters would know a candidate's views on term limits.Viewed in this way, term limits imposed by states would be constitutional.They argued that voters were denied the right to be represented by the same legislator indefinitely, and that term limits discriminated against incumbents and denied them their right to equal protection of the laws.As recently as June of this year, the Supreme Court again reiterated that the states have reserved to themselves, via the Tenth Amendment, "the power to regulate elections."Fashing, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that a particular candidate has no "fundamental" right to ballot access or to run for office.
