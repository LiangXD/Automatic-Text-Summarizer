Davidson said he is confident that Latinos will respond to education efforts on diabetes.If you have already a predisposed group of people, such as the Latinos, you get more obesity and you get more diabetes."Any Latino woman whose child was born at 9 pounds or larger should consider herself at risk of diabetes and alter her diet, Davidson said.Latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are Anglos, and incidence of the disease increases with age.The number of Latino diabetics in the United States will nearly quadruple by the year 2000 to 8 million, according to projections by Eli Lilly Co. Caring for them will cost more than $10 billion a year, even if the disease has no complications, the company projects."Many people think that when Latinos come here (to the United States) they gain weight because they continue to eat the way they ate at home.That is why the American Diabetes Assn. and other health education groups in the Los Angeles area and California have begun a major push to educate Latinos about diabetes.In addition, Latino diets can be rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote obesity and increase the chance of getting diabetes.Nationwide, it is estimated that there are more than 2 million Latinos who already have diabetes, many of them undiagnosed.Other barriers to Latinos getting care for diabetes are more subtle, doctors interested in the issue say.Genetically controlled defects in the body's insulin system are also thought to exist both for them and Latinos.In one survey done in San Antonio, a third of the Latinos between the ages of 55 and 65 had diabetes, Davidson said."We need to get into the communities and start teaching the kids and the adolescents and the parents to make some changes in their habits," said Dr. Jaime Davidson, a Dallas physician who has spearheaded the diabetes association's Latino education efforts.DIABETES COMPLICATIONS According to the American Diabetes Assn., in the United States every year:Like heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among Latinos is a condition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors say."We need to give them the opportunity to enter the health care system, and we need to give them the opportunity to learn that diabetes is the biggest health care issue that they are going to face into the year 2000."The effort is being aided by interested physicians and by drug companies, which make insulin and other drugs used for diabetes that can't be controlled by changes in eating habits.Chief among these is that the Latino patient is less likely to volunteer information or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the Anglo patient, said Dr. Aliza Lifshitz, a board member of the California Hispanic American Medical Assn.
