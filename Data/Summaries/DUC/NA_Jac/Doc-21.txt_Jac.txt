I think we're approaching that breaking point," said Van Hayden, 25, a student who says police beat him at the hotel.The city's police chief, John Laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society.In a series of rallies in recent weeks, protesters demanded that officers involved in the drug raid be suspended, charges against those arrested at the hotel be dropped, and that a citizen police review board be established.Laux opposes establisment of a citizen panel to look into police actions.Allegations of police misconduct currently are reviewed by a panel appointed by the mayor.Everyone always says, 'I can't believe this is happening in Minnesota, in Minneapolis, the home of progressiveness.'"The matter of police misconduct and brutality has been going on for at least the 21 years I've been here, but I think the deaths pushed the issue beyond the point of tolerance that usually is the case in matters of police misconduct," Glover said.
