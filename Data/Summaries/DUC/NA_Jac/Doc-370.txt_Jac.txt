The Richter scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake.Separate strong earthquakes rocked northern Japan and the main Philippine island of Luzon today, swaying buildings and trees but apparently not causing any serious injuries or damage, officials said.Earthquakes measuring 5 on the open-ended Richter scale are classified as strong and capable of causing considerable damage in populated areas.In 1968, the Tokachi-Oki earthquake measuring a 7.9 on the Richter scale killed 52 people.
