Two hundred years ago in Philadelphia, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention considered a proposal to join executive and judicial authority in a "council of revision" - a body that would have authority to reject and reshape laws enacted by the legislature.Law making -- policy making -- by judges has become so pervasive that, of late, many see it as the judicial function against which potential judges must be measured.The Constitution, however, commands a neutral-principled approach to judicial decision making, and a Bork confirmation would help restore the balance among the three branches of government the framers so carefully crafted.Currently on the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., Judge Bork is recognized as perhaps this country's most distinguished judicial scholar.The answer is that Judge Bork is a "neutral-principled" judge -- a judge who makes decisions based on established legal principles irrespective of the "bottom line" of who may win and who may lose.Far from being ideologically partisan, as some have charged, Judge Bork holds fast to a neutral-principled approach irrespective of whose ox is being gored: "The sin of wanting judges to do good things simply because the electorate won't do them," he explained in the same interview, "is not confined to liberalism.Commenting on Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, Geoffrey Stone, dean of the University of Chicago Law School, called it "a four-star appointment" and commented that it was rare "to get anyone with anywhere near his credentials."More than 150 years earlier, Francis Bacon had warned judges to remember that "their office is jus dicere, and not jus dare; to interpret law, and not to make law, or give law."In many respects, the judiciary has become the "master" branch of government because we have permitted judges' personal views to supplant the rule of established law.
