"On the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the captain acted the best way he knew how," said William E. Brooks Jr., publisher of the Vincennes Sun-Commercial newspaper and a member of the USS Vincennes Association.It was the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of Vincennes."The other thing, in my opinon, this is the other side of the Stark incident," Brooks said, referring to the May 1987 Iraqi jet attack on the U.S. missile frigate Stark, which cost 37 American lives.The USS Vincennes' destruction of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake organization said Sunday."But the captain defended the ship and did what he thought was best for the personnel," he added.
