In an interview with the media on the last day of his stay in Australia, he went so far as to say that Chinese officials do not understand the international status and importance of Hong Kong so their criticism of him does not conform to reality, adding that Hong Kong is an "international asset" as well as China's asset.How can Patten be compared with the Chinese Government where the understanding of Hong Kong's international status and its importance are concerned.Nevertheless, it is internationally accepted that while the Hong Kong issue is a matter for both China and Britain before 1997, it is purely a Chinese internal affair after 1997.How can China's sovereignty over Hong Kong be evaded!Patten's allegation that the Chinese side does not understand Hong Kong's "international status" is entirely nonsense.What Patten has said and done since he arrived in Hong Kong, including the "international card," has been designed to meticulously carry through the third step laid down by the British Government.Does this not clearly show that China's sovereignty over Hong Kong was evaded or even denied?In saying Hong Kong is an international asset, Patten intentionally evaded the problem of to whom Hong Kong belongs.He also called on the international community to see to it that China honor its commitment after 1997 and alleged that Britain bears a "moral responsibility" for Hong Kong, and so on.In early May last year, he openly alleged that Hong Kong was an "international asset" in a speech in Washington.Though he repeatedly argued in his defense that he did not go to Australia in search of support for his constitutional package, the fact he talked a great deal about his constitutional package and requested Australia to pass on "genuine democracy" to Hong Kong reveals that he visited Australia to seek international support for this constitutional package, of which the first part will be put to the vote, after his constitutional package had drawn sharp criticism and came in for questioning at the British Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee hearings.
