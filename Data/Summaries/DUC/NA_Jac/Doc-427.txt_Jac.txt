Those profits resulted in Lincoln's making $31 million in tax-sharing payments to its parent company. </P> <P> American Continental executives rejected the government's characterization of the Hidden Valley loans.Lincoln executives agreed to make the loan, regulators allege, but there was a condition. </P> <P> According to the government's racketeering lawsuit, the following events occurred: </P> <P> As a condition of lending him the money he wanted, Lincoln asked Garcia to buy 1,000 acres of land owned by a Lincoln subsidiary for $14 million.They said also that the price the insiders received for their stock was slightly below prevailing market prices. </P> <P> And any allegations of boosting stock prices to get money out of the employee stock ownership plan through the sales, they said, fall flat because most of such stock purchases occurred in 1985, long before the allegedly fraudulent transactions occurred. </P> <P> Example Cited </P> <P> One example of how Lincoln conducted its business, according to government regulators, is a loan it made to Ernest C. Garcia, a Phoenix-area developer. </P> <P> Early in 1987, Garcia approached Lincoln to see if he could borrow money to buy the remaining stock in a company in which he already held a 20% interest.What's more, he proposed a rule to require all federally insured thrifts, including state-chartered S&amp;Ls such as Lincoln, to limit direct investments to 10% of their assets. </P> <P> Keating for one was furious.In 1983, the state allowed thrifts to put 100% of their money into direct investments. </P> <P> From his headquarters in Phoenix, Keating spotted a California thrift that seemed ideal for his expanding purposes. </P> <P> Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan was an Orange County thrift that had experienced losses in the early 1980s, but it had returned to profitability by the end of 1983.Wall ordered a new examination directed by Washington-based regulators. </P> <P> Instead of absolving Lincoln, however, the new audit reached even more damaging conclusions.Lincoln, they said, was entitled to record the profits on the loans. </P> <P> The recommendations of the regional regulators were not adopted by Gray or M.The bankruptcy case prevented regulators from assuming full control of some of Lincoln's assets. </P> <P> Also, it created an unusual group of victims.The California Department of Corporations approved the sales, even though the agency's own staff and the state's top savings and loan regulators expressed concern about the company's financial condition and ability to repay the debt. </P> <P> In little more than two years, American Continental sold about $200 million worth of debt securities to nearly 22,000 investors.She took her life insurance proceeds and "practically beat down the door" at the Lincoln branch to buy American Continental debt securities. </P> <P> After being assured that Lincoln was safe and sound, she had signed two pieces of paper and handed over a $30,000 cashier's check.About the same time, the state Department of Savings and Loan allowed American Continental to set up desks in the lobbies of Lincoln's 29 branches to sell the securities. </P> <P> Although the securities were, in effect, junk bonds, Keating said he would have recommended them to anyone, even to the Roman Catholic charities he supported heavily with donations.Meantime, executives argued, the parent company could invest Lincoln's tax payments any way it chose. </P> <P> The tax plan was reviewed and approved by regulators, they pointed out. </P> <P> They sold stock to the employee stock ownership plan, the executives said, because the plan, by its very nature, required the purchase of American Continental stock. </P> <P> Because the stock was thinly traded, the plan could not acquire the big blocks of stock it needed except through sales by insiders.Greenspan produced a report opposing it. </P> <P> Although executives at other savings and loans also lobbied against the direct investment rule, Keating was perhaps the most prominent and persistent opponent. </P> <P> Keating arranged for a congressional resolution that called on Gray to delay implementing the investment restriction for six months.Lincoln agreed to the arrangement and lent Westcon $10.5 million, or 75% of the purchase price. </P> <P> At the same time, Lincoln lent Garcia $20.2 million, and Garcia lent $3.5 million of that amount to Westcon.About two-thirds of them were elderly Southern Californians who bought them at Lincoln branch offices. </P> <P> Some of them have said in lawsuits and congressional testimony that they were persuaded to buy the securities instead of certificates of deposit by American Continental sales representatives, who assured them that the securities were safe. </P> <P> Some have said they thought that the debentures were backed by federal deposit insurance -- a costly mistake, as things turned out. </P> <P> Regulators Cool </P> <P> By 1986, federal regulators in the regional office in San Francisco were becoming distinctly unsympathetic to Keating's operations.Regulators insisted, for instance, on using standards that applied to single-family loans to evaluate Lincoln's commercial loans.Instead, American Continental collected money from all its subsidiaries, then filed a consolidated tax return and made tax payments to the IRS on their behalf. </P> <P> Over a period of a little more than two years, Lincoln made $95 million in tax-sharing payments to its parent company, ostensibly to cover taxes on profits it had earned. </P> <P> But the government alleges in its racketeering lawsuit and other documents that Lincoln did not owe $95 million in taxes at the time and that American Continental never paid any of that money to the IRS. </P> <P> Keating and his subordinates engaged in a series of sham transactions designed to create the appearance of higher profits, and thus higher tax obligations, as a device for siphoning money out of Lincoln and moving it to American Continental, which kept the extra funds, according to federal investigators. </P> <P> Higher profits also boosted American Continental's stock price.But, instead of selling them through Wall Street brokerages and other investment firms, they would peddle the securities to Lincoln customers. </P> <P> The California Department of Corporations routinely approved American Continental's first request to sell the debt securities, called subordinated debentures.The suit and other documents allege that Keating and his associates sought to evade regulatory restrictions on such investments by making bogus loans to "straw" property buyers. </P> <P> They also devised a tax plan that let them divert $95 million to Lincoln's parent company by creating "phantom" profits through sham land swaps and loans, the regulators allege, and used accounting gimmicks, legal maneuvering and political string-pulling to further their operations and slow down investigators. </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee decided last week to appoint an outside counsel to investigate Sen.In fact, the Sisters of Charity in Cincinnati bought $444,000 of the securities. </P> <P> In early 1988, American Continental sought approval for a second debenture offering.
