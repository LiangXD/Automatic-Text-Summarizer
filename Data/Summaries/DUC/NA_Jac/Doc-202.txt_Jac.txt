At its peak, the project will employ about 11,000 workers and 11 tunneling machines.Tunneling machines simultaneously dig, remove rock and put up tunnel walls.The tunnel, 80-130 feet below the seabed, was 2 miles into the channel from this end Oct.The tunnels are to be completed in 1991, then the railroad tracks will be laid.Also, the governments signed a tunnel treaty in February 1986 and both would have to agree to cancellation.British stations, bridges and tunnels are not built for the tall loads commonly carried across the channel.Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium that will own the tunnel, is urging British Rail to speed its plans.Construction of the two one-way train tunnels begins in December.Tunneling speed at the Dover end is less than 15 feet an hour and the machine boring from the geologically more complex French end moves even slower, which is why the tunnel will not open until 1993.
