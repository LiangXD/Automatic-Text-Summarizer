Guilty people who pass the test leave undetected.; Those accuracy claims are challenged by polygraph opponents, who point to studies done by polygraphers themselves that say an innocent person has as much as a 50-50 chance of failing.Results were matched against the suspects' polygraphs, and in 90 percent of the cases, they agreed.; "There isn't any single study that resolves the controversy when one wants to know the accuracy of the polygraph in the real world," said Frank Horvath, president of the American Polygraph Association and professor of criminology at Michigan State University at East Lansing.; Both sides expect the controversy to go on for as long as it takes science to come up with the perfect lie detector."But we aren't made like Pinocchio."; The public usually hears about polygraph tests when somebody famous takes one, often in situations where it's one person's word against another.Other studies show more accurate results for guilty people, saying they are correctly identified 79 percent of the time or better.; One of the most famous accuracy studies cited by polygraph advocates was conducted in 1969 by psychologist Philip Bersh for the U.S. Department of Defense.; 90 percent agreement; A panel of lawyers reviewed evidence (other than the polygraph test) against 400 criminal suspects, then concluded whether the suspects were innocent or guilty."The guilty person is going to be afraid of getting caught, while the innocent person is afraid of being wrongly accused."; But veteran San Jose polygrapher George Harman said anxiety and nervousness do not affect his results.; "The problem is when you have a person with not enough nervousness," Harman said.Polygraphers can be sly and manipulative in the interest of producing an accurate test.
