But in 1990, voters declared a plague on both parties' houses, underscoring what polls and other focus groups demonstrate: The disaffection with politicians isn't ideological.Mr. Ferris believes this would "put a vitality in the system" while not resulting, unlike overall term limits, in "a bunch of neophytes who'd be more dependent on staff and lobbyists."Term limits would accomplish few of their proponents' goals -- more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists.If lawmakers had to change areas of expertise every three or four terms, "they wouldn't have the luxury of being intellectually lazy."But there's little consensus among either politicians or the voters themselves on these issues.Currently, the Intelligence committees in both houses and the House Budget Committee limit members to six or eight years."Term limits really hit at democracy," says Prof. Fenno.A powerful antidote would be to limit committee service, which would have few of the political and constitutional drawbacks of term limits.
