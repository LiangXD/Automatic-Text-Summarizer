Floating Oil Booms Gonzales, the Coast Guard spokesman, said the terminal has cleanup equipment on site for minor spills."There (was) no oil (cleanup equipment) out there and it's been 14 hours since it happened.U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer John Gonzales said in a telephone interview from Valdez that the spill was staying "in the mid-channel" and did not seem to be moving toward the shore.Leak a Mere Trickle A representative of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the tanker had been spilling oil at a rate of 10,000 barrels an hour but the Coast Guard said the leak had become a mere trickle by 2:30 p.m., Alaska time.Another Exxon tanker was attempting to pump the oil out of the crippled vessel, and two Coast Guard investigators were on board the Valdez, he said."We've been able to brag for a long time that there's never been a major oil spill in Valdez Harbor.He said that state officials were considering the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the oil.A Long Beach-bound Exxon oil tanker ran aground on a reef Friday and spilled an estimated 8.4 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound, a pristine Pacific waterway heavily used by kayakers, fishermen and tourists."We've had no report of any wildlife hurt at this time," he said.The spill is expected to add fuel to a campaign by environmentalists to prevent further oil development in Alaska, particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.Steve Cowper arrived in Valdez on Friday to evaluate the spill.The immediate response to the spill was handled by crews from the terminal at Valdez.It was the largest Alaskan oil spill ever.Jon Nelson, a deputy regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage, said the reef ripped a 150-foot gash in the vessel, which was carrying 1.2 million barrels of oil, and there was fear that the tanker could break apart further.Prince William Sound, home to orcas, sea otters and fur seals, is important to both the fishing and the recreation industries.
