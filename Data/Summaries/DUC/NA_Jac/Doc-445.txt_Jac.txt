Until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well.; Waves of hot ash; Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.; If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.; "In the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with glowing ash, Lipman said.; Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal.
