When the rules were initially adopted by the International Maritime Organization, it was assumed that older vessels would pass out of service, but this did not happen, according to Marjorie Murtagh of the Coast Guard, the U.S. fire-safety representative at the International Maritime Organization.; Of the 100 large vessels now operating from U.S. ports -- all but two are of foreign registry -- 72 are more than 10 years old, 23 are more than 20 years old and 26 are more than 30 years old, according to figures in the Coast Guard magazine Proceedings of the Marine Safety Council.Roger Kohn, information officer for the maritime organization in London, said the loss of the Oceanos "tended to confirm a general feeling that something must be done."; John T. Estes, president of the International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the owners of most of the ocean-going cruise vessels, said that his organization favored all the proposed new rules, but not the proposed effective dates.; When the safety committee met in May, it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations beyond 1994 for new ships, possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service of vessels that cannot meet the new rules.; Estes said that accounting for the lead time required for ship design, his organization favors 1996 for enforcing the rules on new construction and major reconstruction.; The 15 major cruise ships that call in New York have passed inspections without difficulty, according to Comdr."The average age of ships today is 16 years, which is already fairly elderly in shipping terms and old ships need more maintenance and repair," he said in a statement last month.; In May, the safety committee of the International Maritime Organization met in London to begin amending the Safety of Life at Sea rules.; The proposed amendments, which are supported by the majority of the member countries, require that new ships' atriums have smoke-detection systems, smoke-exhaust systems, two means of escape and an automatic sprinkler system.; The committee also discussed a phase-out of the grandfather rules.
