the sharp deterioration in relations between britain and china over hong kong's political future has cast a pall over the colony's financial markets. relations between the uk and china have deteriorated markedly since mr patten, with the general support of the hong kong people, announced proposals on october 7 for elections in 1994 and 1995 which would allow for greater, though still limited, democracy in choosing local leaders. such a head-to-head contest between beijing and britain's governor in hong kong would be without precedent in the colony. on friday, lu ping, china's top official on hong kong affairs, said beijing would challenge the validity of future elections and abrogate agreements to build the colony's multi-billion dollar airport if mr patten proceeded without china's agreement. in a robust performance before a special session of the legislative council (legco) on saturday, mr patten reissued his challenge to beijing to respond with constructive alternatives to proposals he made on october 7 for the colony's political development. the governor said he was prepared to discuss these alternatives with china but reminded legislators that any alternatives had to be fair, open and command the support of the people of hong kong. mr patten has said, however, that what he finally proposes has to be 'acceptable to the people of hong kong'.
