like thousands of other farmers in peru's upper huallaga valley, they discovered that while cacao and coffee could give their families enough to eat, coca could make them rich. development workers, farmers and priests in the area say that the rebels have steadily streamed into the upper huallaga, a vast stretch of jungle northeast of lima, and the biggest coca-growing zone in the world. but more important, if it were admitted that guerrillas are in large numbers in the upper huallaga, the army might again be given emergency control over the zone. government officials from the anti-drug police (umopar) and the coca-eradication unit (corah) sent into the region to wipe out drug production were often confined to their barracks by the army they simply were not allowed to carry on with their work. the guerrillas now present themselves as the defenders of the coca farmers, says segundo ramirez, owner of aucayacu's radio station. during the january strike, the guerrillas killed an alleged thief and a seller of coca-paste cigarettes, according to a crop substitution program worker who works directly with the farmers in the area. the government's problem in combatting the current violence and influence of the shining path is how to ensure that army troops sent into this coca-rich region won't become corrupted by the lure of drug money, as they reportedly did in the past.
