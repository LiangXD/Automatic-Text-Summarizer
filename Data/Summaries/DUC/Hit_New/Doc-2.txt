mad cow disease has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. because of the disease, the u.s. department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service in july banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from britain, said margaret webb, a usda spokeswoman in washington. david maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of bse hysteria in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is remote. the report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies. according to a report in the british medical journal, the incidence of creutzfeldt-jakob disease is no higher in britain than it is in countries free of scrapie. it is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of bse on human health, a consultative committee reported to the agriculture ministry. the committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a shrewd guess that bse is transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.
