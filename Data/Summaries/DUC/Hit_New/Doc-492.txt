"if you suddenly cash in your insurance policy to buy a so-called peace dividend, you will get neither," gen. colin powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said in a speech to the national press club. powell's blunt remarks were his first major commentary on the debate over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of lessened east-west tensions. "we must not confuse a decline in defense spending with a decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal with the enduring realities we face," powell said. powell said defense secretary dick cheney's plan released earlier this week to cut military forces by 25 percent over five years shows "we are willing to examine any reasonable proposal." the administration budget blueprint, powell said, will begin to reduce the nation's forces over time. "on this glide path we will reach a base force which i believe is not prudent to go below if we wish to match enduring defense needs with enduring realities," powell said. we're cutting troops, and believe it or not _ we're cutting generals," powell said.
