dealing with his first major hurricane as director of the national hurricane center, bob sheets wasn't skipping a beat tuesday as a multitude of reporters fired questions at him. sheets, who was acting director during the 1987 atlantic hurricane season and was named director in march, spent most of the morning on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large monitor showing the destructive hurricane gilbert sprawled across much of the western caribbean. the transition from former director neil frank, widely known for his distinctive style and flattop haircut, to sheets, his dark blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a gray wool-blend jacket, has been a smooth one. and interest in gilbert has been high since it started packing hurricane-force winds over the weekend and by tuesday afternoon became a category 5 storm with winds of 160 mph and a central pressure of 26.66 inches. the major television networks, local stations and newspapers media were on hand to monitor the hurricane, which could reach the gulf of mexico by thursday, said sheets. and while sheets might appear to be spend most of his day with tiny microphones snaking down his back for tv interviews and fielding questions, he also writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts. dealing with a major hurricane isn't much different from dealing with smaller ones or tropical storms, sheets said, adding that gilbert has been particularly "well-behaved."
