the focus of the drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most areas, the national weather service reported thursday. long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the great lakes region and the ohio and tennessee valleys, the agency's climate analysis center reported. at the beginning of july, 29 percent of the nation was undergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said. the drought has been accompanied by higher than normal temperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western great lakes region. the national picture shows the current drought to be about equivalent to that of 1911, and still somewhat less severe than in several years in the 1930s or 1956. recent rains have resulted in local flooding in texas, but nationally streamflows are below normal, and even in texas are expected to fall back to below average levels. in addition to thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-range outlook through july 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain hotter than normal, particularly the tennessee valley, lower midwest, central and northern great plains, northern rockies and great basin.
