a year behind schedule and five years in the making, biosphere 2 has forged ahead despite questions about its credibility, charges of cultism and accusations that leaders bullied departed consultants. the creation of billionaire oil mogul edward bass, biosphere 2 aims to study how people can live in an airtight world. 'nasa could never do this' nasa could never do this, countered robert frye, a project consultant and ecologist at the university of arizona's environmental research laboratory. news reports since 1985 have linked the project's leaders to a 1970s commune where, some ex-commune members say, biosphere 2 executive john allen led a cult devoted to creating a new civilization. leader was a 'tyrant' laurence veysey, a retired history professor from the university of california, santa cruz, who studied the commune in 1971, remembers allen as a tyrant given to rages. in the years since the commune disbanded, allen's vision and bass's deep pockets have funded ecological ventures from katmandu to france to western australia. there have been so many people with biosphere 2 who never had anything to do with john allen 20 years ago.
