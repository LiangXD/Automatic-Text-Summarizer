'only god can help us through this crisis,' said the afrikaner preacher called to provide spiritual guidance to south africa's farmers, who have been hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory. indeed, in the eastern transvaal town of bethal, where dominee nel was delivering his sermon at a farmers' meeting earlier this week, elderly residents say this drought is the worst since 1933. mr jg wilson of the local agricultural co-operative says maize farmers in the area - one of the largest maize producing regions - have already lost 80 to 100 per cent of their crops. farmers who produce maize, south africa's staple food, will be the hardest hit, with stock farmers also at risk. none the less, pretoria is understood to be contemplating substantial drought aid for farmers: several hundred million rands, or perhaps as much as r1bn (pounds 200m) over two to three years. without such aid, the maize board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de grace. millions of black subsistence farmers will also be victims of drought, with the charity operation hunger warning that hunger could turn to starvation soon in many rural areas.
