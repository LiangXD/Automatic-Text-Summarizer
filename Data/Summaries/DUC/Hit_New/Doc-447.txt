the 1980s was a very interesting decade because of the number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring information, said steven brantley, a geologist with the survey's cascades volcano observatory in vancouver, wash. scientists say the eruption of mount st. helens, which killed 57 people and caused $1 billion in property damage, triggered a renaissance in volcano research. it alerted the american public to volcano hazards and prompted a tenfold increase in government spending for volcano research and monitoring, said geologist robert tilling of usgs in menlo park. one, in washington, keeps track of active volcanoes in the cascades range of the pacific northwest and northern california, including mount st. helens, mount rainier, mount hood, mount baker, mount shasta and mount lassen. american scientists have since responded to a number of volcanic awakenings throughout the world, from galunggung in indonesia to nevado del ruiz in colombia, improving their ability to quickly evaluate volcano hazards. 1. surveying: researchers measure the volcano, with optical instruments or high-tech laser tools, to see if it is bulging or stretching as a result of magma rising inside. the amount of gas reflects the amount of magma beneath the volcano, and thus the potential size of the eruption.
