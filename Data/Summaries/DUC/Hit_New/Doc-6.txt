government veterinary and health experts were yesterday putting out reassuring messages about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse), or 'mad cow' disease, in the face of growing public anxiety. dr kenneth calman, the government's chief medical officer, yesterday repeated the official advice that beef can be eaten safely: 'there is no scientific evidence of a causal link between bse in cattle and cjd in humans.' it was revealed this week that mr peter warhurst, a dairy farmer whose herd had a bse case in 1989, died last year of creutzfeld-jacob disease. dr robert will of western general hospital, edinburgh, who is monitoring all cjd cases in the uk for the department of health, drew attention to mr warhurst's case without naming him in the lancet, a medical journal. statistical analysis, taking account of the average national incidence of cjd and the number of people working on bse-affected dairy farms, shows that the probability of one cjd case having occurred among the latter group by chance is about 1 in 20. even so, dr will believes that mr warhurst's disease was a coincidence not related to bse exposure. his study has shown no change in the pattern of cjd since bse started and no other cases among people working with cattle, such as abattoir staff or vets.
