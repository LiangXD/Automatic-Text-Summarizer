bush and sununu formed a close bond during the 1988 campaign, in the snows of new hampshire, when bush saw his presidential dream slipping away after a humiliating showing in iowa. whatever they did in iowa, they will not reject george bush in new hampshire, sununu vowed, as he dragged bush down from his elite perch to start what he called a see me, touch me, feel me campaign. but on matters of politics, george bush and john sununu were not so oddly matched. in the many times over the past three years when sununu helped land the president in the political soup, the washington political cognoscenti speculated that bush was keeping his chief of staff only out of loyalty to sununu for helping him win the new hampshire primary, or because bush was too nice to fire anyone, or because he was too indecisive. while sununu's lack of political skill in dealing with political washington eventually cost him his job, and while his fatal flaw may have been in believing that he was smarter than george bush, the chief of staff was -- often in an inept way -- trying to fulfill the mandate he had been given by his boss. as bush tried to be the ultimate washington insider, the chief of staff alienated congress, cabinet members, house republicans and the press, who disdained sununu because they believed he misled them. his approval ratings began dropping again, important republicans scorned by sununu began going on the record with their advice to bush that he was being ill served by his chief of staff, and finally and most important, the president's wife, barbara, and oldest son, george, turned on sununu.
