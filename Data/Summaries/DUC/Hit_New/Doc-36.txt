scientists missed by 150 years in dating the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tablet that also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researchers said today. scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse, recorded on a clay tablet found in syria, occurred on may 3, 1375 b.c. "apparently the anxiety caused by the eclipse of the sun and the sudden appearance of mars had to be resolved by an explanation through liver divination," wrote the researchers from the university of amsterdam and leiden university. they concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tablet misidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred. in addition, the text apparently indicates that mars was visible at the time of the eclipse, the dutch researchers said. they compared those criteria and the likely age range for the tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible from ugarit. even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed, it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, edwin krupp, director of the griffith observatory in los angeles, said in a telephone interview.
