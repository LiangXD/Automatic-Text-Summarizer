in norman, okla., the woman whose complaints prompted the extraordinary weekend hearings on sexual harassment allegations against thomas said she hoped his confirmation wouldn't stop others from complaining about harassment in the workplace. if thomas is sworn in, as expected, on monday, he will have missed oral arguments in 20 cases, including high-visibility disputes over school desegregation and abortion. with that issue undecided, thomas backers argued that he was entitled to a presumption of innocence and a number of democrats agreed. the hearings on the harassment charges led only four previously pro-thomas democrats to change their minds and vote against him: richard bryan and harry reid of nevada, joseph lieberman of connecticut and bob graham of florida. edward kennedy, d-mass., said: to give the benefit of the doubt to judge thomas is to say that judge thomas is more important than the supreme court. as the youngest supreme court justice, thomas is expected to remain on the high court for decades, long enough to grapple with anticipated 21st-century legal issues stemming from new reproductive technologies, gay and lesbian claims to family rights, experimental drugs, multinational business arrangements and other developments. (*)the four democrats who switched their votes from favoring to opposing thomas were lieberman of connecticut, graham of florida and bryan and reid of nevada.
