for example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections. forcing senior members of a legislature to retire means that the new candidates who try to take their place will have to invest heavily in achieving the name recognition that the veterans already have. this will require large new infusions of money and electoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it. veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment. inexperienced legislators are less powerful in relation to legislative staff, executive branch bureaucrats and interest-group lobbyists from whom they must learn the customs and routines of legislative operations and the stories behind policy proposals. term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who surround them. more likely, groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term limitations to improve their chances of winning office.
