carl lewis said he knew ben johnson was taking performance-enhancing drugs just after their 100-meter final last fall at the seoul olympics. according to francis' testimony, johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples. lewis had finished second to johnson, who set a world record of 9.79 seconds in winning the 100-meter gold medal, and subsequently also had to be tested. lewis said sunday that officials of the international amateur athletics federation should disallow johnson's world record from rome because francis has testified his sprinter took drugs before the world championships. if that were to happen, lewis would replace johnson as the world record-holder. if it has been proven that he took drugs, i would think that (withdrawing the record) is the responsible thing for the sport, lewis said sunday. lewis also contended that francis' testimony painted a false picture as to why johnson would take performance-enhancing drugs.
