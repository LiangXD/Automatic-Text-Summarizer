in the narrowest sense, judge thomas and ms. hill are staking their own reputations, personal credibility and careers on this session. the players in today's drama could pursue a number of strategies, each with enormous risks: clarence thomas judge thomas has to answer whether he dated, or tried to date, ms. hill. the witnesses judge thomas has summoned on his behalf will seek to pick her story apart, citing telephone log comments indicating that ms. hill just called to say hello or needs your advice on getting research grants or wanted to congratulate on marriage. ms. hill will need to convincingly explain or refute those messages, as well as reports that have judge thomas, for example, helping her land a job on the law faculty at oral roberts university. and ms. hill will also be asked why she didn't broach her sexual-harassment charges in confirmation hearings for earlier posts that judge thomas won. and though questions of sexual propriety weigh heavily on mr. hatch, who has a reputation for being strait-laced, he can be expected to question ms. hill aggressively and to be an assertive advocate of judge thomas. arlen specter of pennsylvania, like mr. leahy a former prosecutor, has already spoken to judge thomas about ms. hill's charges.
