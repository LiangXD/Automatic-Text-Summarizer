mother nature conspired against this struggling marathon sunday, serving up balmy, windy weather and wilting both the men's and women's fields. among the men, paul davies-hale of england proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever. the race conditions were simply more bad luck for the 12th running of chicago's marathon, which has been fighting for respectability since losing its sponsor in 1986 and staging no race in 1987. davies-hale caught the second pack at 13 miles and met up with pre-race favorite steve binns, who lives 30 miles from davies-hale in england's west midlands. in the women's race, weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with that handicapping. it was the same spot, the corner of wells and north avenue, that weidenbach had taken the lead in last year's race. ann cody morris won the women's wheelchair race in 1:58:51.
