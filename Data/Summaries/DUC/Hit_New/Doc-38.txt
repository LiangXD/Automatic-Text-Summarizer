the sky will grow darker, as if dusk has fallen, until the sun is completely blocked out for a few minutes as the moon's shadow falls on the earth. the eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of tuxpan, on mexico's west coast. it's romantic images like these that are inspiring a last-minute surge of would-be eclipse-watchers, travel agents say. but after enveloping the big island and then slicing across southern baja, the moon's shadow will cross the gulf of california and race across the southern flank of mexico and down the west coast of central america. with the eclipse, there's concern the overbooking could be particularly bad, especially on inter-island flights in hawaii. that's important because many eclipse-watchers haven't been able to book a flight directly to the big island. if you're interested an eight-page brochure on the july 11 eclipse is available for $2 from the astronomical society of the pacific, 390 ashton ave., san francisco, ca 94112.
