"we expect that the new law will ban 80 percent of the approximately 2 million polygraph tests given annually," goldberg said in a prepared statement. the law's restrictions will be felt most heavily in 28 states that lack their own statutes restricting the use of lie detectors, goldberg said. the law prohibits an employee from being fired, disciplined or discriminated against solely for refusing to submit to a polygraph examination. "complaints about polygraph abuse and firings based on polygraph abuse have been one of the single largest sources of calls to aclu offices nationwide," goldberg said. "now employees can complain to the department of labor or go into court to protect themselves against these inaccurate gadgets," goldberg said. goldberg said employers in the following states, which allow businesses to request people to take lie detector tests, could be affected by the new law: california, hawaii, idaho, maryland, montana, nebraska, pennsylvania and wisconsin. the remaining 14 states and the district of columbia have laws banning polygraph examinations for employment purposes, and these laws take precedence over the new federal statute if they are more restrictive, according to goldberg.
