bill rodgers, a four-time boston marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at mr. kelley: it's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing. even the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385 yards leaves some of mr. kelley's rivals of yesteryear gasping. a two-time winner in boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, mr. kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year -- as he has been for 15 years. though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the boston marathon, mr. kelley is the oldest to run it. of course, mr. kelley -- not to be confused with the other john kelley, who won the boston marathon in 1957 -- isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32 minutes, 7 seconds. mr. kelley well knows the jagged course from hopkinton to downtown boston: the first challenge comes five miles into the race, where a set of little hills can get a psyched runner to waste energy charging up the slopes. he isn't particular about brands of shoes ( i wear them all ) or what he eats ( i never eat broccoli, but i love steak and ice cream. ) mr. kelley aims to run till he is at least 100 years old.
