after years of debate, court rulings and federal legislation, use of the polygraph has dropped sharply, despite supporters who insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a lie. last week, the state supreme court banned lie detector tests from being introduced as evidence in criminal trials. massachusetts had been one of the last remaining states that gave defendants the right to use polygraphs to support their alibis. reading from a defense department statement regarding the use of polygraphs, turner said: "in all instances the polygraph exam process produced data of important security or criminal significance which was not otherwise obtainable. many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if both the prosecution and defense agree. new mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a polygraph examination as evidence, with the trial judge deciding whether the tests meet certain standards. david raskin, a university of utah psychologist often called upon to support polygraphs in the courtroom, said he favored the federal law because lie detectors were being misused to predict future performance in the workplace.
