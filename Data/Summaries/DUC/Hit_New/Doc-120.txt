the petitioners' target that sunny day last spring was deconcini, a longtime opponent of gun-control measures who had suddenly switched sides, sponsoring one of the nine bills currently in congress to ban the sale of assault weapons. over the nra's opposition, congress and state legislatures have enacted legislation banning cop-killer bullets that penetrate protective vests, plastic guns that can be slipped past metal detectors and saturday night specials that are used in many crimes. the ban so infuriated some nra members that they have launched petition drives in two dozen states to oust bush from the organization. at the same time, gun-control organizations are beginning to match the nra's mass mailings, ads and lobbying many schools are showing guns and the constitution, an anti-gun video produced by handgun control inc., whose chairwoman is sarah brady, wife of former white house press secretary james brady, who was disabled by gunfire in the 1981 assassination attempt on then-president reagan. interviewed in his phoenix office as the firestorm was building, a serene deconcini accused the nra of lies and exaggerations about his bill he strongly disputed the nra's claim that a provision banning any gun nearly identical to the nine listed in the measure could be interpreted to cover virtually all semiautomatics. finally, as nra washington lobbyist baker had done in his letter to arizona gun owners, hammer charged that a loosely worded definition in the florida bill would inadvertently ban all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. for the assault-weapons fight, the nra has sent dozens of police officers to washington to offset pro-ban lobbying by police chiefs, launched a national newspaper and tv ad campaign and continued to make available to gun owners a 900 toll phone number that has already produced thousands of nra form letters to president bush and members of congress.
