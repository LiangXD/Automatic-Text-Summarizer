japanese workers at u.s. navy bases are protesting a policy that requires workers who deal with confidential matters to submit to lie-detector tests. the plan neglects our basic human rights, said misao kamiyama, chairman of the all japanese garrison forces labor union, which represents 1,200 workers at the u.s. bases. the union asked the defense facilities administration agency, which hires japanese workers for the bases, to urge the u.s. to drop the polygraph requirement. an agency spokesman said it consented to the u.s. plan but expressed concern about the human-rights standpoint of polygraph tests. since september 1987, the navy has been requiring the polygraph test before it grants limited-access authorization, to personnel, a u.s. military spokesman said. about 500 japanese base workers are subject to the lie-detector test, the spokesman said. mr. kamiyama said transfers of employees who refused to take the tests could fuel anti-american sentiment.
