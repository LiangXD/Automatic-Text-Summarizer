us insurers expect to pay out an estimated dollars 7.3bn (pounds 3.7bn) in florida as a result of hurricane andrew - by far the costliest disaster the industry has ever faced. but on the florida losses alone, hurricane andrew becomes the most costly insured catastrophe in the us. hurricane hugo, which hit the east coast in september 1989, cost the insurance industry about dollars 4.2bn. by contrast, insurance claims resulting from the los angeles riots earlier this year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the us - totalled just dollars 775m. hurricane andrew leaves the us property-casualty insurers facing their worst-ever year for catastrophe losses. with florida's hurricane andrew losses added in, the total rises to dollars 11.2bn. this easily exceeds the record dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in 1989, when the industry paid out on both hurricane hugo and the loma prieta earthquake in california.
