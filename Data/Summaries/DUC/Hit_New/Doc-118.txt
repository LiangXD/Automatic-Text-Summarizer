liz taylor's latest bout with pneumonia has drawn the kind of intense scrutiny normally accorded presidential polyps. but then liz taylor, 58, has always lived a life of extremes. it was partly to still the gossips that taylor's doctors called a press conference wednesday at st. john's hospital and medical center in santa monica. for the tabloid press had been humming with rumors that liz taylor had aids virtually since she was checked into daniel freeman hospital in marina del rey april 9 with a high fever and sinus infection. her addictions have even been linked to a criminal investigation by the los angeles county district attorney's office last week, prosecutors announced that no charges would be filed against taylor's doctors, who had been accused of over-prescribing dependence-forming drugs. taylor, the first celebrity known to enter the betty ford clinic in rancho mirage, made a public example of her willingness to take on her addictions in two heavily publicized stays there. but the betty ford clinic encouraged taylor only to fight the good fights that had brought her there, rather than take on all addictions -- to drugs and food -- at once.
