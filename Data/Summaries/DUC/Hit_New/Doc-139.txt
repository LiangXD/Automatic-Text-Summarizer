that is the vexing question facing mr lewis preston, the former chairman of j p morgan, the new york bank, who takes over as president of the world bank this september. the bank is also under pressure to follow the example of mr jacques attali's european bank for reconstruction and development (ebrd) and attach strict political conditions to its loans. what kind of bank will mr preston inherit from his predecessor, mr barber conable? mr preston's first challenge, says mr mistry, will be to wrest control of the bank from messrs stern and qureshi his second, to prune legions of 'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience. as incoming president, mr preston must review the bank's strategies for promoting development. according to mr lawrence summers, the bank's chief economist, net transfers over the next five years will be about dollars 2 per person in the developing world compared with dollars 9 (in current prices) in the late 1970s. the challenge for mr preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital.
