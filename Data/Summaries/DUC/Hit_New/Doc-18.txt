don jackson, said he set up the self-styled "sting" in long beach to expose alleged police racism in the los angeles area. "i... do not support racism or police brutality, nor do the vast majority of the citizens of long beach, and we're a caring, thinking community and it disturbed us very much to see the tape," he said. "i submit that if mr. jackson had stayed in the vehicle, as did the driver, this incident would not have occurred," hawthorne police chief kenneth r. stonebraker said at a news conference monday. the 30-year-old jackson, who has been on a stress-related disability leave from his hawthorne job for 22 months, contends the incident is typical of a pattern of racism by white officers in the los angeles area. jackson got out after the car stopped and police approached. police booked jackson for investigation of interfering with police and challenging a police officer. jackson said he chose long beach police because of complaints to the police misconduct lawyer's referral service of los angeles.
