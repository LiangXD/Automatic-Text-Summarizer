perez de cuellar, who oversaw the negotiations for the release of western hostages, said in new york that anderson was with syrian officials in lebanon's bekaa valley, and heavy snow has delayed his transfer to damascus. i'm still hopeful it will take place today, he said, referring to anderson's anticipated arrival in damascus and his hand-over to u.s. officials. earlier today, it was not clear where anderson was, despite reports from arab and u.s. officials that he was released and turned over to the syrians. an accompanying five-page arabic-language statement from the islamic jihad group, which has held anderson for 2,455 days, also announced that he would be set free. at the white house, spokesman marlin fitzwater said u.s. officials had no official word that reports of anderson's release were true. we are immensely relieved that terry anderson's 6 1/2-year nightmare is over, said louis d. boccardi, associated press president and chief executive officer, following the initial reports of anderson's release. of these, 11 have been reported or confirmed dead in captivity, 38 not including anderson were released or escaped.
