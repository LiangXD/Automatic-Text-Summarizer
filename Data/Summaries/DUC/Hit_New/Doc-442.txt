this is virtually desert country where a farmer needs several thousand hectares and a drought- and heat-resistant breed of sheep to make a reasonable living. they know him well for not only is he a neighbouring farmer (his farm is just 170 km away by dirt road and that qualifies as 'neighbour' in this vast hot countryside) but he is also south africa's minister of agriculture. mr kraai van niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on continued political reform in south africa, and prieska is the centre of his constituency. mr van niekerk concedes that such suggestions contain an element of truth but the drought is also an established fact and there are socio-economic as well as agricultural reasons why as many farmers as possible should be saved. to allow vast numbers of farms to go out of business at a time when there is little enthusiasm, even among successful farmers for expansion, would put tens of thousands of black farm labourers out of work. but back in the orange free state, last week, farmers were worrying about the continued absence of any rain to provide moisture to germinate wheat seeds when they were due to be planted in a few weeks time. but in the meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the south african budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow.
