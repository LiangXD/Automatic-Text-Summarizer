ljubljana, yugoslavia -- as federal army tanks and jets pounded the breakaway republic of slovenia last week, the pin-striped brokers of the ljubljana stock exchange defied air-raid dangers and gathered in their sixth-floor trading room. their identity is being turned upside down once known as yugoslavia's developed north, slovenia will now be lumped together with western europe's underdeveloped south. almost every country on the continent has its own disenchanted minorities, from the soviet baltics to french corsica, that could be encouraged by the independence declarations of slovenia and the neighboring republic of croatia. joze mencinger, an economist and former finance minister of slovenia, illustrates the republic's economic resilience by noting that while yugoslavia's industrial output fell 18% so far this year, slovenia's declined only 10%. finding new markets in the west is all the more urgent with the certain decline in slovenia's trade with the rest of yugoslavia. a quarter of all goods produced in slovenia are purchased by other yugoslavs, and slovene leaders counted on maintaining these ties even after declaring independence. at the stock exchange, mr. veselinovic frets that his post-independence plans to trade in gold, commodities and foreign currencies are jeopardized by the uncertainty engulfing slovenia.
