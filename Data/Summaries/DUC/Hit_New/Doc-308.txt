the attack on clarence thomas, which boggled tens of millions of viewing americans, makes sense only if one understands that the roots of the struggle extend back to 1980 and ronald reagan's election to the presidency. it won't wait for the next election, nor -- more importantly -- will it make the effort to persuade the electorate to support its views of supreme court nominations. they seemed to be demanding a national referendum on sexual harassment, meaning a senate vote for the accuser, and instead the whole nation showed up and a big majority voted the other way -- to support clarence thomas. now, with clarence thomas heading for the court and the voters going back to their daily lives, what has been learned? as for clarence thomas, we don't agree that he joins the court in a damaged state. but history will note that at the moment clarence thomas was about to be destroyed by the old order, the american people came forward and by the millions confirmed his appointment to the supreme court. it looks to us as if clarence thomas is the first justice to sit on the u.s. supreme court with a popular mandate.
