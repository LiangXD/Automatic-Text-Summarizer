while the views of president bush's first supreme court nominee, david souter, were virtually unknown before his confirmation, the 43-year-old mr. thomas has boldly articulated his vision of constitutional law, both as a judge -- he now sits on the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, the nation's second-highest bench -- and, before that, as chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission for eight years. many of mr. thomas's critics have taken his unconcealed admiration for ronald reagan, his former boss, and robert bork, his predecessor on the d.c. circuit as evidence that mr. thomas shares their philosophy of jurisprudence. writing in the howard law journal in 1987, mr. thomas argued for what he called a natural law or higher law mode of judging, in which the judge examines not only the text of the constitution or statute but also the moral principles underlying the american form of government. mr. thomas is likely to be a very different kind of judge from the man he is replacing. at a conference of black conservatives in san francisco, calif., mr. thomas's eloquent departures from the civil rights orthodoxy on quotas and government handouts greatly impressed the newly installed reagan administration, and in 1981 he was nominated to be assistant secretary for civil rights in the department of education. the reason for the smooth passage, eeoc vice chairman ricky silber man (whose husband laurence silberman sits on the d.c. circuit with mr. thomas and is his closest friend on the bench) thinks, is that clarence has an amazing ability to neutralize opposition. while at the eeoc, mr. thomas gave speeches accusing the republican party of blatant indifference toward black voters, and chastised ronald reagan in particular for letting bob jones university get away with racial discrimination, and for foot dragging on the voting rights act extension.
