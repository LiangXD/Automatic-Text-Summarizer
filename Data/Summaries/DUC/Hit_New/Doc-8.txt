maff scientists concluded that bse had appeared in cattle given processed feed that included remains of diseased sheep. the ministry believes that the reason more cattle have died is that farmers or food renderers kept using infected feed after the ban. last week, maff said that the numbers of confirmed bse cases in the first two months of this year showed a 20 per cent drop over the same period in 1993 -- proof, the ministry says, that the epidemic is waning. some 8,004 cattle have died from bse despite being born after the feed ban was introduced. mark purdey, a somerset farmer and independent researcher, believes that the use of organophosphate pesticides, used from the 1980s as a sheep dip and to treat warble-fly infestation in cattle, could have damaged the animals' immune system, exposing them to the disease. this month 19 cattle have died on farms where maff is conducting a seven-year experiment into the disease. that prospect, discounted by most scientists -- including maff critics such as mr purdey -- is considered a possibility by richard lacey, a leeds university microbiologist who has been studying cases of cjd, a disease with a long incubation period.
