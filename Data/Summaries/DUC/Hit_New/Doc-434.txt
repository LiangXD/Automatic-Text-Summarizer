a los angeles judge friday refused to reduce the $5-million bail for charles h. keating jr., saying the phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations. superior court judge gary klausner said keating -- pursued by creditors, regulators and prosecutors for his role in the failure of irvine-based lincoln savings &amp loan -- has significant reasons not to stay around. at the same time, klausner reduced bail for three keating co-defendants from the $1 million he imposed tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the former operators of american continental corp. and its former main subsidiary, lincoln. ira reiner, whose office has flip-flopped twice in its bail recommendations in the case, praised the decision not to reduce keating's bail. gen. john k. van de kamp to investigate lincoln, said he was willing to let the defendants go without bail on tuesday because he didn't want to face a difficult battle extraditing keating from arizona. while defense attorneys wouldn't say what they thought of the prosecutor's actions, other lawyers connected indirectly to the case scored reiner for allegedly using the case and his changing views on keating's bail to bolster his public image. klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper bail, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing were the most important in this case.
