since slovenia's declaration of independence in june 1991, the gap between the peaceful, ethnically homogeneous new republic of 2m people and the war-impoverished rest of former yugoslavia has widened inexorably. 'slovenia's southern border with croatia has become the border between peace and war in europe,' mr kucan declares. austria is insulated from the war-torn regions of croatia and bosnia-herzegovina, both once ruled by the austrian habs- burgs, thanks to its own 324 km-long border with slovenia. independence has, above all, brought peace to slovenia and left it free to implement the kind of rational market reforms and privatisation policies which remain blocked in the republics absorbed and impoverished by war further south. on the positive side of the balance sheet, however, the end of the federal state means that slovenia no longer has to contribute over dollars 1bn a year to finance the bloated yugoslav army or see its hard currency deposits 'frozen' by the national bank of yugoslavia, as happened before independence. both mr kucan and mr drnovsek, who headed the old revolving yugoslav state presidency for a year before negotiating the exodus of the federal army from slovenia in july 1991, criticise the failure of the west to intervene more forcibly to stop at an early stage what mr kucan calls 'the war of aggression waged by serbia.' preventing the war in parts of former yugoslavia destabilising slovenia and scaring off tourists remains a top priority for the new republic.
