since congress stopped raising the federal minimum wage in 1981, the u.s. economy has generated nine million new jobs at all salary levels. some of those new jobs wouldn't be there if congress had continued to dictate a minimum level of wages. yet organized labor, which constantly asserts its interest in job creation, has made a strong pitch for the kennedy-hawkins minimum wage restoration act, a bill that would head the minimum wage upward once more. worst news of all, labor secretary william brock appears ready to compromise away president reagan's soundly based opposition to the minimum wage. in reality, a minimum wage prices the weakest members of the work force out of jobs. at any rate, a study commission appointed by jimmy carter estimated in a 1981 report that every 10% increase in the minimum wage cost the economy 80,000 to 200,000 entry-level jobs. kennedy-hawkins proposes raising the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1990 from today's $3.35, and, more damaging, tying the minimum wage in future to the average wage for all non-supervisory private employees.
