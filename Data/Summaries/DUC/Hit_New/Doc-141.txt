third world countries led by brazil, the world's most indebted developing nation, blamed the industrialized nations in part monday for perpetuating their poverty. foreign minister roberto de abreau sodre of brazil told the opening session of the 42nd general assembly that the third world economic picture was dimming "due to the lack of progress in international economic relations." a similar theme sounded monday in west berlin, where finance ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded "more forceful action" to help third world countries repay $1.2 trillion in debts. brazil, with $121 billion in foreign loans, has been among the strongest third world lobbyists for debt restructuring and writeoffs. it is critical of the u.s. view that strong economic performance in developed countries would trickle down to help the third world. she urged other industrialized nations to increase financial aid, saying development and debt are related third world crises. "the industrialized countries of the north must now demonstrate that they see the poverty of the third world as their common challenge," she said.
