the chairman of the house agriculture committee says hearings are planned next year into how the u.s. forest service handled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the west, including one-third of yellowstone national park. the hearings will focus on fire fighting policies, rehabilitation of charred areas and on scientific research being done on the summer fires, said a subcommittee staff member. de la garza says the committee also plans dozens of hearings nationwide in preparation for the 1990 farm bill and will look at the u.s. department of agriculture's response to this year's drought-relief legislation. de la garza said he hopes the house interior committee, which has jurisdiction over the national park service, and the agriculture subcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the u.s. forest service, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, the worst in a century. the u.s. forest service said 5 million acres were charred in the raging blazes, including 706,000 acres in yellowstone. the forest and national park service spent a combined $300 million fighting the summer fires, the forest service said. drought conditions, high winds and a "tremendous build-up" of tinder, in yellowstone in particular, helped make the 1988 fires the worst in a hundred years, officials said.
