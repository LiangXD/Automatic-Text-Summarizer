prolonged drought, bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and killing brush and trees that surround many southern california neighborhoods, creating the potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades, fire officials warned monday. in foothill districts closer to los angeles, a fungus that preys upon drought-weakened brush has killed as much as 60% of the chaparral in some portions of the santa monica and san gabriel mountains. scott franklin, a vegetation management officer with the county fire department, said the dead trees and dry brush combine to form a fuel source so volatile that any ignition now could become a major fire. the county fire department map shows that the most threatened residential areas include a number of hillside and canyon communities within the city of los angeles, including parts of baldwin hills, hollywood, the los feliz district, tarzana, encino, sherman oaks, sunland and sylmar. doug allen, a fire prevention officer with the state division of forestry, said residents should clear tall grass, brush, trash, firewood and other combustibles at least 30 feet from any building. what you can do fire officials have a number of recommendations for residents of areas where the wildfire danger is high: clear brush and grass a minimum of 30 feet away from any buildings. do not drive motor vehicles in off-road areas where brush and grass grow.
