las vegas, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and swingers in recent years, is ready for the southern baptists. las vegas is one of only 15 u.s. cities that can provide the hotel rooms and exhibit space for a southern baptist convention, said alvin c. shackleford, a convention spokesman. six years after the denomination voted to meet in las vegas, the decision still evokes controversy, and many southern baptists have decided to stay home. southern baptists leaders say las vegas offers an opportunity to put aside internal battles and emphasize evangelism. "the choice of las vegas was deliberate in that the southern baptist convention hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in las vegas," said stan hastey, executive director of the southern baptist alliance, a moderate group. a series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign saturday in which about 2,000 southern baptists were expected knock on doors around las vegas. las vegas officials and some church leaders say the city variously known over the years as sin city, sin city west and lost wages is undeserving of special attention.
