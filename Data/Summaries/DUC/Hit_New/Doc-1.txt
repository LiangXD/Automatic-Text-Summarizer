"mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. the suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement. because of the disease, the u.s. department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from great britain in july, said margaret webb, a usda spokeswoman in washington. david maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of "bse hysteria" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is "remote." the report said the disease was impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it did not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies. according to a report in the british medical journal, the incidence of creutzfeldt-jakob disease is no higher in britain than it is in countries free of scrapie. the committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that bse was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.
