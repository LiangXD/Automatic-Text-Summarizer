the senate today confirmed conservative civil rights official clarence thomas as a federal appeals judge, brushing aside complaints about his record from some liberal and senior citizens groups. it became clear monday night that thomas' critics had failed to muster enough support to defeat his nomination. "i am prepared to concede that mr. thomas is going to be confirmed," said sen. david pryor, d-ark., chairman of the senate special committee on aging, who complained that the statute of limitations on 15,000 age-discrimination cases before the eeoc ran out without any action being taken while thomas was in charge. pryor said, however, that thomas was virtually guaranteed to win confirmation and added that he wished the nominee well in his new post. danforth, thomas' chief senate supporter and former employer, said he could vouch for the nominee's abilities as a lawyer. "they wasted a lot of time trying to nail clarence thomas," he said.
