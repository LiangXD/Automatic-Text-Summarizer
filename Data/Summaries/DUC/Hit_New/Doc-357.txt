late last night it was reported that iraq's u.n. mission had sent a letter to the u.n. accepting all the security council resolutions on the gulf war. and america's longtime adversary, iran, now might step into a power vacuum, agitating for the departure of western forces, opposing saudi oil policies favorable to the west, and spreading its brand of shiite fundamentalism into a weakened iraq. that battle raged just inside iraq to the north of kuwait, where a broad sweeping maneuver by u.s., french and british forces trapped the premier iraqi force. in a statement read on baghdad radio, iraq finally agreed to president bush's demand not only to withdraw from kuwait, but also to accept u.n. security council resolutions that require baghdad to drop its claim to kuwait and that make iraq liable for paying war reparations. u.s. commanders yesterday conceded that iraq went into the war with far more mobile scud launchers than u.s. intelligence had estimated. so mr. assad is gambling that he will be able to use the iraqi defeat to enhance his own strength in the region and secure his control over lebanon while the u.s. and other western countries keep silent in appreciation for his help in the gulf. mr. bush and other officials were miffed that so little appreciation was expressed for u.s. efforts to eliminate the iraqi military threat.
