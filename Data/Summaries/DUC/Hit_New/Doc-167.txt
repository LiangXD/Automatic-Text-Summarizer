exxon crews tuesday finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker exxon valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of the nation's worst-ever oil spill. another 42 million gallons of oily waste water remained aboard the valdez, which spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude into prince william sound when it struck a reef march 24. canadian authorities also asked exxon for assurances there will be no damage to the british columbia coast if the tanker is towed to oregon, and the mayor of valdez said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude. of about three dozen oil-soaked otters rescued following the spill, about one-third have died, alaska department of fish and game spokesman jon lyman said. an effort at sawmill bay, 11 miles west of valdez, to keep oil away from a hatchery where 2 million salmon are waiting to be released to the sea appeared to be failing. frank murkowski, a champion of oil exploration in alaska, asked that plans for drilling in bristol bay, the state's richest fishing grounds, be set aside until the industry can demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills. at the first valdez city council meeting since the spill, two council members and mayor john devens expressed concern that anger and frustration over the spill was surfacing as harrassment of pipeline company workers and their children.
