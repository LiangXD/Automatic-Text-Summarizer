antarctica, the last place on earth where nature reigns over man, is facing a showdown between those who want to tap its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched under ice. although 16 nations fly flags in antarctica, and seven claim slices of it, no one holds title. france, echoing australia's concerns, wants antarctica to be an unspoiled world park. proponents say a world short of resources has no choice. antarctica is 98 percent under ice, but it is no more a white continent than africa is a dark one. as the sun shifts its angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond, antarctica is aglow in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas. for 10 years, scientists there have measured the earth's thinning ozone layer, letting through radiation that risks catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels.
