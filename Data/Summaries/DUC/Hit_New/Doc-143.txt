bank of boston corp.'s decision to treat its third world loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions, bankers and analysts say. on the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as bank of boston decided monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible. it's a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out, says lawrence cohn, an analyst at merrill lynch &amp co. the bank of boston decision may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks, adds james j. mcdermott, jr., director of research at keefe bruyette &amp woods inc., a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks. actions such as that taken by bank of boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money-center banks. for instance, if manufacturers hanover corp. imitated bank of boston's action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, keefe bruyette estimates. in order to take steps similar to bank of boston's, large money-center banks would have to sell assets, shrink balance sheets and slash dividends -- and they show little sign of doing that. bank of boston announced monday that it was writing off $200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the third world on a non-accrual basis.
