a french dc-10 jetliner with 171 people aboard experienced a powerful high-altitude explosion, possibly from a terrorist bomb, before crashing in a remote desert region of niger in northern africa, officials in france said wednesday. in washington, intelligence specialists said they believe that the jetliner may have been bombed by people seeking to retaliate against france for its recent actions in lebanon. on wednesday, michel friess, a spokesman for uta, said that the wide surface over which the debris of the airplane has been found suggests a high-altitude explosion that leads one to think of a criminal attack. a more likely possibility, speculated terrorist experts and one intelligence source in washington, was a terrorist attack on behalf of pro-syrian muslim forces in lebanon. in santa monica, a rand corp. analyst, bruce hoffman, said wednesday he believed the attack was probably staged by shiite muslim groups concerned that france might intervene in lebanon on behalf of the maronite christians led by aoun. while france's willingness to bargain with terrorists for the freedom of hostages had in the past created a modus vivendi that appeared to spare the country from violent attacks, hoffman and other analysts suggested that the stakes in lebanon had become too important for those old rules to apply. the ambassador's wife, who was born in los angeles in the 1920s and later moved to the imperial valley, had decided to travel ahead of her husband to help plan the october wedding of their 26-year-old daughter anne in suburban washington, d.c. another passenger aboard the plane was chadian planning minister mahamat soumaila, en route to washington to attend a meeting of the international monetary fund.
