rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of gdp across the oecd between 1989 and 1992. total government spending in the oecd countries has risen from 28.1 per cent of gdp in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990. rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families. although there are considerable differences between national health systems, healthcare reforms in countries such as the uk and the netherlands are increasingly converging on models that use competition and price incentives to control costs. an alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in borrowing to fund the welfare state. average government debt in oecd countries has risen from 23 per cent of gdp in 1979 to 44 per cent in 1992. without either tax rises or cuts in welfare budgets, current welfare spending plans could increase debt ratios on average by 90 percentage points over the next 40 years, according to one oecd study.
