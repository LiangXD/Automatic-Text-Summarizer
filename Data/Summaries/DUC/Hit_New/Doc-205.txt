we only hear of other machines, such as a giant pump in a 230-foot shaft that sucks the spoil slurry out of the tunnel, but we get some more big figures for the notebooks: two thousand tons of spoil come out every hour 500 tons of material go in money, the press here reports, is being spent at a rate of $4.4 million a day. the 1986 treaty, which contains a clause prohibiting government subsidies for the tunnel, gave a 55-year concession to eurotunnel, an anglo-french partnership that commissioned trans manche link, a consortium of five english contractors (costain, wimpey, taylor woodrow, balfour beatty and tarmac) and five french (boygues, dumez, societe generale d'entreprise, societe auxiliaire d'entreprises, spie batignolles) to design and build the tunnel. the original forecast for the whole project was $8.5 billion to the chagrin of the 206 banks involved, it now has reached $13.3 billion and many people estimate tunnel costs of $17.5 billion before we see the light at the end. nineteen ninety-two may mean an end to duty-free goods, but the tunnel will be more than a symbol of european unity it will, transport analysts say, reinforce historically dominant trading links in the london-frankfurt-milan so-called golden triangle, bolstering northern europe as an economic entity at a time when its pre-eminence is being challenged by a strengthened mediterranean sunbelt, stretching from barcelona to trieste, and by new opportunities to the east. for mrs. thatcher, in her way a choreographer or a sculptor, the monument may be seen in terms of negative space: the tunnel is perhaps her final proof that britain's victorian glory can be recaptured without spending a penny of public money. in the same week that the french government revealed its plans to spend 190 billion francs ($34 billion) on expanding its high-speed rail network, the prime minister announced that there will be no government subsidy for a fast train between london and the tunnel, in effect shelving plans for a much discussed new 70-mile link between london and folkestone. despite the gift packs of french and english wine (more unfavorable comparisons) on sale just beneath the i dig the tunnel stickers at the eurotunnel exhibition centre, most britons seem to share, or will have to learn to live in regretful memory of, gladstone's view that england should be happy that the wise dispensation of providence has cut her off by that streak of silver sea... partly from dangers, absolutely from the temptations which attend upon the local neighbourhood of the continental nations.
