but it has offended some, especially in arab countries, who now believe that mr. bush's real objectives are the demise of saddam hussein and the destruction of the iraqi military, not just the liberation of kuwait. u.s. and kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from kuwait city are being rounded up and held by iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over. president bush's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton iraqi destruction inside kuwait. mr. bush and his aides were leaning toward a military conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of iraqi atrocities in kuwait came to light. if the allies succeed, saddam hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year-long war against iran and then into a humiliating war against the u.s. and the allies to defend his conquest of kuwait, leaving much of his country's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins. meanwhile, the u.s. hopes, economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until iraq pays war reparations to kuwait to cover war damages. the american hope is that someone from within iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push saddam hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster.
