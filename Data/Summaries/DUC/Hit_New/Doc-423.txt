las vegas -- that paradigm of american excess and decadence -- has discovered asia. stung by seesawing oil prices, competition from atlantic city, n.j., and a moribund u.s. economy, las vegas has turned its attention toward japan, hong kong, taiwan and other booming asian countries in search of gamblers. the largest casinos, such as caesars palace and the mirage, have opened year-round marketing offices in the far east, and most have introduced asian games into their repertoire, such as pai gow and sic bo. old-timers around glitter gulch say the importance of the asian gambler to las vegas has been mounting for the past two decades. in the last five years, casinos have begun scurrying to outdo each other with ever more opulent asian parties, asian gaming areas and asian restaurants. las vegas also exerts a powerful allure for asian visitors from the gray industrial centers of the far east, who are fascinated by not only the gambling (illegal in most of asia) but also the excessive vision of opulence that pervades the city. the increasing flow of asian tourists has transformed not just the casinos, but las vegas as well.
