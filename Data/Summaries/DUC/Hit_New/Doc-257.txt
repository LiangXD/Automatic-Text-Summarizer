the associated press went back to track where the $3.9 billion went and found the money spread far beyond the drought. </text> <byline>by scott mccartney</byline> <byline>and fred bayles</byline> <byline>associated press writers</byline> <text> the record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell, became much more _ an unexpected, election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks. an associated press study conducted over seven months found the drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from hail-damaged kiwi fruit in california to heat-stressed radicchio in massachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in new jersey and washed-out bird seed in colorado. in the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed good crops at higher prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas, including parts of california, arizona, new mexico, texas, oklahoma, maryland and new jersey. "some farmers just got grandfathered in, that's true," said dan shaw, deputy administrator of the agricultural stabilization and conservation service, which administers payment programs for the agriculture department. despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought. in north dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an estimated $1.1 billion to the drought, but direct federal aid cut that by 36 percent, to $706 million. because much of the ascs paperwork never leaves the counties, reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific farmers, also available under the foia.
