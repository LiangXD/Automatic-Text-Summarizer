1. abandoning his from politics to politics stance, which is that politics is self-justifying and self-sufficient, patten has now woven politics into the lives of the people of hong kong, making it part and parcel of the local way of life and inseparable from the war on corruption, the rule of law, freedom, education, and the quality of governance -- all perennial concerns in chinese society. [passage omitted] now patten takes life in hong kong as his point of departure, arguing that democratic politics of a high quality are what the people of hong kong need to maintain the hong kong system. now that patten has made politics an integral part of the life of the hong kong people and their institutions, can the chinese continue to counter it with the argument that it is all a matter of trust between nations? 3. patten's second annual report to the legislative council is replete with praises for the people of hong kong, for their accomplishments, and for the superiority of the hong kong system, calling it a miracle of human society. if, on the other hand, it echoes patten and begins heaping praises on hong kong and emulating the hong kong system, can the chinese government bring itself to do that? patten makes endless allusions to what is good about the hong kong system and what is bad about the chinese system, one obvious example being the way the two governments level with the people. even more striking is the open dialogue and debate that took place in an atmosphere of freedom between patten and the people of hong kong on an equal plane after the governor presented his second annual report (in which the chinese authorities also played an active part).
