joseph mcnamara, retired chief of san jose's department and now a fellow at stanford university's hoover institution, said he has been getting calls all summer from cities around the country about racism and brutality in their departments. the king beating led to an investigation of the police department by an independent commission that found racism, brutality, inadequate discipline, mismanagement and a siege mentality pitting officers against the community. the christopher commission's scathing report made more than 100 recommendations, many of them aimed at moving away from the department's hard-nosed approach and improving relations with residents. but block has dug in his heels, insisting a panel he appointed is independent enough to advise which christopher commission recommendations might apply to his department. the sheriff has said that his department continually re-examines itself and launched several christopher commission recommendations before the commission even existed -- but that it can't do everything. 'a last-resort mechanism' law enforcement, and i'm going beyond the sheriff's department, did not create the social conditions out there from which the violence is springing, he said. on the county side, critics say block's position as an elected official insulates him from the kind of independent review the city was able to order for the police department.
