one crew member gushed about a future when humans will become custodians of our world. today we gather at a new instrument... to explore the mysteries of our very own home planet, bass said, as the crew members, wearing futuristic black uniforms, fought to contain their emotions. crew member abigail alling, 31, her voice quavering, evoked the sometimes mystical bent of biosphere 2's organizers: by necessity, we biospherians walk in as custodians of our world and bring past and future together. at 8:18 a.m., the four men and four women of the crew exchanged quick hugs and kisses with relatives and project officials, stepped through an air-lock door, waved through the round window, and disappeared inside the 3.15-acre geodesic-framed compound. the 45-minute closing ceremony after dawn today included prayers from a tibetan monk and a sun dance by dan old elk, a sioux from montana who presented each crew member with a braided sprig of sweet grass from canada. each crew member is likely to spend about four hours daily on farming and other chores to maintain the complicated machinery driving the biosphere. but margret augustine, president and chief executive officer of the project, said problems could crop up after a month or so that would require the crew to leave temporarily before returning for a solid two years.
