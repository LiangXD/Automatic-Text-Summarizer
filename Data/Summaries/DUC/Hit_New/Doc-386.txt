trying to save her name charles ogletree, a harvard law professor and one of hill's lawyers, said hill wanted to take the test to refute the attacks made on her motives and integrity by republican senators saturday. however, the significance of polygraph tests is limited. the danger of polygraph tests is that some people are able to fool lie detectors because they believe what they're saying, even though it isn't true, georgetown university criminal law professor paul rothstein said. what hill was asked minor, a well known polygraph expert who has taught fbi polygraph operators, said he put four questions to hill: (check) have you deliberately lied to me about clarence thomas? howard metzenbaum asked that hill's polygraph results be placed in the committee record, but chairman joseph biden, d-del., refused, noting that courts did not accept such evidence and that the test had been produced outside committee control. nevertheless, rothstein said, polygraphs are 60 to 80 percent reliable, depending upon whom you ask, and peter tague, also a georgetown criminal law specialist, said that prof. hill's willingness to take a polygraph test tends to support her credibility. in july 1980, minor, who was then with the fbi, administered two polygraph tests to herman sillas, then the u.s. attorney in sacramento, to determine the veracity of allegations that he had taken a $7,500 bribe from a prison inmate several years earlier.
