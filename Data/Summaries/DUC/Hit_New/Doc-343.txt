the trans-antarctica expedition mr. steger writes about in crossing antarctica (knopf, 304 pages, $25) was born of the ambitions of mr. steger and jean-louis etienne, who met in 1986 in the middle of separate arctic journeys. mr. steger was leading the first confirmed unsupported dog-sled expedition to the north pole and dr. etienne was making the first solo ski there. none of that bothered mr. steger, who was more interested in mr. qin's fierce determination to share camp chores and pull his weight in subzero cold. dahe will do well, mr. steger decided, a judgment vindicated over 3,741 miles in windchills sometimes approaching minus 100 degrees fahrenheit. mr. steger is also a keen judge of dogs, who share equally in the credit for trans-antarctica. mr. steger is a leader of a different stripe: experienced, laid back, determined and flexible. as polar literature, mr. steger's account, written with jon bowermaster, cannot equal the technical fascination of amundsen's the south pole.
