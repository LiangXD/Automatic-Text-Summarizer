the white house yesterday disclosed that kuwait's ousted government has formally asked the u.s. to enforce the total trade embargo the united nations has imposed on iraq, allowing the u.s. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying iraqi goods. other bush administration officials said that the international naval force in the area -- consisting of american, british, french, canadian, soviet, german and australian ships -- may be used both to stop oil exports from leaving iraq and kuwait and to stop shipments of food and other goods from going in. the naval interdiction force is part of an overall american strategy that officials say is designed to leave the iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation. iraq's third attack option would be to start an undeclared war on the u.s. and other western nations through terrorism. if iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition, the bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the american public and the west in general, and could open the possibility that moderate arabs -- even including saudi arabia -- might drop out of the effort against iraq and accept some deal from saddam hussein. the unpredictability of iraq's leader is a principal reason the u.s. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around saudi arabia. and the u.s. is taking similar steps to ensure that its naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of iraq and support a war if necessary.
