the major earthquake that struck the san francisco bay area tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in northern california. a 1988 report by the u.s. geological survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the southern santa cruz mountains. the high probability is based on several factors, including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said clarence allen, professor of geology and geophysics at the california institue of technology in pasadena. it just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area," allen said. he noted that the 1988 report, titled "probabilities of large earthquakes occurring in california on the san andreas fault," presented information that was already widely known among scientists. in some areas of southern california, there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring. the highest, the usgs says, is in the central california town of parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.
