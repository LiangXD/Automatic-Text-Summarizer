mr daley accepted the nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet position and turning down an offer to be mr clinton's chief negotiator at the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva. however, mr daley's appointment to chair the white house's task force on the north america free trade agreement is not a cosy political payoff. mr daley was chosen for the job, chicago observers say, because he has proven he can sway votes and is willing to take the risk of losing a controversial battle. by rough count, mr daley will have to marshall 73 votes from democratic representatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement: those along the border with mexico and those with big agricultural, consumer product, or manufacturing export interests. mr daley has taken four months out from his chicago law firm to lead the nafta push. mr clinton may be banking on mr daley's union ties to help the nafta effort. however, mr daley, by pushing nafta, runs the risk of alienating his union supporters.
