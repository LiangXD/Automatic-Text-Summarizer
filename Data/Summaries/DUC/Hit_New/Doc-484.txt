"my guess would be that they would probably have somewhat fewer problems than you would normally encounter in the classical isolation experience," said mary connors, a psychologist and division staff member at the national aeronautics and space administration's ames research center near sunnyvale, calif., who until recently was acting chief of its crew research and space human factors branch. experiments in long-term situations where small groups of people live in harsh climatic or environmental extremes, such as the in antarctica or underwater, usually are viewed in terms of "isolation, confinement, deprivation and risk," connors said. but crew members will be allowed to leave through air locks if health or extreme family emergencies necessitate, eliminating the sense of risk, she said. connors and bechtel said the strong job focus, cross-work training and the fact that the potential crew members have worked and spent significant time together all are highly advantageous. creativity, spontaneity, withdrawal, unexpected irritability, eating patterns and general health will be watched, but the best sensors likely will be the crew members themselves. "mine has always been that it's unlikely, because i think people tend to act as crews when they get in an experience that is prolonged," connors said. he and connors also said most studies of crews, including mixed-sex groups in environments far harsher and smaller than the biospherians are likely to encounter, have shown them to be highly motivated, energetic and willing to put up with almost anything for the sake of the project and the team's success.
