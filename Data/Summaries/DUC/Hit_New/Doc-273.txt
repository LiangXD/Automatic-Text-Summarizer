term limits for congress have been supported by some of history's most prominent democrats. among democratic party activists, james calaway of texas is typical of those who now favor term limits. he says term limits would mean we're governed by citizens who go home after their service and not permanent, elitist people who never leave office. while speaker tom foley reacts to term limits the way that linus in the comic strip peanuts would if his security blanket were taken away, some house democrats think his concern that term limits would result in large gop gains in congress is a fantasy. people who say term limits are a republican plot to oust incumbents should know that a majority of open seats are won by democrats, says rep. indeed, the democratic party could actually be helped by term limits, according to former oklahoma state legislator cleta mitchell, a self-described liberal feminist who works with the denver-based term limit group americans back in charge. but there are already signs that business lobbies, labor unions and other term limit opponents are relying more on convincing judges -- starting with florida's heavily politicized state supreme court -- to overturn state term limits than on trying to convince voters to reject the idea.
