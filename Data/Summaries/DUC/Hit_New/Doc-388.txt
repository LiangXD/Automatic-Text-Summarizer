the uss vincennes' destruction of an iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake organization said sunday. "on the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the captain acted the best way he knew how," said william e. brooks jr., publisher of the vincennes sun-commercial newspaper and a member of the uss vincennes association. the current uss vincennes is the fourth naval vessel to bear the name of this southwestern indiana city. "if the captain had stayed there and not done anything, we might have been reading about loss of life on the vincennes," brroks said. association member gene thurmond, 65, of evansville, served on the second uss vincennes, a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and sunk by japanese cruisers in 1942. thurmond said he met the captain of the newest ship, capt. the association's 500 members meet annually in vincennes to reminisce about their years of service and pay tribute to the dead, said vincennes liaison officer and honorary member, bill toth, 64.
