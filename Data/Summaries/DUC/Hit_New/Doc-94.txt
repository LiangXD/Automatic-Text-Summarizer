but the senate already has voted to force the census bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment. the census bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the immigration and naturalization service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in california. they fear that any attempt to ascertain the legal status of respondents will exacerbate difficulties the census bureau already faces in accurately counting hispanics and blacks. as it is, the census bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential, mr. vargas says. if the census bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder. although the 106 million census forms can be reprinted if congress acts soon, wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge, mr. bonpanne says. those in congress and at the census bureau who favor continuing the practice of counting all residents of the u.s. conclude that this language unambiguously resolves the debate.
