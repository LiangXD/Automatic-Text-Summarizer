the report in tomorrow's british medical journal may well have an emotional impact on some people who are vacillating about quitting smoking and for one reason or another have a fear of leukemia, suggested nicholas wald, an epidemiologist at the medical college of st. bartholomew's hospital here. the balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia, dr. wald wrote in an accompanying commentary on the analysis, which was conducted by university of edinburgh epidemiologist leo kinlen. dr. kinlen, who directs the university's cancer epidemiology unit, examined leukemia deaths from a u.s. study that had tracked veterans' smoking between 1954 and 1969. dr. kinlen found veterans who had smoked more than 21 cigarettes a day were the most likely to die from myeloid leukemia, the most common form of the disease in middle-aged people. these heavy smokers had a 93% greater chance of developing fatal leukemia than the veterans who never had smoked. for this reason, leukemia has in general not been regarded as a a malignancy related to smoking, dr. kinlen wrote. if the link is causal, an editorial in the medical journal said, then smoking is a more important cause of leukemia in adults than all other known causes combined.
