'mr patten is the governor and the representative of the hong kong british government,' says one senior chinese official in hong kong. some concrete evidence of this new realism is the agreement beijing reached last month with britain on the funding for hong kong's hkdollars 160bn (pounds 13bn) airport development. after the dispute on electoral reform, beijing announced that it would dismiss the 1995 legco once china resumed sovereignty of hong kong, and replace it with a provisional legislature. mr patten is adamant that he is not leaving hong kong until he has discharged his duty. china's supporters in the colony claim that mr patten's policy is now to make hong kong harder to govern by 'loosening the screws' before the british leave. mr zhou nan, the most senior representative of the chinese communist party and government in hong kong, recently attacked mr patten's plans for a government-funded pension, saying: 'during the transition period, we should not casually transplant a costly euro-socialist pay-as-you-go concept to hong kong without prudently taking into consideration similar western programmes' long-standing track record of grossly under-estimating liabilities and grossly over-estimating funding projections.' mr patten claims that by 1997 public spending in hong kong as a percentage of gdp will be lower than it was in 1982 - the year britain began handover negotiations with china.
