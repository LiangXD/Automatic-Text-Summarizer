earlier friday 13 people were arrested when police dispersed a crowd of about 100 gathered for a pro-serbian rally in ljubljana that had been prohibited by slovenian authorities. slovenia issued an order tuesday banning the rally and serbia reacted by severing relations with slovenia. in its statement, slovenia's collective presidency called serbia's action "a flagrant violation of all constitutional, legal and civilized norms." aleksandar prlja, serbia's secretary for foreign affairs, told the associated press that slovenia's "banning of the peaceful rally was deeply humiliating for the serbian people. slovenian officials said the rally had been organized by serbian politicians trying to oust the slovenian leadership. economic decline has brought increased friction between the republics with their different ethnic populations, and the slovenian serbian conflict also involves liberal vs. conservative communist leaders. it called serbia's imposition of an economic boycott a "declaration of war" and said slovenia would respond by "opening itself to the world, introducing greater democracy and by holding free elections."
