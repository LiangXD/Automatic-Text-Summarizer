but the rise and fall of sherman adams, president eisenhower's powerful chief-of-staff, is more than an interesting political doppleganger to the travails of his lineal heir, john sununu. the case of sherman adams sheds an eerie light on sununu's rise in the ancient, stony soil of new hampshire politics. that sherman adams, the first assistant president and john sununu, conceivably the last of the imperial chiefs of staff, were both catapulted from governor of the granite state into national prominence is not at all coincidental. when he took office, adams began a program of streamlining and reducing state government that provided a model followed three decades later for another new new hampshire governor, john sununu. unlike sherman adams, john sununu could not be mistaken for a rock-ribbed granite stater. more or less the same thing could have been said about sherman adams when he gave up the new hampshire governorship to become dwight eisenhower's assistant president in 1953. today, as vice president dan quayle could tell you, john sununu is no sherman adams.
