that is why the american diabetes assn. and other health education groups in the los angeles area and california have begun a major push to educate latinos about diabetes. like heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among latinos is a condition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors say. latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are anglos, and incidence of the disease increases with age. most commonly in latinos, however, diabetes takes the form called type ii, which first appears in adulthood and often can be controlled with proper diet and exercise. other barriers to latinos getting care for diabetes are more subtle, doctors interested in the issue say. davidson said he is confident that latinos will respond to education efforts on diabetes. diabetes complications according to the american diabetes assn., in the united states every year: * 150,000 people die of diabetes and its complications * 5,000 people go blind because of diabetes * 10% of all cases of kidney disease necessitating dialysis were caused by diabetes * 45% of all non-traumatic amputations of the leg and foot were caused by diabetes * heart disease is 2 to 4 times more likely in people with diabetes
