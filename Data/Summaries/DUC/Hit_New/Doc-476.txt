congress soon will consider an increase in the federal minimum wage to $5.05 from $3.35 an hour. last year alone, nine states and the district of columbia raised their minimum wage above the current federal level, and this year new york, new jersey and pennsylvania are considering doing the same. a minimum wage of $5.05 would require even the high-minimum-wage states of california and connecticut to increase their mandated minimums by 19%. nonetheless, both republican and democrat members of congress from high-wage states will likely find it difficult to vote against raising the federal minimum wage, since raising it would equalize wage costs among states and increase the competitiveness of labor in high-minimum-wage states. typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living. california and massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages. compare these unemployment rates to those of alabama and louisiana, states that have no minimum wage.
