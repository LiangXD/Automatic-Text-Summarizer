they point to glaring failings in the federal government's policing of the 276,000 licensed gun dealers in the us as evidence of the brady bill's likely ineffectiveness. but even the most ardent supporters of the brady bill acknowledge that it will make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year of new or used firearms, let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation and will barely affect the more than 14,000 murders and 1,400 accidental deaths involving guns each year. despite its uncertain effect, passage of the brady bill is read by some as a sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control. paradoxically, while thousands of people have been telephoning their republican senators to demand that they stop blocking the brady bill, thousands have also been flocking to join the national rifle association, the leading organisation among the pro-gun lobbies. in virginia, meanwhile, ms mary sue terry, the democratic candidate for governor, relied in her campaign on gun control and was thrashed by mr george allen, her republican opponent, who did not favour tighter curbs but promised to be tough on criminals by abolishing parole. in the process they have lost touch with many of their members, who back gun control in general and specifically the brady bill. first, left-wing democrats have begun to champion gun control as a supplement to tough anti-crime measures, rather than an alternative they have recaptured much of the 'tough on crime' high ground by backing boot camps for young delinquents, harsher sentences and stiffer restrictions on parole or habeas corpus appeals.
