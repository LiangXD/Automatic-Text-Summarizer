indeed, in a season that holds the promise of high performance levels in general (as athletes peak for the world indoor championships in seville, spain, in march), johnson's return to competition might help rejuvenate a sport in need of public interest. if he's eligible to compete, to me, ben johnson is an attraction, said ray lumpp, meet director for the indoor meet at the meadowlands in east rutherford, n.j.. right now, i can't think of anybody who would arouse as much interest as ben johnson. it would be ironic if johnson becomes the star who revitalizes indoor track and field after being blamed for the steady decline of sponsor interest in outdoor track. some meet directors report concern that longtime sponsors will be reluctant to be associated with a meet that has johnson as its marquee athlete, given johnson's former association with anabolic steroids. the iaaf voted last september to adopt the controversial ben johnson rule allowing the iaaf council to decertify an athlete's records, titles and results if he or she later is shown to have used a banned substance before those performances. the question remains, is ben johnson capable of running at that brilliant level again?
