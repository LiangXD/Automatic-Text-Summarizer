the stripping of ben johnson's olympic gold medal in a drug scandal has wounded canadian pride and shamed a nation hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar wayne gretzky. the spirit of a nation raced with johnson when he won the gold medal in the 100 meters on saturday with a world record time of 9.79 seconds. johnson, a 26-year-old jamaican transplant, waved the canadian flag in triumph and dedicated his gold to his mother and all canadian citizens. johnson's disgrace was heralded in canadian headlines such as "fool's gold," "black day for canada," "seconds of glory, years of shame," "from fame to shame," and "big ben is now has-ben." trent frayne, sports columnist for the globe and mail of toronto, said johnson's victory was the biggest event in canada since a national team beat the soviet union in a seven-game hockey series in 1972. now it has forfeited its only gold medal of the olympics. but columnist gary lautens of the toronto star said the nation should not cover its head in shame.
