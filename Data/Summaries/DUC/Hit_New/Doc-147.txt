with the decline of communism, u.s. development groups believe they are exporting free-market economics to tiny businesses that can fuel growth in the developing world. poverty lending has such promise that multi credit plans to make it the bank's number one activity, ahead of trade financing, consumer loans and merchant loans, the official adds. accion, a cambridge, mass.-based nonprofit international development group and a leader in the u.s. microloan movement, says it plans to increase its microlending this year to $66.5 million from $37.8 million in 1990 and $9.8 million five years ago. accion's ms. romanow says the group, which serves latin america, plans to expand the lending to a total of between $500 million and $1 billion over the next five years. care, new york, perhaps the world's largest private international-development group, says small economic-activity development -- primarily microlending -- is its fastest-growing portfolio. some third world banks, notably in asia, have been making microloans for years. and officials at the u.s. agency for international development, which finances a big chunk of many private groups' overseas operations, say they support the principle of expanding poverty lending but oppose congressional efforts to mandate minimum levels.
