but at a preview-of-coming-attractions press briefing at the annual convention of american booksellers assn. in washington over the weekend, bork -- the target of the first all-out, national political campaign to defeat a supreme court nominee -- insisted that his book was more about the general tendency to run law into politics than about his own particular unhappy experience. his unsuccessful bid for a seat on the nation's highest court forms only a part of his book, bork said. the founders of this nation thought the primary means of assuring our liberty was not the courts, bork said this weekend, but rather the assignment of different functions to different branches of government. whereas the constitution specified that laws were to be made by legislators who were elected by the people, not judges appointed by the president, bork said, a lot of americans now simply assume that the courts should produce results they like rather than sticking to the constitution. on the matter of bork's leanings on possible supreme court action on the abortion issue, i was told by two republican senators that they would vote against me because i might vote to overturn roe against wade, bork said. but this tempting, or political manipulation of the courts, long predated his attempt to secure a seat on the supreme court, bork said. constitutional law, in short, bork said, has come to be seen as a political weapon.
