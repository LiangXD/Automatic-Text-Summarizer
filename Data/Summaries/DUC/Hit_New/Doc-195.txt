less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed colombia to the brink of political chaos. addressing president virgilio barco, the el tiempo editorial said: "in your hands, and only in your hands, is the power to avoid the country's dissolution." "the gravest aspect of colombia's bloodletting is that the government has no idea how to even slow it," said a member of a regional human rights committee based in medellin, the cocaine capital. former president alfonso lopez said the assassinations of three candidates indicated that colombia's armed forces must be reorganized. one of the country's presidential candidates, alvaro gomez, said friday that barco should name a three-man council to run colombia's security forces to avoid a military coup. "never has there been such a great and pathetic image of anarchy," said gomez, a presidential candidate of the conservative party. both barco and his party's presidential candidate, cesar gaviria, have linked colombia's salvation to constitutional reform.
