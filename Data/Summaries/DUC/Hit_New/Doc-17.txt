there are growing signs that hurricane andrew, unwelcome as it was for the devastated inhabitants of florida and louisiana, may in the end do no harm to the re-election campaign of president george bush. in the process, mr bush has been able to call on the power of incumbency, the one asset denied his presidential rival, mr bill clinton, who is to visit florida today. this was brought home graphically by the president's announcement that homestead air force base in florida - a major local employer virtually destroyed by andrew - would be rebuilt. as if to underline the political benefit to the president, a harris poll conducted from august 26 to september 1 yesterday showed mr bush with 45 per cent support - behind mr clinton by just five points - reflecting a closer race than other recent surveys. with mr bush constantly in the headlines, mr clinton has been left on the sidelines, able to do little more than offer sympathy and sotto voce criticism of the president's initial stumbling. first responses were certainly found wanting, specifically in the performance of the federal emergency management agency (fema) set up by president carter in 1979 to handle disasters such as andrew. it was mr baker who reshuffled the president's campaign schedule to make room for visits to the devastated areas and who pushed for a bigger role for the previously obscure mr card.
