the quack therapy being performed on them is the imposition of limits on the number of terms that state lawmakers can serve. 18, when oklahoma voters endorsed overwhelmingly a ballot initiative limiting state lawmakers to 12 years' service. by itself, the term limitation in oklahoma might be written off as a cranky act of vengeance in a state not renowned as a political trend-setter, but similar measures will be voted on in november in california and colorado. the very weakness and vulnerability to corruption that have often plagued state legislatures usually result from the amateurism of lawmakers -- the quality that term-limitation backers now assert as a virtue. where state legislators are underpaid, have no professional staffs and meet rarely, they usually come under the sway of full-time governors, executive-branch bureaucrats and highly paid lobbyists. not every state lawmaker has his eye on a seat in the u.s. senate or house of representatives. but it's a safe bet that more people will be using state seats to groom for higher office if they know that the law will force them out soon.
