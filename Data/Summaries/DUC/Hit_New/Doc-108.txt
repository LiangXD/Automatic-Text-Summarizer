as yellowstone national park's research biologist, he has already begun to monitor the forest's rebirth from the worst fire on record. mr. despain's research should play a major role in a new debate over whether to reforest burnt areas of yellowstone or to let nature take its course. the national park service has already been at the center of a much-publicized political firestorm over its 16-year-old natural burn policy, which allows lightning-caused fires to burn themselves out, except where they threaten towns or park buildings. mr. despain has set up or is planning several long-term research projects to study the effects of this year's fires. the burnt snags, as charred tree trunks are called, creak in the wind above mr. despain and are all that remain of a forest section that sprouted after a fire swept through here about the time of the civil war. aspen trees, whose paper-white bark and yellow leaves punctuate the evergreen forests this time of year, also thrive after a fire. wyoming's u.s. senators, republicans malcolm wallop and alan k. simpson, are mindful of the damage the fires caused the state's tourist industry this year, as well as the threat to gateway towns near the park.
