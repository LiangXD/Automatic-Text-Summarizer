in a blow to california and other states with large immigrant populations, the senate voted friday to bar the census bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count. a senate-house conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped from a $17.4-billion appropriations bill for the state, justice and commerce departments. state officials have said california could lose up to $300 million in federal aid if illegal aliens were uncounted. pete wilson (r-calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx of immigration beyond the legal limits. the senate's action would also have an impact on smaller california cities without substantial latino populations because census population figures play an important role in community development block grant formulas, said don vestal, westminster city planner. westminster is following a recommendation by the census bureau to form a complete count committee of officials and community leaders to help ensure cooperation from all city residents. opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical because the census bureau has already printed questionnaires that do not contain any question about legality of residence.
