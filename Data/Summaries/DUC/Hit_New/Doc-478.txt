president bush today said he could suppport an increased minimum wage but only if congress also established a sub-minimum training wage he said would prevent a loss of jobs. the president's comments came a day after mrs. dole told the senate labor committee that bush's support of legislation to raise the minimum wage would hinge on whether lawmakers included a training wage in the legislation. bush's stand puts him in opposition to the head of the labor committee, edward m. kennedy, who said thursday he remained opposed to a training wage and was confident his bill to raise the minimum hourly wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 would pass this year. bush during the presidential campaign said in one interview that he supported some increase in the minimum wage, provided it was coupled with the training wage, although at other times his campaign said bush was against an increase. mrs. dole, sworn in to her cabinet post four hours before the hearing, was not specific as to how high bush favors raising the minimum wage or what kind of time limit to set on the training wage. in a brief interview after the hearing, kennedy, who introduced his minimum wage bill wednesday, said "my views haven't changed" and that he would try to get the bill through the senate without a provision for a training wage. organized labor supports the increased minimum wage but opposes the training wage, in part because it believes some employers would use the lower wage to cut their costs by hiring people at the training wage and laying off higher-paid workers.
