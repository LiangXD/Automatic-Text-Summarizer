residents of nearby angeles panicked at the roar of the initial blast, and thousands of people packed roads after a huge gray-greenish mushroom cloud burst from the volcano and turned day to night. at a refugee center in olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors told of the sky growing dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed by a rain of ash. tens miles to the east, hundreds of americans fled clark air base, home to 15,000 american military personnel and their families. a photographer who circled the volcano in an airplane said an aerial gunnery range at clark was covered with ash, as were mountains in the zambales range, normally lush, green tropical peaks that now looked like the alps in winter. moments after the first explosion, sirens wailed at clark air base, and 600 of the 1,500 americans remaining there fled eastward to safety. the americans who fled clark with a few belongings on monday moved in with sailors and their families at subic bay naval base, 50 miles to the southwest. although the air force left clark, philippine authorities have not ordered a general evacuation of angeles, a city of more than 300,000 people adjacent to the base.
