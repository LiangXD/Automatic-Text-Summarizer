but at the world bank, mr. conable finds himself under fire. while the debt morass has deepened, mr. conable's world bank has looked inward, shuffling its organization charts around in a disruptive reorganization and then campaigning for a $74.8 billion increase in its capital. as congress considers the increase, liberal critics on capitol hill are demanding that mr. conable show he is ready to use the bank's vast resources to make some direct impact on reducing the huge burden of third world debt. mr. conable subscribes to the baker plan, which stresses new lending by commercial banks and the world bank to debtor countries that adopt growth-oriented, market-based economic reforms. even the world bank's longtime financial wizard, eugene rotberg -- who quit the bank for merrill lynch over mr. conable's reorganization plan -- proposed last month that the world bank guarantee new 20-year commercial-bank loans to third world countries. mr. conable spent roughly a year reorganizing the bank so that project experts and country experts would work more closely. mr. conable contends that the reorganization has helped a great deal in recapturing the support of our member countries, which had refused to approve the bank's budget just before he took office.
