ben johnson spent his homecoming in seclusion, without the olympic gold medal and the hero's welcome, as canadians bemoaned the fate of the sprinter who failed the drug test. "it's not the only thing in life to win a gold medal," johnson said. stripped of the gold and banned for life from canadian teams, johnson cried in the back of a limousine that whisked him to his mother's home in suburban toronto after the grueling trip from seoul. "there's no gold now, just disappointment," said boyd plaxton, 26, of saskatoon, saskatchewan, one of 200 people on hand when johnson's plane landed. "first i was shocked, but after a while, i don't care," johnson said when asked what he felt after he was informed he had failed the drug test. i know it," said his father, ben johnson sr., from falmouth, jamaica, in an interview with the toronto globe and mail. "the last flicker of hope just died," said danny planetta, who was watching tv at a bar when he heard monday night that johnson had tested positive for steroids.
