further study of a newly isolated hormone found in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the most common form of the disease, a scientist says. the research "opens the door to the scientific study of the disease at a level that wasn't possible before and potentially the mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging," he said. cooper, who has been working with scientists at oxford university, described the hormone research this week at the 13th international diabetes federation congress in sydney, australia. in his presentation, cooper said the hormone, dubbed "amylin," was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics. in type ii diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body's insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high. the new work is "a very important finding" if amylin truly blocks insulin and appears in abnormal amounts in diabetics, f. scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks insulin, but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics, said pi-sunyer, director of the endocrinology, diabetes and nutrition division at st. luke's-roosevelt hospital center in new york.
