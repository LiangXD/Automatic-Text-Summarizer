the other members of the team are glaciologist qin dahe of china geoff somers, who has spent 42 months in antarctica with the british antarctic survey and keizo funatsu of japan, a former economist who turned to dog-sledding and adventure. steger, who in the past has picked his own teams, says he is honored that the soviet union and china will be sending official representatives. the ussr also plans to send a military cargo plane to pick up the team from its rendezvous at steger's minnesota camp the u.s. state department, while not officially sanctioning the trek, is expected to let the plane land. "we want the world to know much, much more about antarctica after our expedition than it did before we set out," steger said. planetary warming of just a few degrees could melt the polar ice caps, raising sea level and flooding coastal areas, but steger said it's simplistic to worry about submerged cities. with 85 percent of the planet's fresh water stored in the snow and ice of antarctica, a thaw would reduce the salinity of the oceans, change ocean currents and wreak havoc with weather patterns. these ominous changes are most apparent in antarctica, making it "like a canary in a mine," steger said.
