the earthquake that struck northern iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated soviet armenia in 1988. like thursday's earthquake in iran, the dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in armenia killed about 25,000 people. the armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the richter scale, but thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7 according to the u.s. geological survey. the quake struck an area of iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, needham said. twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in iran during the last 30 years, needham said. a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.
