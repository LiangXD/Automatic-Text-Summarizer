president carlos salinas de gortari has appointed a cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as "the slar eclipse of the century" on july 11. posters have been placed in mexico city subways promoting the event, and resorts along the eclipse's path are scrambling to accommodate the expected rush of tourists. the eclipse path reaches from hawaii through mexico to brazil. baja california sur alone plans to spend $26.5 million for public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in millions more from tourism. it will be the last chance to see a total solar eclipse this century. cuernavaca, 35 miles south of mexico city, is hosting a geophysicists' congress during the week of the eclipse. the national university is developing six half-hour documentaries on eclipses and 10 tv spots on the dangers of looking at the sun, astronomy professor jesus galindo says.
