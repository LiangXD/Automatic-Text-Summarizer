sununu created an appearance problem by using a government car to travel to a new york stamp show, bush said, but given the circumstances, i think it was appropriate. sources said tuesday that an angry bush contacted a senior political adviser sunday to discuss how to handle the controversy after learning of sununu's decision to have a government car and driver take him to new york last wednesday. it was sununu's first appearance on a network program since revelations in april about his extensive use of government planes for activities ranging from visiting his dentist to skiing to trips to his home state of new hampshire. on sunday, sununu gave the same explanation for using the government car that he had offered for using government planes -- that he must be able to communicate instantly with the white house in the interest of national security. sununu has been unable to fly on government planes for personal business since bush instituted new travel rules after the april controversy. the car controversy has created new ripples among republicans who question whether sununu recognizes that repeated questions about his ethics reflect poorly on bush, who vowed during his campaign to bring a higher ethical standard to his administration and fight even the appearance of impropriety among aides. party officials in three states where sununu has made recent appearances said they, not the white house, asked corporations to provide him planes.
