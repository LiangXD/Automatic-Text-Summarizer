florida's attorney general has asked its state supreme court for an advisory opinion on a term-limit initiative that would limit the state's members of congress to eight consecutive years in office. three u.s. house members, led by democrat larry smith, have filed briefs asking the court to rule state term limits unconstitutional. the court said the state's strong interests in protecting against an entrenched, dynastic legislative bureaucracy outweighed objections that term limits restrict voter choice at the ballot box. but the court's decision affected only term limits on state officials federal officeholders weren't included in california's limits. fashing, the u.s. supreme court determined that a particular candidate has no fundamental right to ballot access or to run for office. the supreme court has long held that the power to ensure a fair electoral system, truly responsive representation in congress and a high degree of citizen participation in elections rests with the states. should the court rule against term limits by the states, numerous other ballot access restrictions will likely be passed that have many of the same effects as term limits.
