three generations of imbeciles are enough, holmes had written, in what judge bork described, in charitable understatement, as not (holmes's) finest hour. judge bork isn't justice holmes, though he is probably one of the half-dozen best qualified supreme court nominees since holmes. the same ads implied that judge bork had no objection to sterilizing workers, didn't believe in any right to privacy, and just might turn the clock back on civil rights? judge bork had to explain that, yes, there are all kinds of privacy rights in the constitution (the first, 4th and 5th amendments, for example), but he didn't believe there is any generalized, undefined right. isn't judge bork in effect a racist because he once opposed that part of the civil rights act of 1964 that outlawed discrimination in public places? implied sen. judge bork explained that he was concerned at the time about government coercion in private decisions, but that he had retracted that position more than a decade ago. if judge bork is not confirmed, however, the record of this week suggests that the reason will result less from his own failings than from the ferocity and distortions of his opponents.
