solar eclipses occur twice a year, when the sun, moon and earth line up. but when the shadow's narrow path does cross inhabited areas, people flock there to experience totality -- to watch the light snap off and the stars snap on, and to gaze at the sun's shaggy corona hanging in the dark sky for a few minutes before daylight abruptly returns. also, its 150-mile-wide path across hawaii, baja california, mexico city and four central american capital cities puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history, says alan dyer, an editor of astronomy magazine. for one thing, chasing eclipses by trekking to remote regions with delicate astronomical instruments to capture a few minutes of data has lost much of its glamour, especially in times of tight budgets. for one thing, chasing eclipses by trekking to remote regions with delicate astronomical instruments to capture a few minutes of data has lost much of its glamour, especially in times of tight budgets. for another, some of the information now can be gathered any day of the year by using instruments that simulate a solar eclipse. solar wind studies at some observatories, astronomers will take repeated photographs of the corona during the eclipse to study it close up and to watch for material accelerating outward to become solar wind.
