the ministry statement said the federal military council met on march 25 and concluded that "dissident tendencies" in slovenia were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's communist government. but it said there was no discussion at the meeting "about a plan for action against special warfare in slovenia." the statement did not identify the foreign elements and said slovenia police later challenged the claim that there was such a conspiracy. slovenia's communist party presidium also "expressed disagreement with part of the military council's opinions," said the statement. it published a letter to slovenia's communist party leader milan kucan from two student unions that said military action had been planned earlier this year, including the arrests of "nonconformist journalists, writers and officials." it also said the army did not notify slovenia's civilian leadership of the planned intervention. the plan was blocked by kucan and stane dolanc, slovenia's member in yugoslavia's collective presidency, after they were told about it by slovenian security organizations, the letter said.
