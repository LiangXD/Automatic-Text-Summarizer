to justify seizing lincoln savings &amp loan assn., regulators arbitrarily wrote down the value of its $1.4-billion loan portfolio as 50% less and slashed the worth of its extensive land, hotel and stock holdings by 75%, the thrift's former owner said wednesday. reading from a federal home loan bank board analysis of lincoln's loan and equity portfolios prepared a week after the government imposed a conservatorship april 14, 1989, keating called the numbers absurd. the analysis, in the form of an april 21, 1989, memo from regulators in charge of the lincoln case to bank board officials in washington, is the first government document specifying regulators' estimate that alleged losses of federally insured deposits by the thrift could cost taxpayers $2 billion. comparing the figures from the regulators' analysis with those provided by american continental's chief financial officer, he testified wednesday that only 3% of lincoln's $1.4-billion mortage-loan portfolio was more than 60 days in default. james murphy, an attorney representing the treasury department's office of thrift supervision, repeatedly objected to keating comparing the numbers from the regulators' april 21 analysis and keating's own figures on the status of lincoln's loans and equity holdings as of dec. it wasn't until august that the regulators asserted that lincoln's alleged losses actually exceeded the value of its assets and imposed a receivership that took ownership of the thrift from keating. keating said that clark still holds titles as both the ceo and chief financial officer of lincoln under a contract that requires the government to pay him a $100,000 termination fee, but that other officials are actually running the thrift under the receivership.
