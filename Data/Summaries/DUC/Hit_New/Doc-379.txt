a bill signed into law monday by president reagan will sharply restrict employers' use of polygraph tests. because of the new law, employers who have relied heavily on lie detectors will have to resort to such alternatives as written tests that are designed to gauge a person's honesty, and background checks of job applicants -- something that critics of polygraphs say they should have been doing in the first place. managers and other white-collar workers in the securities industry have been subject to polygraph tests where circumstances warrant, the trade group says, adding that the decision to test hinges on the employee's access to negotiable instruments, currency or securities -- not on the employee's rank. while he was chairman of the securities &amp exchange commission, john shad testified in a congressional hearing on polygraph testing that brokerage houses need to keep using lie detectors to protect trillions of dollars of securities. victor kaufman, president of new york lie detection laboratories, a security-services firm whose clients include a number of brokerage houses, figures the law will knock out about 98% of our polygraph business. polygraph testing and scoring methods currently used in personnel screening have never been shown to be valid tests of truthfulness, said john f. beary, an assistant dean at georgetown university school of medicine, in recent testimony before congress for the american medical association. one banker who will be glad of the new restrictions is peter persaud, who says he was denied a job as a vice president of amerifirst bank in miami after twice flunking polygraph tests early this year.
