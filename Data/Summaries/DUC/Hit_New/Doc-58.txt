president bill clinton's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it' was one of the most popular lines in last year's election campaign. his idea of a strict two-year time limit on welfare cheques appealed to voters (especially 'reagan democrats') not just as a way of cutting government spending and thus reducing taxes, but as a solution to the nation's most pressing social problems. when pundits talk of a 'culture of welfare' they are referring mainly to the dollars 20bn spent on aid for families with dependent children, a benefit received by 5m single-parent families. after two years, welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer of a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage. but it would involve a huge expansion of public sector employment and cost perhaps dollars 50-60bn a year, far more than the clinton administration is willing to spend on welfare reform. next year states will receive federal assistance only if they ensure that at least 15 per cent of the 'employable' welfare case load is working or in training programmes by 1995 the required ratio rises to 20 per cent. mr clinton could tighten the definition of 'employable', so as to include mothers with children under the age of three, and set more demanding workfare participation targets, for example that 50 per cent of welfare recipients should be working or in training by the year 2000.
