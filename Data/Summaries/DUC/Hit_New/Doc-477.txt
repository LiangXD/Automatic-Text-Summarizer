prospects for enactment of the first minimum-wage increase in eight years have improved sharply in recent days, sparked by vice president george bush's call for a boost in the wage floor. wage-increase bills were languishing on capitol hill only two weeks ago, with many members of congress reluctant to support a wage rise in the face of heavy small-business lobbying and arguments that the increase would mean job losses. but the tide began to turn when mr. bush, the republican presidential candidate, voiced his support for a higher minimum wage soon after he was jeered by portland, ore., shipyard workers who have suffered pay cuts in recent years. now, with the senate debating a minimum-wage bill on the floor, and house members more eager to follow with similar action of their own, the national election dynamics have changed the whole issue, said robert martin, human-resources manager for the u.s. chamber of commerce, which opposes the legislation. president reagan, who had sternly characterized minimum-wage increases as causing unemployment, was quoted by the detroit news last week as saying he and mr. bush were in agreement -- there could be some {minimum wage} increase because of inflation. provisions that would tie increases in the minimum wage to rises in average manufacturing wages after three years have been stricken from the bills. the legislation's proponents say it's needed to raise the incomes of several million workers who are below the poverty line, and they insist that the majority of those earning at or near the minimum wage support or help support families.
