a major issue hanging over the 1990 census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas, but congress is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens. census figures are used to redistribute the 435 house seats among the states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local governments. undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the south, west and industrial states like new york, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted. the problem has been in deciding which states may count these people as residents. tom ridge, r-pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 million to run the state, justice and commerce departments next year, including $800 million to take the census. "every census since the constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens," observed rep. census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete illegal aliens, contending they cannot determine who is in the country legally.
