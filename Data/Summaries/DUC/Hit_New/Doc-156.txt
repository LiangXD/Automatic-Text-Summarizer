canadians were shamed, angry and saddened tuesday that national hero ben johnson was stripped of his olympic gold medal for using drugs to enhance his performance. sports minister jean charest, who called the incident "a national embarrassment," said johnson will be banned from canada's national team for life. charest said his government accepted the validity of the tests and the suspension would be effective pending an appeal from johnson. "from time to time people would come to me in a private way _ and this happened one or two times... that maybe ben johnson is using steroids or other drugs," he said. johnson was last tested in canada in february at a montreal laboratory. charest said he didn't press johnson to have a drug test because he thought the sprinter was aware that medal winners at the olympics would be tested for drugs immediately following competition. "everybody knew in advance that mr. johnson, if he wins a medal, was going to be tested," said charest.
