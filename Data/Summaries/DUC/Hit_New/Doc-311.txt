during the marshall hearings in 1967, the issue of the day was not abortion but crime, and the most controversial case was miranda v. mr. marshall refused, explaining that there were other cases pending on variations and interpretations of miranda and that, if confirmed to the supreme court, he would have to rule on those cases: on decisions that are certain to be re-examined in the court, it would be improper for me to comment on them in advance.... but mr. marshall held firm, stating that future cases would be related to interpretations of miranda, and that the issue of crime was still very controversial. sam ervin (d., n.c.) attempted to get mr. marshall to discuss the case law that preceded miranda, in much the same way that sen. ervin, exasperated, pointed out that since the jurisdiction of the supreme court is so broad that a case on practically any issue might come before it, mr. marshall's theory meant that the committee would have a difficult time asking any questions about mr. marshall's judicial philosophy. several other issues were brought up during the marshall hearings that have a bearing on judge thomas's case. committee chairman james eastland (d., miss.) raised this issue, but only to allow mr. marshall to clarify the facts, and to state that he was not a communist.
