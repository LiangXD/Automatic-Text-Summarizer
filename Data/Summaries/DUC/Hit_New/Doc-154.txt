st. martin's, 306 pp., $18.95 charlie francis, testifying in 1988 in toronto at a federal inquiry about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports, seemed a mad scientist, something on the order of dr. frankenstein. and because of that testimony, we have speed trap, an elaboration of what francis said at the inquiry and a history of his remarkable path through the world of track and field. he argues, essentially, that to be a world-class sprinter, you must use steroids -- he makes this argument even as johnson attempts a comeback for the 1992 olympic games in barcelona, spain, without them. by encouraging his athletes to use steroids -- and francis maintains that they all wanted to do so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up -- francis argues that he is simply helping to create a level playing field. francis would have us believe that without steroids, johnson cannot be the fastest. at the end of speed trap, francis says that steroids cannot be simply banned -- their use is too prevalent, they can be disguised too easily and they work too well. but speed trap left me wishing francis had at least tried his hand at philosophy.
