a review of campaign records by the times shows that keating, his companies and a circle of about 75 family members, associates and employees have showered more than $700,000 in campaign contributions on three dozen federal and state politicians over the last six years. keating's contributions have come under increased scrutiny since his company, american continental corp. of phoenix, filed for protection from creditors in u.s. bankruptcy court on april 13 and lincoln savings &amp loan, its principal subsidiary, was seized by federal regulators the next day. 'concerned' about seizure and one of those senators, democrat alan cranston of california, said friday that he intervened again a month ago by urging federal regulators to allow keating to sell his embattled s&amp l to a group headed by former republican rep. the next day, federal regulators seized lincoln, claiming that keating and american continental were operating the s&amp l in an unsafe and unsound manner. today, keating contends that his contributions merely give him a fighting chance against hostile regulators who drove american continental into bankruptcy proceedings because they didn't like his unconventional business strategies and his outspoken criticism of the regulatory structure. keating was born in ohio, and american continental is incorporated there. * nearly $166,000 has gone to 11 members of the senate and house banking committees, where deregulation of the savings and loan industry was conceived and implemented in recent years, much to the dismay of some regulators. likewise, four years later, keating did not contribute to president george bush's campaign, although american continental gave $80,000 to the california republican party.
