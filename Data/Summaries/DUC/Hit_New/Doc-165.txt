the tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, exxon shipping co. said sunday. the coast guard said the slick and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of about 100 square miles. exxon shipping spokesman brian dunphy told the associated press that the captain of the tanker exxon valdez, joseph hazelwood, was not on the bridge at the time of the accident and that third mate gregory cousins was in command. the 987-foot tanker exxon valdez, carrying 1.2 million barrels of north slope crude oil loaded at valdez, ran onto a reef 25 miles from the port early friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice. the only larger oil-related accident in u.s. waters was the spilling and burning of up to 10.7 million gallons of oil when two ships collided in galveston bay in 1979. more than four miles of floating boom had been placed in an effort to contain the oil, the coast guard said sunday. by late sunday, exxon officials said a total of 37,500 barrels of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation, leaving more than 900,000 barrels on the ship.
