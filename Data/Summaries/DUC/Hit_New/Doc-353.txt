claiming support from iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz, a soviet spokesman said the plan envisioned a total withdrawal within 21 days of a cessation of hostilities. the provisions include iraqi withdrawal from kuwait within 21 days of a cease-fire and supervision of the withdrawal by the united nations, vitaly ignatenko said. among the requirements for iraq, said fitzwater, was that withdrawal from kuwait city must be complete within 48 hours and from the country of kuwait in one week. bush's statement was his first public response to a soviet-brokered peace plan -- an effort the president said he appreciated, even while he declared that it attached unacceptable conditions on an iraqi withdrawal. bush said he had consulted with operation desert storm coalition leaders and they had agreed to the demands for iraq's withdrawal. the time has come to make public with specificity just exactly what is required of iraq if a ground war is to be avoided, bush said. bush said saddam risks subjecting the iraqi people to further hardship unless the iraqi government complies fully with the demands.
