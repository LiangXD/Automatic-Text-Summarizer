but in 1990, voters declared a plague on both parties' houses, underscoring what polls and other focus groups demonstrate: the disaffection with politicians isn't ideological. term limits would accomplish few of their proponents' goals -- more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists. more important, lawmakers ought to overhaul the disgraceful campaign-finance system to make congressional elections more competitive, and to reduce the role of money and influence peddlers in campaigns. the nexus of many of the problems -- entrenched arrogance, more concern for powerful interests than average citizens and the obscene preoccupation with campaign contributions -- is the committee system. while both men are deeply dismayed at the current state of congress, they see term limits as a cure worse than the illness. this really would challenge these guys to shake up the system, says mr. fenno, noting that the power of interest groups is centered in committees. mr. ferris believes this would put a vitality in the system while not resulting, unlike overall term limits, in a bunch of neophytes who'd be more dependent on staff and lobbyists.
