junk bond wizard michael milken officially ended his 20-year career at drexel burnham lambert inc. on thursday and said he will launch his own financial consulting firm while he awaits trial on racketeering and securities fraud charges. 'very emotional experience' the timing of milken's resignation appears to have been influenced by a supreme court decision last week that cleared the way for drexel to complete its announced plan to settle civil insider-trading and securities fraud charges brought by the securities and exchange commission. lowell milken had been a lawyer with the los angeles firm of irell &amp manella before he left in 1978 to help his brother run drexel's junk bond department. 'naturally disappointed' milken started out in 1969 as a part-time employee at drexel harriman, a philadelphia investment firm that was a precursor to drexel burnham lambert, while attending the university of pennsylvania's wharton school of business. the sec settlement's ban on drexel doing business either directly or indirectly with milken could be interpreted to mean that drexel can't do business with clients advised by milken. milken, his brother and former drexel trader bruce l. newberg are likely to go to trial on the pending criminal charges sometime early next year. lawyers for michael and lowell milken are challenging provisions of the settlement agreement, including a requirement that drexel withhold much of the brothers' compensation owed them for 1988.
