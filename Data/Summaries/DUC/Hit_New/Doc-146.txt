what he had stumbled upon was village banking, a system of investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance their private enterprise, allowing them to create savings while paying interest and qualifying for bigger loans. what hatch envisioned on that plane five years ago has translated into 400 village banks in nine countries with more than 35,000 members. village banks are operating in mexico, haiti, thailand, guatemala, honduras, costa rica, bolivia, peru and el salvador. catholic relief services entered a five-year, $1 million joint venture a year ago with the u.s. agency for international development and the foundation to create 40 village banks in thailand. their vehicle for improvement is the village bank, each comprised of 30 to 50 women who, through loans starting at $50, can earn enough to provide savings and create capital. rotary club 100, a phoenix organization, and a rotary club of mexico city are in a joint venture, having funded five village banks in guaymas, mexico, with another four to be launched in the slums of mexico city. hatch says he believes village banking has a role to play in reducing poverty along the mexican border and in slowing down migration to this country.
