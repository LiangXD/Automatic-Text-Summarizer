britain and the united states have kept their hopes of issuing mining licenses in the antarctic alive by refusing to accept proposals to turn the continent into a wildlife reserve. twelve days of talks here among the 39 antarctic treaty nations, discussions dominated by the mining issue, broke up friday night with a wide division between the pro- and anti-mining nations. australia and france had proposed that antarctica be turned into a wilderness park and that the minerals convention of 1988, which took six years to negotiate, be scrapped. britain and the united states refused to discuss this proposal and insisted that the conference should talk about implementing the convention and discuss clauses that would apportion liability in the case of mining pollution. the minerals convention creates a framework for mining under strict environmental guidelines. french officials said the conference had been a failure because britain and the united states had refused to discuss their proposals. jim barnes, from the antarctic and southern ocean coalition, representing 300 environmental organizations, said that the wilderness park proposals were still on the table, something he said gives us more time to push our case.
