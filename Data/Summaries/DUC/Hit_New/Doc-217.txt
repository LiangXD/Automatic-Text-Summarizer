"the whole place is running at the max, full out," reed jarvis of the boise interagency fire center said last week. but this year is different because the center's strategists and quartermasters who direct the nation's wildfire battles can see some of the worst blazes from their windows. as nearly half the acreage afire burns within 150 miles, specialists in the logistics center marshal resources from around the nation. "obviously, firefighting on the line is stressful," said fire center spokesman arnold hartigan. in the logistics center, specialists spin lazy susans with pink and blue requisition forms as each plea from the fire line is answered. it will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the nation's fires. until then, the lights will be on at the fire center, and the pace will be frenetic.
