no one, of course, can imagine powell carrying the democratic banner next year against president bush, his commander-in-chief. with his foreign-policy views powell would scrape against some encrusted conventions in today's democratic party. but powell's views do not represent a new mold for the party. rather, if he choose a political career as a democrat, powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's henry scoop jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions on defending u.s. interests abroad. nominating powell to a future national ticket offers republicans the chance to cement their presidential majority by breaking the democratic hold on black votes. for democrats, conversely, a national slot for powell could allow the party to simultaneously affirm its commitment to equal opportunity and dispatch persistent doubts about whether it is tough enough to protect american interests in an unstable world. if powell hints even the slightest interest, and democrats are uncharacteristically alert, it could set off the kind of bipartisan bidding war not seen since 1948, when activists in both parties tried to draft eisenhower as their presidential candidate.
