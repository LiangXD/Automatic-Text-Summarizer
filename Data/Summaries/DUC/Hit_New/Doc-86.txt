a 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in newark, n.j., has caught the attention of health officials, who had been previously recording with satisfaction a slow, steady decrease in tb cases over the last few decades. they attribute the 5 percent national increase in tb cases in 1989 to the ravages of the aids virus, which destroys the body's immune system and leaves victims open to tb infection, dr. philip c. hopewell of san francisco general hospital said sunday. about 4 percent of americans identified as having the aids virus also have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis, said dr. dixie e. snider jr., director of the division of tuberculosis control at the centers for disease control in atlanta. snider stressed that tuberculosis, unlike aids, is a curable disease and called for tb screenings at drug rehabilitation programs, prisons or other places where aids tests are being administered. moreover, unlike aids, tb is a highly contagious disease that can be spread by airborne particles coughed up by a person with untreated, clinically active pulmonary tb. snider said there has been a 150 percent increased in cases of tb among young blacks in new york city. reichman noted that most american have forgotten about the problems of tb from 1981 to 1984, tb cases declined an average of 6 percent per year according to the centers for disease control.
