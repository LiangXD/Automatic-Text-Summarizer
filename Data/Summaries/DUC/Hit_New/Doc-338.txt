u.s. tour operators are planning to send a record 4,000 or more travelers to antarctica, prompting calls for strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife and the very fate of the frozen continent. 22. manheim's appeal is urging the government to place strict controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on tourist observation of penguins and seals, and coordination of cruise ship visits to breeding grounds. "a year after antarctica's most significant environmental disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar catastrophes," said manheim. military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists have been frequent modes of travel to antarctica since the first tourists visited in 1958. military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists have been frequent modes of travel to antarctica since the first tourists visited in 1958. "antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the united states, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international level," said manheim. "the tourist visiting antarctica is a determined environmentalist, an avid lover of wildlife, and i can assure you that no tourist _ not one _ has hurt or killed a bird or animal," said lars eric lindblad, an antarctic travel pioneer who will lecture aboard the ocean princess.
