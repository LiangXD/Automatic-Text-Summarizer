a poor ventilation system that does little more than recycle old, stale air from one end of the building to another. millions of american office workers are getting more than they bargained for when they inhale in a building that has no fresh air. that's because, in today's modern office buildings, recirculated air can mean recycled flu and other airborne infections. in a study published in the august issue of the american review of respiratory diseases, nardell and colleagues at harvard medical school found that an outbreak of tuberculosis documented in one unidentified government building could have been cut in half had the ventilation been better. the building's ventilation system permitted circulation of some outdoor air -- 15 cubic feet per minute -- a low level commonly found in buildings since the 1930s. in the study, nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis. in his tuberculosis study, he found that the biggest benefit comes from improving the worst ventilation systems that allow very little fresh air.
