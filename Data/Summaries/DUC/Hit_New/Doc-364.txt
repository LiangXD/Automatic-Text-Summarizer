a wide array of anti-competitive practices which have been specifically outlawed by statute or (by) settled supreme court precedent would be rendered lawful if judge bork's antitrust views held sway, new york attorney general robert abrams warned yesterday, as the committee concluded 12 days of hearings on the supreme court nomination. but donald baker, a washington lawyer and former chief of the justice department's antitrust division, said in a statement that judge bork is in the mainstream of antitrust, which means his antitrust thinking.... is widely used by antitrust practitioners, antitrust courts and even antitrust professors. meanwhile, president reagan launched a new, more vigorous campaign on behalf of judge bork's nomination, which is losing momentum. speaking to representatives of groups supporting the nomination, he portrayed judge bork's opponents as liberal special interest groups, asserted that judge bork would be tough on criminals, and said there has been a deliberate campaign of disinformation and distortion waged against the nominee. in yesterday's testimony, robert pitofsky, dean of georgetown university law school and a former federal trade commission member, said judge bork advocates an antitrust program more conservative than proposed by almost anyone else. judge bork has argued for more reasonable interpretations of criminal procedures that assure both justice and the prompt conviction of criminals, rather than allowing dangerous criminals to go free on unjustified technicalities, mr. reagan said. white house officials think the view of judge bork as a champion of crime fighters is politically appealing but believe it hasn't gotten enough attention during the senate's confirmation hearings.
