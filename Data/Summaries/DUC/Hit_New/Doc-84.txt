drugs are now available that can put aids patients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a vaccine to protect against aids infection is possible, a panel of aids experts said saturday. at the same time, however, the aids epidemic is being followed by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists said. a year ago, the prospects for an aids vaccine looked doubtful, said james mullins of stanford university. vaccines to protect animals against aids-related viruses have shown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believe that similar vaccines can be found for humans. sten vermund, also of the allergy institute, noted that an epidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in aids patients in the inner cities. there is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have aids, but that is likely, vermund said. he said the rise in tuberculosis began before the aids epidemic, probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the 1970s.
