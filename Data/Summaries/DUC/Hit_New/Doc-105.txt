the panel, in recommendations thursday to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits to allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn. the panel suggested a temporary halt to the "let it burn" policy, saying the forest service and the national park service needed more time to refine their fire management plans. the report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened. it said actual fire management plans often have not spelled out when natural fires would be allowed to burn and when they would be put out. the agencies involved should make sure that fire management plans conform to departmental policies, that employees understand the policies, that everybody is using a common vocabulary and that agencies have agreed beforehand what to do if fires threaten to move across administrative boundaries, the report said. "no... natural fires are to be allowed until fire management plans meet these standards," the report said. plans should consider the effects of prolonged drought, fuel moisture content and the possibility that multiple fires will tie up fire-fighting resources, the report said.
