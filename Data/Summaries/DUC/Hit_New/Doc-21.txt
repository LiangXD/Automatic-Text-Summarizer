allegations of police racism and brutality have shaken this city that for decades has prided itself on a progressive attitude toward civil rights and a reputation for racial harmony. the deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry, followed 10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown hotel, touched off an outcry by minority leaders for an outside review of the department. the city's police chief, john laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society. in a series of rallies in recent weeks, protesters demanded that officers involved in the drug raid be suspended, charges against those arrested at the hotel be dropped, and that a citizen police review board be established. "there are bad apples in every bunch and the minneapolis police department is no exception," said councilwoman sayles belton. gleason glover, president of the minneapolis urban league, which works for interracial cooperation, said police racism has been a problem since he took over the league position 21 years ago. "the key point is that any time the head of the police department cannot hire, fire or impose discipline, you are no longer in charge," he said.
