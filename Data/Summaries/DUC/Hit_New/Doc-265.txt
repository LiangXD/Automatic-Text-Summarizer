the maoist shining path guerrillas who dominate peru's upper huallaga river valley have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region. in a rare conversation with reporters, a shining path political officer, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, gave an example of the kind of law the guerrillas have laid down: "do not steal so much as a needle or thread and return what you borrow." in a nation where economic chaos reigns and few laws are respected, the shining path is setting down clear rules and making them stick. but here in the jungle-cloaked upper huallaga valley, the world's largest source of coca leaf, the shining path _ "sendero luminoso" in spanish _ enjoys the support of tens of thousands of farmers because the rebels protect them against a u.s.-funded coca eradication program. for the coca and for revenge," said carlos ferrer, a taxi driver who travels the road between tingo maria and aucayacu. "a cop in the huallaga valley expects to be bribed," said a senior interior ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "if the shining path has the image of an organization that's fighting corruption in a very corrupt place, that's going to win them some points," feeley said.
