the names will be different, but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of hugo and gilbert may be prowling the atlantic, caribbean and gulf of mexico in the future. the probability of more intense hurricanes in the atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s, says meteorologist william m. gray of colorado state university, who analyzes hurricane patterns. gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the '50s and '60s, because of an apparent break in the periodic west african drought. the most intense hurricanes, gray explains, usually form at low latitudes from tropical disturbances moving westward from africa. hurricanes are classified by the saffir-simpson scale, the fiercest a no. outside the atlantic area and the eastern pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons or cyclones. the threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded, says meteorologist kerry emanuel of the massachusetts institute of technology.
