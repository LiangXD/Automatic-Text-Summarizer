on the day the 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage became the law of the land nearly 50 years ago, a wave of pecan-shelling and tobacco-stemming factories closed throughout the south and industries warned of economic mayhem. augustus hawkins (d., calif.), who head the senate and house labor committees, are expected to introduce legislation to increase the minimum wage from its current rate of $3.35 an hour to about $4.65 hourly over three years, with future automatic annual adjustments. what's less certain is the shape the bill will finally take, and whether a veto is inevitable from a president who once said the minimum wage has caused more misery and unemployment than anything else since the great depression. conceived as part of the new deal, the minimum wage was heralded at its birth as one of the most notable advances in our national effort to improve economic conditions in the united states. his research shows that income from the minimum wage was enough to raise a family of three out of poverty during most of the 1960s and 1970s. now, someone working full-time at the minimum wage earns $6,968 a year, or $1,773 less than the 1986 poverty threshold of $8,741 for a family of three. nearly 3.5 million hourly workers earn the minimum wage, according to the labor department, but it's expected that any increase would also benefit the nearly 1.5 million workers who are paid below the minimum and others who earn slightly above the minimum.
