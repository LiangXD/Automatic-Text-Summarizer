nearly one-quarter of 650 officers responding to a commission survey agreed that racial bias on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and community, and in some cases may lead to the use of excessive force, the report said. but the commission called for a shift away from the force's paramilitaristic, us-against-them style, and said the department must embrace the community-based policing style that encourages officers to spend less time in their cars and more time interacting with citizens in the communities they serve. mr. williams likened the report to the knapp commission, a 1970s blue-ribbon study that exposed widespread corruption in the new york police department and led to significant improvements there. as troubling as some of our findings are... they are not unique to los angeles, said john a. arguelles, vice chairman of the 10-member independent commission on the los angeles police department. it also should be reconstituted with members not linked with the current controversy, in the interest of a fresh start. -- a major overhaul of the police disciplinary system and the process used by citizens to file complaints against lapd officers, especially in excessive force cases, is needed. however, michael yamaki, one of the city's five police commissioners, believes that given the systemic problems in the department that have come to light, citizens now will be more willing to fund police issues. but the most surprising part of the report was its recommendation that chief gates resign, after a transitional period in which he would begin implementing the commission's proposals.
