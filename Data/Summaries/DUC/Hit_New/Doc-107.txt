"you eliminate all those causes, you're down to arson," said dale smallwood, a criminal investigator for missouri's mark twain national forest. arsonists set 172 of the 296 mark twain fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, smallwood said. on average, smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires each year in missouri are deliberately set. as one of the forest service's 125 special law enforcement agents, smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigating fires in the forests he loves. psychologist john p. shea in the 1940s conducted one of the first forest service studies of arson. in the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed, smallwood said. last year, a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the forest service.
