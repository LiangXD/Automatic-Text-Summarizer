sir, mr james skinner (letters, april 11) charges me with misuse of statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries. the statistics i used refer to latin america, the principal thrust of the argument of the bishop of oxford, which focused largely on brazil. this is like saying that banks, building societies, and governments issuing saving certificates are burdened when they pay interest. i do not know what mr skinner has in mind in referring to institutions serving only western interests, and by clear implication inflict suffering on the poor. what i do know is that throughout asia, africa and latin america the level of material achievement declines as we move away from the effect of western commerce. state help for the poorest, especially the rural poor, conflicts with the political and personal interests of the rulers, and may not accord with local mores. encouraging third world countries to default inhibits the inflow of productive commercial capital, which, together with the skills that went with it, over the last 150 years transformed life in many poor countries, notably in south-east asia, west africa and latin america.
