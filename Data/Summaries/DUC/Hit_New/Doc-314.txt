in so doing, milken, 42, transformed drexel burnham lambert inc. from a minor player on wall street into a powerhouse and in the process made himself feared, respected and enormously wealthy. the 184-page civil complaint filed in u.s. district court in new york against milken, drexel and others on wednesday followed months of speculation about drexel's involvement in the ivan boesky insider trading scandal. it was business as usual at drexel, and milken was still king of the junk bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate takeovers. milken had refused to comment publicly on the scandal up until wednesday, when he issued a written statement asserting that "for the past 22 months i have been the subject of a shadow trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based on false accusations." it had been a relatively short road for milken, from head cheerleader at birmingham high school in the san fernando valley in 1964 _ actress sally field and superagent michael ovitz were among his classmates _ to the top of the nation's financial industry. after studying business at the university of california, berkeley, and the university of pennsylvania's wharton school, milken went to work for drexel firestone &amp co. in philadelphia as a junior bond trader. drexel merged with burnham &amp co. in 1973 and lambert brussels witter in 1976 to become today's drexel burnham lambert, and milken's job was moved to new york.
