such droughts could be anticipated if the temperature abnormalities turn out to be predictable, one of the authors said in the report appearing in friday's issue of science magazine. such droughts could be anticipated if the temperature abnormalities turn out to be predictable, one of the authors said in the report appearing in friday's issue of science magazine. they noted that when asked what caused the drought that hit much of north america in 1988, meteorologists often reply "the jet stream was displaced northward of its usual position so that storms, which tend to track along the path of the jet stream, were similarly displaced northward." "such an answer is, however, just a brief description of the weather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at the cause. the authors took note of computer models predicting increased frequency of drought with the buildup of the "greenhouse effect" global warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. the authors took note of computer models predicting increased frequency of drought with the buildup of the "greenhouse effect" global warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. "the greenhouse effect may tilt the balance such that conditions for droughts and heat waves are more likely, but it cannot be blamed for an individual drought," they said.
