the images of los angeles police swinging nightsticks at king as he lay on the ground, played repeatedly on national news programs, were burned into the national conscience and led to widespread calls for investigation of police brutality. but government agencies, the press and civil libertarians have reacted quite differently to operation rescue videos showing apparent police brutality and to reports of police abuse of hundreds of the activists across the country. shortly after rodney king's beating, a news program on abc illustrating police brutality showed a still photo of police using a martial-arts weapon against a person being arrested, but there was no mention that the episode involved operation rescue. similarly, the cbs evening news reported march 27 on various aspects of police brutality but did not include examples involving anti-abortion activists, a producer said. it (police abuse) has not attracted much attention because a lot of people are not sympathetic to operation rescue, said dr. james fyfe, a professor of justice at american university in washington, d.c. police may also have a predisposition to use excessive force against the anti-abortion activists, said fyfe, a former new york city policeman. the aclu may support some of operation rescue's claims of police brutality, but sobel said it also has won a $110,000 judgment in a case in which the aclu had obtained an injunction against the anti-abortion group. the civil rights commission in 1989, under pressure from some members of congress, decided against an investigation of alleged police brutality against anti-abortion activists and decided not to ask the justice department to investigate.
