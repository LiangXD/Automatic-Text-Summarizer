in fiscal 1992, nearly half of all world bank adjustment loans failed to include specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of calls from mr preston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief. the share of bank lending allocated for 'human resource development' is still only 14 per cent, in spite of repeated calls from mr preston for an increased emphasis on investment in people. at a news conference mr preston said the bank was making progress: a decade ago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development and only 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus on poverty. while he expected an increase in the share of bank lending aimed at poverty relief, he declined to set precise targets for bank staff. mr preston, however, does intend to take several new steps to sharpen the bank's focus on poverty. mr preston said bank efforts to reduce poverty could succeed only if governments concerned co-operated. he said hoped for a clear signal from this week's meeting of the group of seven leading industrial countries that they would deliver on commitments for a dollars 18bn replenishment of resources for the international development agency (ida), the centrepiece of bank efforts to reduce poverty.
