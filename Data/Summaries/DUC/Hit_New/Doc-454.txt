the tolentinos and 100 other poor families along the albacan river in angeles, a once-bustling city of 280,000 people in the shadow of mount pinatubo, lost their homes saturday in mudslides and floods brought on by the volcano's powerful eruption. as many as 150,000 people fleeing the volcano were said to be crowding into evacuation centers monday night in manila, the capital, about 50 miles south of the volcano. manila's domestic and international airports were scheduled to reopen today, three days after they were closed because of concern that ash from the volcano would damage jet engines. despite the optimism from scientists, however, the exodus of families fleeing the volcano area continued late monday as buses and trucks caked with gray ash jammed roads leading into manila. angeles was without electricity monday and so many stores and gasoline stations were closed that it was difficult to find food and fuel. we have lost everything, but still i am happy, happy to be here, said romayo garcia, a 29-year-old mason, whose house near the now-evacuated clark air base, about 10 miles east of mount pinatubo, had collapsed from the weight of volcanic ash. garcia said he and several members of his family trudged nearly 20 miles through ankle-deep ash until they found a truck driver willing to take them to manila.
