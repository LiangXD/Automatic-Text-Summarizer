exxon officials monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of alaskan coastline fouled by the nation's largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a suspension of local environmental laws. "it is expected that this will be the case for all lightly oiled gulf of alaska sites," said the two-part, 60-page report. 15. exxon's plan calls for the recovered waste to be strained for usable oil that can be refined, and said the oil-laced wastewater could be treated at the alyeska pipeline service co.'s disposal plant in valdez. meanwhile, tar and sludge from the valdez spill fouled the beaches of alaska's wild katmai national park, drenching hundreds of sea otters and birds and threatening the huge brown bears prowling the refuge. the damage stretches along 260 miles of rocky, rugged coastline southwestward from cape douglas some 500 miles from valdez, park superintendent ray bane said monday. bane said an aerial survey showed an amorphous oil patch 10 miles wide and more than 20 miles long in the shelikof strait, which is located along the migration route used by whales. exxon also received sharp criticism from the federal government, which accused the company of "foot-dragging" in the construction of a second facility in seward to aid in the cleanup of sea otters fouled by the oil.
