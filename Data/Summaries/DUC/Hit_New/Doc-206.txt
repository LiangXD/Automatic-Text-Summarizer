britain and france were linked beneath the english channel on tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported. management sources at transmanche link, the construction consortium building the "chunnel" - the channel tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when british workers sent the probe through to french colleagues. "this is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that britain is no longer an island," said a construction union official. it's the first time we have air passing between the two tunnels," said gordon crighton, tunnel engineering manager. another day will be needed to be certain, technicians said, but they called the line-up "exceptional," considering the massive boring machines are drilling holes about three stories high. a work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding more pay on the french side appeared likely monday to stall the linkup until the weekend or beyond. a study released last friday in paris by transportation experts said the tunnel's completion will aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area of continental europe.
