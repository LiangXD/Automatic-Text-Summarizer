supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path hurricane hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast. forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models to track hugo's path into charleston, s.c. "overall, i think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where hugo would be so officials in south carolina could act in a timely manner," said research meteorologist colin mcadie. hurricane specialist gil clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships. to determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane. satellites can give a "pretty picture," he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path. "most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job," emmanuel said.
