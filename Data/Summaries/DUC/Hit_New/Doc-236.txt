with dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassroots organisations have succeed in fanning anti-nafta sentiment into widespread public hostility against the pact with canada and mexico. a new wall street journal poll, found opposition, at 36 per cent, had reached its highest level yet with only 25 per cent of those polled in favour of nafta. pro-nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting the opposition's success in framing the debate against nafta as a pact which would cost jobs. to keep the pro-nafta case before the public, president clinton wednesday took off for new orleans and top officials in his administration fanned out on speaking tours across the country. government agencies have been mobilised for the battle, given pro-nafta literature and instructed to boost the pact in seminars and public forums. in response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental, citizen and labour groups, vice president al gore, senator max baucus and other lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the largest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental side pact, held a briefing to praise nafta's environmental safeguards. seemingly unfazed by nafta's new show of life, the citizens trade campaign, one of the umbrella opposition groups, called a press conference to 'debunk' the clinton administration claim nafta would create 200,000 jobs in the next five years.
