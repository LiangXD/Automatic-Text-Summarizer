sadly, it is true that major steps in ship safety have followed great disasters: the general slocum fire, which killed 950 people in 1904, brought tighter requirements for life-saving gear and fire-fighting equipment the titanic, with its loss of 1,500 lives in 1912, brought rules on life-saving devices and certifying of lifeboat personnel in the '30s, the morro castle fire, which cost 124 lives, and the mohawk sinking, with a loss of 45 lives, brought regulations on the structure, equipment and materials of passenger ships. pollock fears that congress, the coast guard and the international maritime organization are not moving fast enough to mandate safeguards, despite 176 deaths last year in an arsonist's fire on the scandinavian star ferry in denmark, and the dramatic images of the cruise ship oceanos, which sank off south africa early in august, fortunately without loss of life. american passengers frequently assume that any ship they board in a u.s. port has met all coast guard safety requirements, a notion reinforced by coast guard approved labels on most life jackets, and fire systems on smaller boats and domestic ferries. in fact, the coast guard gives four inspections a year to ships that dock in the united states, but when the vessel is registered in another country, the coast guard only makes sure the ship provides whatever is required by international safety of life at sea regulations: twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers and life jackets for 125 percent of capacity, with the equipment in good condition. when the rules were initially adopted by the international maritime organization, it was assumed that older vessels would pass out of service, but this did not happen, according to marjorie murtagh of the coast guard, the u.s. fire-safety representative at the international maritime organization. in may, the safety committee of the international maritime organization met in london to begin amending the safety of life at sea rules. when the safety committee met in may, it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations beyond 1994 for new ships, possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service of vessels that cannot meet the new rules.
