rich steck, a spokesman for miami-based royal caribbean cruise line, which owns the ship, said it would return to miami on wednesday night after a coast guard safety inspection rather than continue the cruise. in washington, the national transportation safety board said a two-member team would meet the ship at miami to investigate the fire. the board has been concerned about the potential for accidents in the cruise ship industry and has held hearings around the nation. last year, it placed cruise ships on its most wanted list of safety improvements. steck said the fire, which started in a pantry between the fifth and seventh decks, apparently was caused by an electrical problem, but no details were available. the 2,318 passengers and most of the 818 crew members were evacuated to a nearby port terminal before they were allowed to return to the ship at daybreak, steck said. the 74,000-ton sovereign of the seas is one of the world's heaviest cruise ships and the largest in terms of its passenger capacity of 2,521, steck said.
