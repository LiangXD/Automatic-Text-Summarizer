in the past three elections, 96% or more of house incumbents who ran won. critics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not -- it's wrong to blame congress for the now nearly 100% re-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for. michael kinsley writes in the new republic that if incumbents always win, it's because voters can't be bothered. that takes money, and skewed campaign finance laws combined with taxpayer-paid junk mail effectively mean that only incumbents have the cash to make themselves known and to be taken seriously by the media. incumbents ended the 1988 elections with $63 million left over, while challengers were able to raise and spend a total of only $39 million. the polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way they can control congress effectively is by limiting terms. that's why the washington, d.c.-based americans to limit congressional terms is asking states to call for a constitutional amendment to limit terms.
