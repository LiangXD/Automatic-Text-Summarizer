canadian ben johnson left the olympics today "in a complete state of shock," accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal. many athletes accepted the accusation that johnson used a muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field. in a middle-of-the-night meeting with olympic and canadian officials, family members, coach and manager, johnson, 26, forfeited his most prized possession, the medal he'd had in his hands for only three days. james worrall, a canadian member of the ioc, said johnson "has been killed" as an athlete. johnson's name will go down in olympic history with other athletes who lost their gold medals, such as decathlete jim thorpe in 1912 because he played semi-pro baseball and swimmer rick demont in 1972 because he took an asthma medicine. "i feel sorry for ben and for the canadian people," he said today. dr. robert dugal, a canadian member of the ioc medical commission, called stanozolol "one of the most dangerous anabolic steroids.
