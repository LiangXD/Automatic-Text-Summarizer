judge thomas, who has been sitting on the federal appeals court in washington for just 14 months, won't be confirmed without a fight in the senate focusing on his inexperience on the bench and his strong opposition to affirmative action. while liberals will focus on judge thomas's legal inexperience, his record on the bench doesn't present them with the sort of target they had with the articulated, sharply conservative legal views of robert bork, whose supreme court nomination was defeated in 1987. a number of senate democrats, including judiciary chairman joseph biden of delaware, stressed when judge thomas was confirmed for the appeals court that he would face tougher scrutiny if he were nominated for the supreme court. abortion-rights groups are also likely to be concerned about the fact that judge thomas is a catholic who spent a year in a missouri seminary in the 1960s pondering the priesthood. as other supreme court nominees have done, however, judge thomas is likely to go to great lengths to avoid committing himself on abortion, an issue that is expected to come before the court again and again. judge thomas is well-liked by colleagues, both at the eeoc, where the new headquarters building is named for him, and at the appeals court. judge thomas, who just turned 43 last week, would be the youngest supreme court justice of the past 100 years with the exception of william o. douglas, who joined the court when he was 40.
