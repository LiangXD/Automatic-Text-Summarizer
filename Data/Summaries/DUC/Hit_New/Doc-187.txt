the 1990 atlantic hurricane season begins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the east and gulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a new era of destructive storms. 30 and was ushered in by a tropical depression last week in the caribbean that brought heavy rain to cuba and south florida but did not intensify into a hurricane. many coastal communities, with swelling populations, are ill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said robert sheets, director of the national hurricane center. the aftermath from hurricane gilbert in 1988 and hugo last year taught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate and protect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from maine to texas, sheets said. sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity are based on studies of past decades, atmospheric low-pressure waves and increased rainfall trends in west africa, near the breeding waters for most hurricanes. hurricane activity started dropping after drought conditions began in the early 1960s in africa's sahel region, he said. both gilbert and hugo reached category 5, according to meteorologist barry fatchwell of the national hurricane center.
