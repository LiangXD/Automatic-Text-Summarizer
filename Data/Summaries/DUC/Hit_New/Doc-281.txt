6 ballot would, among other things, limit the terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators. proposition 131 would limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive four-year terms, state legislators to 12 consecutive years in office proposition 140 would hold assembly members to six years in office, state senators and statewide elected officials to eight. term limits would give the people of california more control over the legislature, and the legislature would be less prone to special interests, because legislators would know they are going to be there for six years and they're out. robert presley, state senator (d-riverside) since 1974, formerly a member of the riverside county sheriff's department for 24 years, 12 of them as undersheriff: my guess is that in about 20 years, there would be another initiative to change (term limits) because we will have found that (they) didn't work. so, governing the state of california... is not as easy and simple as a lot of people would think. but legislatures also need strong committee chairmen, and term limits mean that relatively inexperienced people are going to be in leadership and that they are -- by definition -- lame ducks from the very beginning. as to what are the implications of term limitations in the state of california, a lot of people think that this is a partisan issue.
