crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s. following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the zimbabwean dollar, exports of farm produce in us dollar terms will be sharply lower, with tobacco earnings of less than usdollars 500m, compared with dollars 520m in 1991 (28 per cent of total exports). the collapse of sugar, cotton, and maize exports and reduced foreign earnings from coffee and tea will cost the country at least dollars 150m (10 per cent of exports) over the next 12 months. at the same time, the country will need to import at least dollars 350m worth of maize, wheat, sugar and possibly, later in the year, dairy products. after allowing for some reduction in other imports and higher exports of manufactures and some minerals, the balance of payments impact will exceed dollars 300m - at the very least - pushing the current account deficit above dollars 1bn, or 20 per cent of gdp. the traditional suppliers of maize to these countries - south africa and zimbabwe - will be importing up to 7m tonnes themselves this year (5m tonnes for south africa and 2m tonnes for zimbabwe). the reduced water flow through the kafue gorge in neighbouring zambia has forced lusaka to suspend electricity exports to zimbabwe, which next month will impose a 20 per cent electric power cut.
