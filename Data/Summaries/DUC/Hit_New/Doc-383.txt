a state court of appeal ruled monday that cities and counties may require applicants for jobs as police officers to submit to polygraph tests about their character and background. the decision sought to resolve an important question left open by a ruling by the state supreme court in 1986 that held unconstitutional any involuntary polygraph tests for public employees. according to attorneys in the case, at least half of the cities and counties in the state currently require applicants for public safety jobs to take polygraph tests. richard l. pinckard, a deputy city attorney representing san diego and three other cities backing vallejo in the case, said the ruling was especially important in view of state laws barring polygraph exams for officers already on the job. in support of his suit, he cited the statutes that prohibit officers from being forced to submit to such tests against their will, along with language in the 1986 state high court decision suggesting cities would bear a heavy legal burden in justifying the tests for applicants for public safety jobs. a solano county superior court rejected rust's claims and the court of appeal, in its ruling monday, affirmed that ruling, concluding that both applicants -- and ex-officers seeking reinstatement -- could be required to take the tests as a condition for getting the job. although 23 states, including california, have in some way restricted tests, 14 have specifically permitted law enforcement agencies to conduct them for applicants, the court said.
