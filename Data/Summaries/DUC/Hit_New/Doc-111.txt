"i believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and i believe that has now passed," dr. bernard weintraub, a lung specialist treating miss taylor at st. johns hospital and health center, said wednesday. the 58-year-old actress was taken off the ventilator that had aided her breathing for several days and was smiling again and "very happy the tube was out," said dr. patricia murray, an infectious disease specialist. "she said she'd come out and wave to you but she's not in her balcony attire," the doctor said. about 80 reporters and camera crew members, along with some 100 st. johns employees, jammed the hospital courtyard to hear the latest reports on miss taylor. in response to persistent rumors about aids and other illnesses, weintraub said there was "no suggestion of either cancer or infections commonly seen in aids." the actress had issued a statement earlier denying she has aids. weintraub said the actress, hospitalized since april 9, remained in intensive care.
