in a blow to california and other states with large immigrant populations, the senate voted friday to bar the census bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count. a senate-house conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against including illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped from a $17.4-billion appropriations bill for the state, justice and commerce departments. at stake are the number of seats in congress for california, florida, new york, illinois, pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis of next year's census. the issue cuts across partisan lines in the senate, with minority leader bob dole (r-kan.) arguing against the white house position on grounds that including illegal aliens in the census is unfair to american citizens. thad cochran (r-miss.) said that georgia and indiana both lost house seats after the 1980 census, and california and new york -- centers of illegal immigration -- each gained seats. pete wilson (r-calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the decennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx of immigration beyond the legal limits. opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical because the census bureau already has printed questionnaires that do not contain any question about legality of residence.
