the jwaneng mine, on the fringes of the kalahari desert in botswana, is known as 'a gem in the world of gems' because it almost certainly is the richest diamond mine in the world - at least in terms of the value of the stones it yields. all this goes to show that de beers, the south african group that dominates world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, still has complete faith in its ability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short-term difficulties such as those the company is experiencing with russia. the south african group believes that its control of at least 50 per cent of world diamond production gives it a powerful base from which to negotiate with the other producers who have marketing contracts with de beers' central selling organisation, in botswana de beers controls half of debswana, the company that owns the jwaneng mine, with the government owning the rest. jwaneng's open pit has reached a depth of 190 metres. mr loz shaw, chief geologist, says drilling down to 600 metres shows there are still plenty of diamonds at that depth and so the pit will go down at least that far. if experience at de beers' wholly-owned finsch mine in south africa is anything to go by, planning the underground development at jwaneng might already have started. yet the bottom of the finsch open pit - 423 metres -was not reached until 1990.
