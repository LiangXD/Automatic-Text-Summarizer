groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend large concentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seats in the house of representatives at the expense of other states. meanwhile, other groups want the final census totals to be increased to account for people who may be overlooked in the census _ most often blacks and hispanics living in urban areas. at stake are the 435 seats in the house, which are distributed among the states on the basis of population. "if both sides get their way, the only change would be a flip-flop of one seat from california to georgia," said william o'hare, director of policy studies for the independent population reference bureau. o'hare told a breakfast briefing for northeast and midwest members of congress that he estimates their region will lose 14 house seats following the 1990 census. the only change, he said, would be that california would gain five new seats instead of six, while georgia would add two rather than just one. o'hare's study of potential changes in house seats _ based on 1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for california to be the big gainer, adding six house seats, followed by florida with a gain of four and texas adding three.
