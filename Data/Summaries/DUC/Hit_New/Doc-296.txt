authorities questioned the badly injured pilot of a crashed boeing 737 wednesday, but revealed no clues as to why the jet's undamaged right engine was shut down well before the crash while the other engine burned. the civil aviation authority, meanwhile, ordered increased inspections on 37 airplanes with cfm56 engines, the type on the midland airways jet that crashed sunday. the statement from the department's air accidents investigation branch also confirmed that the airplane's left engine caught fire and the right engine was shut down, and that pilot kevin hunt had told ground control the fire was in the right engine. in the united states, nbc news quoted unidentified u.s. government sources as saying "the plane's flight recorders, which monitor engine performance and the pilots' conversations, indicate the crew shut down the wrong engine. a letter from a ge attorney last year said test records may have been falsified for the fighter plane valves. the civil aviation authority said that on the advice of investigators, it was issuing new instructions for the inspection and monitoring of boeing 737-300, boeing 737-400 and airbus a320 airplanes, all of which use the cfm56 engine. boeing commercial airplanes spokesman craig martin said in seattle of the faa's inspection order, "we certainly believe it's a prudent measure to go out and check to make sure there's nothing wrong with the fleet.
