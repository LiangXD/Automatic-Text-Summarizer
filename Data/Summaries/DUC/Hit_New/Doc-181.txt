william gray, a professor of atmospheric science at colorado state university, said friday he expects about six atlantic hurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but above average for the decade. the atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the last six hurricane seasons. those years brought just two to five hurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985. "it is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season," gray said in a paper presented to the conference. gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually occurred. drought in west africa is responsible for a drop in atlantic hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, gray said. forecasters and emergency management officials at the conference stressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during the lull in hurricanes a surge in storms, up to the levels of the 1950s and 1960s, could bring unprecedented damage, they said.
