others mentioned as possible candidates for the job were defense secretary richard cheney craig fuller, a republican consultant who was bush's chief of staff when he was vice president and longtime bush adviser frederic malek. as chief of staff, sununu has been given wide latitude by bush to manage domestic policy issues while the president devoted his attention to foreign affairs. sununu offered his resignation in a handwritten letter given to bush as the president was flying on air force one from washington to bradenton, fla., on tuesday morning. later, standing beside sununu on air force one, bush told reporters, he has taken a lot of hard shots that would have landed on my chin. despite the effusive praise from bush, sununu's resignation came after bush's son, george, informed sununu last wednesday that he was becoming a liability. gop consultant charles black said it became clear sununu had to go when he became the story and prevented bush's own message on the economy and other domestic issues from getting through. the resignation came amid bush's struggle to arrest a sharp decline in his public approval rating, fueled by persistent concerns that the economy is headed into another recession and that the president has been inattentive to domestic needs.
