a colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the english channel from the white cliffs of dover, pursuing a dream born in napoleon's time that is coming true at last. tunneling speed at the dover end is less than 15 feet an hour and the machine boring from the geologically more complex french end moves even slower, which is why the tunnel will not open until 1993. state-owned british rail will not commit itself to building a high-speed link from london to the tunnel in time to make the three-hour journey a reality in 1993. critics say the tangle of commuter lines in southeast england, so obsolete that trains can be delayed by a sudden fall of autumn leaves, will delay tunnel traffic. with trade barriers among the 12 eec countries set to fall in 1992, colin kirkland, technical director of eurotunnel's on the british side, says the tunnel will be completed this time. at its peak, the project will employ about 11,000 workers and 11 tunneling machines. eurotunnel will run shuttle trains once every three minutes at peak times between terminals near folkestone and calais, and british rail and the frenh state railroad will operate trains from london and paris.
