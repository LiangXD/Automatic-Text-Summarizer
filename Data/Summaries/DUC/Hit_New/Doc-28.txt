through the years mr. gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing, in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime. similarly, mr. gates vehemently opposed the police corps program backed by other police chiefs. mr. gates opposed the police corps because its members would not be professionals. many chiefs openly disagreed with mr. gates when he opposed the police corps bill in congress. public opinion polls in los angeles show the majority of people believe police brutality is common, and they disapprove of the way mr. gates has done his job. mr. gates's military style of policing is at odds with that in the rest of the country, and it's about time police leaders publicly repudiated it. it is hard to see how the los angeles police department can regain credibility unless daryl gates's leave becomes permanent.
