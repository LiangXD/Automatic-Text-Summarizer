hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population, and 40 percent of the 700,000 victims in texas are mexican-american. researchers take a customized mobile home to neighborhoods to randomly check hispanics and anglos for the disease, which deprives the body of insulin and can lead to complications affecting the heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves. san antonio's hispanic makeup led dr. ralph defronzo to abandon his prestigious position as a yale university diabetes researcher and persuade his four-member team to relocate to the university of texas health science center. an epidemiologist at the center, dr. michael stern, has devoted 10 years to studying hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study of type ii diabetes. stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income hispanics, fewer would get the disease. researchers believe that poor hispanics' diets of cheap, processed foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention _ either due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors _ increases their risk of acquiring diabetes. defronzo, who in 1988 was chosen the top diabetes investigator by canadian and japanese diabetes associations, says his unit at the health science center will try to use many of stern's patients for research.
