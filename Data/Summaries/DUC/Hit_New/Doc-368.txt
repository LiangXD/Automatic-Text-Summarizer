one reason why is that robert bork, former marine, former practicing lawyer, former yale professor of law, former solicitor general, former professor at yale again, former judge of the u.s. circuit of appeals, is now a best-selling writer. bork was nominated for the supreme court in july 1987 and four months later the democrat-controlled senate judiciary committee, after an often vitriolic debate, found him unfit for the job. he recalls the impact of a book he wrote a dozen years ago on antitrust law. bork has plans for perhaps two more books, one in more academic detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools, and another on the relationship of law and the culture. during the hearings, bork was astonished to learn that a radio reporter had gone to the video store he frequents and obtained a list of all of the tapes he had rented. bork enjoys the atmosphere at the american enterprise institute, the conservative think tank that has become his small university. bork, who abhored grading papers when he taught, says with a self-satisfied grin, "it's a very good faculty, with no blue books."
