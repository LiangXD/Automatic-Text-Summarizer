he always impressed me as being a good inside politician -- a good infighter, yet also a peacemaker, says michael burch, who was an assistant defense secretary when gen. powell was defense secretary caspar weinberger's top miltary assistant. when the reagan administration was planning its invasion of grenada, for example, gen. powell was serving as mr. weinberger's chief military assistant at the pentagon. gen. powell convinced mr. weinberger to warn the pentagon public affairs office a day in advance. gen. powell also has shown that he can present issues to his boss without seeming to impose his own views -- a skill useful in maintaining the image of honest broker of ideas important for a national security adviser. colleagues recall that when gen. powell thought an issue should be brought to mr. weinberger's attention, he often privately urged other officials to raise it at the defense chief's regular staff meetings. gen. powell was so trusted by mr. weinberger that he was one of the few government officials who knew of the secret arms sales to iran, and of mr. weinberger's strong objections and efforts to find out more about them. it isn't a term a grandiloquent national security adviser like henry kissinger would have used, but it's an indicator of the kind of efficient and noncontroversial nsc operation gen. powell can be expected to run.
