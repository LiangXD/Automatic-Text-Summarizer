safety standards may not be stringent enough in the cruise industry, the chairman of a federal agency investigating the march engine-room fire aboard the scandinavian star said wednesday. "there may not be sufficient safety standards," he said, adding that his agency has probed fires aboard four cruise ships in the past five years. the march 15 engine-room fire aboard the star, carrying 439 mostly american passengers, was discovered by a crew member as the ship returned from cozumel, mexico to its tampa home port. also, the ship's emergency generators didn't work for an hour, leaving the vessel without power in rough seas in the yucatan channel, according to ntsb reports released as the agency's three-day hearing opened here. because the ntsb lacks regulatory authority and because cruise ships are often registered outside the united states, he said his agency can only make recommendations. its engine room was badly damaged by the fire, and there was smoke and water damage throughout the 17-year-old french-made ship, which has since been repaired. "there was no further spreading," said schaab, who was praised by burnett for his 268-member crew acting quickly to move passengers from ship discos, bars, shows and dining rooms.
