the pro-nafta forces, exulting over the debate victory of vice president al gore over texan billionaire ross perot, hoped they had finally captured the elusive momentum necessary to carry them to victory in the house vote next wednesday. arthur andersen &amp company yesterday released a survey, by its tax and business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives of medium-sized companies in canada, mexico and the us strongly support nafta. meanwhile in mexico the country's congress launched a fierce attack on mr perot and other critics of its political system yesterday, in a furious response to mr perot's comments in the debate. us opponents of nafta believe that fear of job and investment losses to mexico will outweigh any new-found enthusiasm for the pact. trying to blunt any momentum for the administration, congressman david bonior, an anti-nafta whip, on wednesday announced that he had 219 of 434 members pledged to vote against the pact. ms lori wallach, an anti-nafta leader, said nafta would be won or lost in the congressmen's home districts. the anti-nafta citizens' trade campaign is bringing 'nafta claus' to the capitol to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell nafta to a reluctant congress.
