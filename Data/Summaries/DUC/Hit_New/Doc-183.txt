hurricane chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the texas and louisiana coasts monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside. shortly thereafter, the national hurricane center in miami announced that chantal was blowing at more than 74 m.p.h., strong enough to move it into the lowest hurricane classification, and the winds were later reported at 75 m.p.h. the best estimate monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the western louisiana or upper texas coast. bob ebaugh, a weather specialist at the hurricane center, said 10 to 15 inches of rain was expected in southern mississippi, louisiana and east texas. grocery stores began reporting a steady demand for hurricane staples -- bottled water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows. besides heavy rains and wind, the hurricane is expected to cause tides 5 to 7 feet above normal. chantal is the third named storm since the beginning of the hurricane season june 1.
