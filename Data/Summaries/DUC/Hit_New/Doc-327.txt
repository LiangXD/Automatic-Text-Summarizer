these days, sununu seems to be making a habit of going the wrong way: the latest flap is over his taking a chauffeur-driven white house car to new york to attend a stamp auction. sununu's latest problems stem from his use of his official car to go to new york for a stamp auction. but the incident raises questions about sununu's judgment because it came only a few weeks after reports of his use of government jets for personal and political purposes. the latest flap has dominated white house briefings the past two days and prompted bush to suggest wednesday that sununu shouldn't use his government car for such purposes again. i recognize, and i think the governor (sununu) does, there's an appearance problem, said bush, who nonetheless defended sununu's use of the car as permissible in this case and said sununu's job was safe. white house spokesman marlin fitzwater, amplifying bush's comments, made it clear that bush had told sununu that he was concerned by the appearance of impropriety and that he wanted his chief of staff to take no more embarrassing trips. and some former white house officials say sununu should recognize that he is not serving bush well.
