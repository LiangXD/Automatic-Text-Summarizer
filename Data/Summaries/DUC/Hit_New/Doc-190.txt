mr. gray said the west african sahel region is the newest of five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane activity. comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the sahel with the number of high-powered atlantic hurricanes, mr. gray found a striking correlation. from 1947 to 1969, for instance, rainfall in the western sahel was especially abundant, and during this time there were 13 severe hurricanes that formed in the atlantic ocean. from 1970 to 1988, the sahel suffered through a terrible drought, and hurricane activity was unusually low only one severe hurricane, gloria in 1985, formed in the area. mr. gray searched back in recent history and found that the sahel, which includes parts of senegal, mauritania, mali and gambia, goes through long periods of alternating dry and wet weather. hurricane activity was much higher during this time than during intervals when the sahel was dry. mr. gray said his research suggests that climate changes in the sahel don't result from global warming problems associated with environmental pollution but from natural weather cycles.
