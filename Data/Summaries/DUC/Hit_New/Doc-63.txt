howard metzenbaum, d-ohio, said the senate judiciary committee, in confirming four justices without learning how they felt about abortion, has given them a free ride and should be tougher in ferreting out thomas' views. i will not support yet another reagan-bush supreme court nominee who remains silent on a woman's right to choose, and then ascends to the court to weaken that right, said metzenbaum, the only member of the judiciary committee who voted against thomas' nomination to the circuit court of appeals to the district of columbia. patrick leahy, d-vt., said in the past few months alone the supreme court is throwing out past decisions, and i think it is legitimate to ask judge thomas, what do you think of settled law, like roe vs. wade (legitimatizing abortion), what do you think of a woman's right to privacy, free speech issues, issues of freedom of religion. when head of the eeoc during the reagan administration, thomas seemed to go out of his way to find ways to weaken some of the basic civil rights protections, said simon, a member of the senate judiciary committee. now that president bush has nominated clarence thomas to the supreme court, the next step is up to the senate. (box)if confirmed promptly, thomas could be on the supreme court by the time it begins hearing cases in october.
