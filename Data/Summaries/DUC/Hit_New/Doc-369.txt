robert h. bork, who once hoped for a supreme court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court monday. representing citibank in a big-stakes battle, bork argued that u.s. banks with branch offices overseas should not be required to pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts. there were no references to that fight monday as bork engaged in debate with the justices and opposing lawyers over the complexities of federal banking law and related matters. bork was treated much the same as any attorney who appears before the justices. justice anthony m. kennedy, who occupies the seat that eluded bork, directed a few questions at bork. bork, 63, a former federal appeals court judge, is a fellow at the american enterprise institute and will begin teaching constitutional law in the fall at the george mason university law school in arlington, va. bork was only the sixth man this century to be denied a supreme court seat by the senate and the 26th in its history.
