the question has burned with special intensity since scrapie, the form of the disease in sheep, jumped to british cattle a few years ago after they were fed ground-up parts of infected sheep. yet sheep have never been strongly implicated in cases of the human form of the disease, creutzfeldt-jakob disease, or cjd. now villagers there call cjd our sheep disease. indeed, cjd is a nefarious trickster the first reported case of the disease, which entered medical texts in the 1920s, really wasn't cjd after all, scientists now believe. based on the clues, dr. gajdusek, back at nih, led studies in the 1960s showing kuru, cjd and scrapie to be essentially the same infectious disease, studies that won the 1976 nobel prize for medicine. in the early 1980s, scientists discovered that cjd, like alzheimer's disease, often gums up the brain with a kind of junk, or amyloid, protein. still, dr. brown and other scientists aren't much worried about mad cows because their animal studies show spongiform disease is very hard to transmit orally.
