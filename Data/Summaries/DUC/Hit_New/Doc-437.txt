they're going to begin dying like bloody flies, said ed rist, head of care's east africa unit. even as africa slips into what could become the worst human disaster in its history, there is debate about whether the united states should aggressively intervene or offer assistance with political conditions attached. interest in a disaster is contingent on media coverage, said alex dewaal, associate director of london-based africa watch. other famines there, most recently in the mid- and late 1980s, focused the attention of westerners with the media's shocking images of the crisis, including skeletal children suckling at their mothers' dry breasts. by the time we see the kind of pictures that would motivate people to act, it will be too late, said peter laugharn, coordinator for save the children's horn of africa program. human rights violations outlined in reports by africa watch and amnesty international have led some people to suggest that the united states and united nations should attach conditions to humanitarian aid. although officials at the agency for international development won't confirm it, relief workers say the agency diverted a shipment of food from mozambique until the country promised the food would be delivered to its hungry population instead of to the army.
