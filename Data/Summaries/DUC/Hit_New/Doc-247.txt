jezersko, yugoslavia -- on wednesday, the slovene soldiers manning this border post raised a new flag to mark slovenia's independence from yugoslavia. less than two days after slovenia and croatia, two of yugoslavia's six republics, unilaterally seceded from the nation, the federal government in belgrade mobilized troops to regain control. in croatia, the army moved into areas where fighting erupted between croats and minority serbs, yugoslavia's two largest nationalities and historic rivals. the nationalist governments of slovenia and croatia have been demanding a looser confederation of sovereign republics. serbian attempts to deny croatia and slovenia their independence are motivated by two fears. and they fear losing the economic support of slovenia and croatia, the two wealthiest republics. together, slovenia, with two million people, and croatia, with five million, supply nearly two-thirds of yugoslavia's foreign exchange and about half of the country's gross national product.
