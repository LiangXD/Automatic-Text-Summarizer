the site of the signing ceremony in sacramento sent a warning to the city's congressman, mr bob matsui, one of the leading proponents of nafta in the us house of representatives. with just a shoestring budget - no more than dollars 200,000 (pounds 134,230) a year in cash - foes of nafta have worked for three years to mount a massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the american public. nafta's us proponents - mostly the business community - are spending millions, bypassing the voters, to convince congress to pass nafta. although the clinton administration weeks ago said it would appoint a 'nafta czar' to shepherd the pact through congress, it has yet to announce it has found anyone to take on the task. nafta foes have pooled their meagre resources to provide him with a campaign office, and field legislative directors. nafta foes around the country say their protests have persuaded congressman to back away from support of the deal. the side pacts will be 'silly,' she said, 'it's the same old bush nafta with the supplementals used to create a fig-leaf.'
