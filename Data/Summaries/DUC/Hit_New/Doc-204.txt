"we will have the money to finish the project," says alastair morton, british deputy chairman of eurotunnel, the privately owned anglo-french company overseeing the work. while the french are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link to their end of the tunnel, for example, state-owned british rail is dragging. "britain becomes branch line of europe," a guardian newspaper headline declared after the government announced june 14 that it would not fund a high-speed rail link between london and the british end of the tunnel. eurotunnel chairman andre benard said the company has provided for any foreseeable problems, but stressed: "we always made it very clear that this was a risk project." eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent of britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the first year. eurotunnel says it doesn't expect to p end of the century, and probably won't pay shareholders a dividend until 1999, four years later than envisioned. in october, concern about the rising pricetag drove eurotunnel's banking syndicate to freeze funds for three months until the company reached a truce with trans-manche link, the consortium of 10 british and french contractors doing the construction, over responsibility for $1.7 billion in overruns.
