negotiations for a new contract between botswana, the world's most important diamond producer in value terms, and de beers, the south african group which controls 80 per cent of the market for rough (uncut) diamonds, are taking much longer than expected. if botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth about usdollars 100m, independently of the cso - which sells about dollars 4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to market stability, idc said. 'this profit is disproportionate to the sale of diamonds by debswana (de beers' subsidiary in botswana) to the cso as a percentage of the cso's total sales profits,' idc says. de beers insists it remains on cordial terms with botswana and says the country is still selling its diamonds through the cso. the botswana government recently set up a diamond cutting centre with de beers' technical help, and this, too, should further the country's understanding of the market. there has been a special relationship between the cso and botswana since 1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to de beers in exchange for an estimated usdollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the south african group. de beers, which itself mines about 40 per cent of the world's annual rough diamond output, markets stones from angola, australia, namibia, tanzania, zaire and the soviet union, as well as south africa and botswana.
