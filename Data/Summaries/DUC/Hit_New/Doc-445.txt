if it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining clark air base, he said. even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, lipman said. scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the mount unzen volcano in japan, he said. the five usgs scientists are among the few remaining people at clark air base, which was evacuated along with thousands of filipinos living near the volcano. the researchers, along with 10 filipino scientists and their equipment, today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches. (these volcanoes -- including mount lassen in the sierra nevada, and mount rainier and mount st. helens in the cascade range -- arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.) risk to planes such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base, lipman said.
