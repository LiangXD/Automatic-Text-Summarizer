wildland firefighters, whose only protection is the cotton bandanna covering their faces, lose as much as 10% of their lung capacity after one routine season, and the damage persists for weeks, according to the studies by the california department of health services and the johns hopkins university school of hygiene and public health in baltimore. the worst doses of carbon monoxide and other hazardous chemicals, which can be fatal, are given off when fires smolder, the stage in which firefighters spend most of their time, said darold ward, a u.s. forest service chemist. but the u.s. forest service and state and county fire officials have been unable to protect their wildfire crews because they know of no gear light enough for firefighters to wear while hiking miles in burning terrain or effective enough to filter out the wide variety of toxic materials in smoke. the johns hopkins tests, conducted on 52 northern california wildland firefighters during the 1988 season, showed that their lung function -- or flow of oxygen -- remained reduced by as much as 3% even eight weeks after exposure. the california health department's tests on 63 firefighters showed they lost as much as 10% of their lung capacity during one six-month fire season, with an average loss of 4%. although the findings of the national studies have not yet been published, word has spread to top officials in the state forestry department, who say they are now starting to search for protection for the agency's 3,500 full-time firefighters and about 2,000 seasonal ones. immediately after the 1987 fires, ford and other researchers from johns hopkins and the california health department mounted studies.
