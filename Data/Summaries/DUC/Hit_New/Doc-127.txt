the second amendment, in its language and its history, makes plain that the need for a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition for the right to keep and bear arms. yet mr. goldwin treats it as a necessary condition, which enables him to conclude that congress could deny an individual the right to own a gun if he did not join the national guard. the right of the people to serve in the militia. yet mr. goldwin believes the amendment means, as he later says, that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the militia. roger pilon senior fellow and director center for constitutional studies cato institute washington --- the militia is not the national guard but rather the people of the original states. in my personal celebration of this 200-year-old document, i have pledged the following: i will give up my freedom of speech when they cut out my tongue i will give up my right to worship when they have slain my god and myself i will assemble with the people of my choice even when they are imprisoned, and i will give up my rifle when they pry my cold dead fingers from around it. updating the right to bear arms from 1791 to 1991, when i report for service i'll bring, as required, a few items consistent with the current infantryman's inventory: a barett light.50 semiautomatic sniper rifle, so i can reach out and touch people half a mile away a squad automatic weapon firing 5.56mm rounds at the rate of a whole lot per second out of 30-round clips or hundred-round belts a 40mm grenade launcher... but you get the idea.
