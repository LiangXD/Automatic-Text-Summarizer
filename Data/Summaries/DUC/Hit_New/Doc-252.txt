in the view of yugoslav diplomats, the normalization of relations between slovenia and the federal republic of yugoslavia will certainly be a strenuous and long-term project. a signal that relations between yugoslavia and slovenia might be reconsidered came this time from the slovene capital. yugoslav sources claim that slovenia is becoming increasingly isolated because of its extreme policy toward yugoslavia, so that this might be one of the reasons why it has decided to soften its attitudes toward yugoslavia. the first signs of a change in the slovene attitude toward yugoslavia were noticed during the visit of karolos papoulias, the greek foreign minister, and vaclav havel, the czech president, to slovenia, in november 1993. <h5> diplomatic pirouettes </h5> at that time the press carried statements made by milan kucan and lojze peterle that unquestionably represented a shift in policy toward belgrade. in the focus of serbian attention now are relations with croatia, and as far as slovenia is concerned, the official proposal for the normalization of relations has to be specified first. single statements and diplomatic pirouettes are not enough to overcome the present differences, including the slovene attitude toward kosovo, the interruption of economic relations, the way slovene independence was achieved by force, and diplomatic duels on the international scene. <h5> [box, p 7] </h5> <h5> jovanovic: slovenia must excuse itself </h5> in order to enter the process of normalization of relations with slovenia, certain conditions must be fulfilled first, vladislav jovanovic, fry minister of foreign affairs, said in a statement for politika, and added: first it is necessary for slovenia to excuse itself for the rude and impertinent move it made a year ago in refusing the yugoslav offer of recognizing slovenia. we are, of course, interested in normal relations between slovenia and yugoslavia, but some prerequisites have to be fulfilled, jovanovic concluded his statement.
