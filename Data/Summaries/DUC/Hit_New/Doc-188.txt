people caught by hurricane hugo last year might disagree, but forecasters here say the deadly storm may have had a positive side effect _ it got the public's attention. early warnings about hugo last september allowed 350,000 people to evacuate safely, and in south carolina the worst of the hurricane struck the francis marion national forest between charleston and myrtle beach, sheets said. if hugo had struck a major coastal population center, the destruction would have been greater than most americans have ever seen, according to computer simulations known as slosh models, for sea, lake and overland surges from hurricanes. with slosh, forecasters can predict the height of the storm surge _ the mass of water piled up by the storm that is a hurricane's most destructive component _ anywhere along the u.s. coast by punching in a storm's speed, size and intensity, sheets said. according to one of the nation's leading hurricane experts, hugo may have been the first in a new era of killer storms. he had figured the 1989 season would be relatively mild, with only four hurricanes instead, seven hurricanes and four tropical storms killed a total of 84 people. a tropical depression becomes a tropical storm and is given a name if its sustained winds reach 39 mph it becomes a hurricane if winds reach 74 mph.
