a continent bigger than america, covered in ice more than a mile thick, antarctica is isolated by winds and currents that make it the coldest, driest place on earth. this is the story of three groups of scientific sleuths in antarctica: biologists studying the antifreeze systems of fish glaciologists examining whether the west antarctic ice sheet will break apart and flood the world and cosmologists searching for the birth of galaxies. seawater under the ross ice shelf ranges from 28 degrees to 29.5 degrees -- cold enough to freeze most fish as hard as mrs. pauls's. now 52, with a graying walrus mustache and walrus girth, dr. devries is one of the last of the old antarctic hands still conducting research on the ice, as the place is called here. one sunny afternoon in november, dr. devries and joseph eastman, a longtime associate who teaches at miami university in ohio, fish through a hole in the ice. the ice inside the fish had grown explosively at the lower temperature, dr. devries explains, wrecking the fish's nervous system and cells. general foods has experimented with fish antifreeze to see if it can prevent ice crystals from ruining ice cream that's left out of the freezer and put back melted.
