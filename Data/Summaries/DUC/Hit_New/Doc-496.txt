gen. colin l. powell, who is expected to be named the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, is described by colleagues as a "soldier's soldier" who doesn't particularly like staff jobs. the 52-year-old son of jamaican immigrants, powell was highly regarded by president reagan, succeeding frank c. carlucci as reagan's national security adviser. a senior administration official said in washington on wednesday that president bush is expected to name powell to the position. powell took over u.s. forces command, or forscom, in april, putting him in charge of troop readiness and deployment for the u.s. army. washington colleagues have described powell as a "soldier's soldier" who doesn't like staff jobs. carlucci says that powell has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that reagan got powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the general had turned carlucci down several times. on the job, powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he became forscom commander.
