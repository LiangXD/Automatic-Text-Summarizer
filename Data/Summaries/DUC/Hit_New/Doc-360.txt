in choosing federal judge robert bork for the supreme court, president reagan has tapped a leading architect of conservative legal theory -- and has ensured a tough confirmation battle in the senate. the selection of the 60-year-old judge bork to replace retiring justice lewis powell gives the president his third supreme court appointment and by far his greatest opportunity to alter the court's direction. but in judge bork, appointed by mr. reagan in 1982 to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia, the president has picked a rare judicial -- rather than a political -- conservative, a judge committed to a narrow role for the courts rather than to the reagan administration's political agenda. and liberal democrats on the senate judiciary committee, fearful that mr. reagan's choice may upset the supreme court's moderate balance, have made clear they will fight any candidate whose views about the constitution and the courts are too conservative. committee democrats say they don't expect to start hearings until september, raising questions about whether judge bork would be approved by the supreme court's opening next oct. in 1973, president nixon tapped him to be solicitor general, the justice department official who represents the executive branch before the supreme court. it was that 1965 ruling that was the basis for the supreme court's 1973 decision recognizing a woman's right to an abortion, and judge bork's criticism of sexual privacy has caused alarm among women's groups over his nomination.
