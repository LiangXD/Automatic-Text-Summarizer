a seriously ill elizabeth taylor battled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by a ventilator, doctors say. hospital officials described her condition late monday as stabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the pneumonia. miss taylor entered daniel freeman marina hospital on april 9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said. her condition worsened and she was transferred april 16 to st. john's and moved into intensive care on friday. while it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator, it does not mean that person is near death, said dr. john g. mohler, a university of southern california lung disease expert who emphasized he had no direct knowledge of miss taylor's condition. doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restore oxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathing difficulties have reduced those levels, mohler said. during a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, miss taylor underwent a tracheotomy, an incision into her windpipe to help her breathe.
