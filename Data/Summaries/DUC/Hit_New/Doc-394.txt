the navy announced friday that 15 crew members of the uss vincennes, the cruiser that shot down an iranian jetliner in the persian gulf last summer, will be disciplined for drug abuse. "there is no connection now to the july 3 incident in the persian gulf to what has happened on board the vincennes," said navy cmdr. the vincennes, meanwhile, will be shifted to long beach naval shipyard within five weeks for modifications to correct deficiencies in the aegis electronic combat control system, the (san diego) tribune reported friday. aegis, which would enable a ship like the vincennes to make computer-recommended battle decisions for entire fleets, was found flawed in the persian gulf confrontation. of the 15 sailors, six are being processed for discharge from the navy, while six others have been given warnings, dillon said. the announcement came as preparations were under way at the naval station san diego for saturday's change of command aboard the vincennes. rogers will be rotated to a new assignment at the navy's tactical training group in san diego.
