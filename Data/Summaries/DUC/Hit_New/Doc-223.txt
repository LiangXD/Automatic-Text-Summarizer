flexing its muscles as a cartel, de beers consolidated mines ltd. is raising its diamond prices an average 10% next month. the south african concern, which controls 80% of the world diamond market through its london-based central selling organization, sells a vast array of diamonds, varying in quality and size, dealers say. by changing the mix of diamonds that it sells to dealers several months ago, de beers signaled to the market that it intended to raise quotes, he said. de beers decided to raise prices because rough diamonds were already trading at a premium over its own quotes on the open market, said andrew lamont, a company spokesman. in the first seven months of 1987, japanese imports of polished diamonds surged 60% from the similar period last year to $777 million, he added. to meet growing orders from diamond dealers and cutters who supply the retail trade, de beers sales of rough diamonds jumped to $1.56 billion in the first half of this year from $1.2 billion in the similar period in 1986. only about 10% to 20% of the diamonds are gems, but de beers must continue to find new markets, they say.
