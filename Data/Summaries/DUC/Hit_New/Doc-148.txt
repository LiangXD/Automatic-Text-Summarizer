the world bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issued today by mr lewis preston, the bank's president. the link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990s. the shift in priorities is also reflected in a commitment to make comprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the third world, allowing the bank to design more effective policies to fight poverty. the bank is also publishing a handbook containing examples of past best practice on poverty reduction. these would form the basis for a 'collaborative approach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank'. mr preston's emphasis on poverty is a reaction to bank policies in the 1980s, when the aim was to improve economic efficiency in developing countries. the new directive says structural adjustment lending in the past decade 'overshadowed the bank's poverty reduction objectives'.
