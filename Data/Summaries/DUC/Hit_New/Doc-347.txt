the persian gulf showdown between iraq and the united states took a more personal turn thursday when iraq's saddam hussein called president bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war could bring thousands of americans home in coffins. bush, commenting on the two-week-old gulf crisis from his vacation home in maine, said he saw little reason to be optimistic about a settlement of the dispute, which stems from iraq's invasion of oil-wealthy kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the border of saudi arabia. after a two-hour meeting at his kennebunkport home with king hussein of jordan, bush said, "i did not come away with any feeling of hope" that iraq would withdraw its army from kuwait. bush also said thursday that king hussein assured him jordan would close the last remaining free port to most iraqi trade as the economic embargo on materials to iraq continued unabated. john prescott, a shipping correspondent, said there was no shipping in kuwaiti or iraqi ports and that activity was trailing off in the jordanian port of aqaba. bush's chief objective in his meeting with hussein was to press the king to shut down iraq's food and oil supply route from aqaba on the red sea. the president also has offered to help offset jordan's costs because 40 percent of its exports go to iraq and 90 percent of its oil comes from there.
