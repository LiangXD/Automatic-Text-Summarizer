lilongwe june 6 sapa -- three million people will need emergency food aid in 1994/95 following widespread crop failure in central and southern malawi, the united nations food aid organisation [fao] said on monday [6 june]. this year's cereal production among smallholders is estimated to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest, and only 28 per cent higher than in 1991/92, when drought devasted southern africa. another 270,000 tons would be required to be sold in the market to stabilise food supply and prices. that happened during the big drought of 1992. despite a bumper harvest last year, malawi has not recovered from the massive 1991/92 drought. the sharp decline in the production of major crops such as tobacco and cotton due to drought means reduced incomes for many rural households. although landlocked, malawi proved in the 1991/92 drought it was adequately equipped to handle the transportation, storage and internal distribution of large volumes of food imported through south africa, mozambican or, possibly, tanzanian ports [words indistinct].
