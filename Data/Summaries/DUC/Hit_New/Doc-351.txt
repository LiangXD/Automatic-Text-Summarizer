here is the text of president bush's address to the people of iraq, as released by the white house: i'm here today to explain to the people of iraq why the united states and the world community has responded the way it has to iraq's occupation of kuwait. saddam hussein has told you that iraqi troops were invited into kuwait. nor, until the invasion of kuwait, has the united states been opposed to iraq. in fact, the occupation of kuwait is helping no one and is now hurting you, the iraqi people, and countless others of the world's poor. the united nations has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish the iraqi people, but as a peaceful means to convince your leadership to withdraw from kuwait. when iraq returns to the path of peace, when iraqi troops withdraw from kuwait, when that country's rightful government is restored, when all foreigners held against their will are released, then, and then alone will the world end the sanctions. iraq must get out of kuwait -- for the sake of principle, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the iraqi people.
