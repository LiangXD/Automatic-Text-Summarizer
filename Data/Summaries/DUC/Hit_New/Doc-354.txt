nevertheless, the iraqi formula came close enough to meeting mr. bush's frequent demands for an unconditional withdrawal that the u.s. will find it hard to dismiss it out of hand -- and equally hard to launch a bloody ground war while the proposal remains pending. he'll also want a timetable for withdrawal that would force saddam hussein to leave much of his weaponry behind, as well as assurances that the u.n. can continue pressing iraq to pay war reparations. but mr. bush also now seems caught in the gap between the formal war aims he and the united nations have proclaimed -- which focus narrowly on iraq's withdrawal from kuwait and the restoration of kuwait's rulers -- and the allies' unofficial desire to do away with saddam hussein's regime along the way. the announcement of the peace plan in moscow occurred only hours after saddam hussein had delivered a defiant speech in baghdad in which he seemed to dare the u.s. and its allies to launch a ground attack to drive his troops out of kuwait. saudi leaders, in particular, don't want the war to stop until saddam hussein is out of power because they must share a long, thinly guarded border with an iraq that even now could remain militarily more powerful than the thinly populated saudi kingdom. the broader dilemma is that the proposal forces mr. bush to make a choice he had hoped to avoid: between the prospect of achieving the minimum goal of freeing kuwait without further bloodshed, and the chance to crush president hussein and his military might at the risk of a bloody ground war. by presenting mr. bush with that choice, saddam hussein may not only be posing an agonizing decision but finally taking a step toward splitting the extraordinary international coalition that mr. bush built -- many of whose members will want to accept the iraqi withdrawal and declare victory.
