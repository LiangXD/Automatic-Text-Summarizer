moreover, mr. sununu's ouster is unlikely to result in any major changes in mr. bush's economic policies, which have attracted much criticism recently. but while mr. sununu's resignation may have been personally painful for mr. bush, the president apparently decided it had become necessary to respond to mounting criticism from both democrats and republicans for his administration's handling of the country's economic problems, and to increasing disquiet from his political advisers who were concerned about his slippage in public opinion polls. one administration official noted that mr. sununu was among those who argued most strongly against reopening the fight over a capital gains tax cut this year he argued it would subject mr. bush to unnecessary and unproductive political heat. another administration official, however, said mr. sununu's departure may force mr. bush to get more involved in economic issues. according to several adminstration officials, mr. sununu also encouraged mr. bush to take a firm position on issues where mr. bush had no strong views, such as vetoing appropriations bills for the district of columbia that allowed it to use its own, locally generated funds for abortions for poor women. as a result, mr. sununu became a favorite of many social conservatives who distrusted mr. bush's roots in the moderate wing of his party. mr. sununu began to face rough political waters a year ago when, as one of mr. bush's chief negotiators on the deficit reduction agreement, he bruised congressional egos from both political parties with heavy-handed lobbying and what many saw as disregard for their stature as elected representatives.
