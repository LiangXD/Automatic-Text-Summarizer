president reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and agriculture secretary richard lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government's conservation reserve program. before the drought began damaging crops this month, the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers. it's already getting harder to sell farmers tractors because of the drought, says james k. ashford, case president and chief executive officer. the drought is going to hurt us because it hurts the cattle market, says lance shenold, a vice president of anadarko bank &amp trust co. the land boom is wilting. because of the drought, iowa realtors expect land prices to rise somewhat less than the 5% to 10% they had been expecting. he is hoping that drought damage and rising crop prices will fan inflationary fears so high that land again will be a hot commodity. the decision by mr. lyng, the secretary of agriculture, to allow hay-mowing for 30 days on conservation reserve program land came as farmers and ranchers in north dakota, minnesota and other states continued to sell off livestock in response to shortages of hay and other forage crops.
