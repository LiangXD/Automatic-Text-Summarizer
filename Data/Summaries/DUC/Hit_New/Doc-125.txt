unfortunately, there is the second amendment to the constitution: a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. since the amendment's stated purpose is arming state militias, they reason, it creates no individual right to own a gun. a colleague says that if liberals interpreted the second amendment the way they interpret the rest of the bill of rights, there would be law professors arguing that gun ownership is mandatory. kates expends most energy demonstrating that at the time of the bill of rights, all able-bodied men were considered to be part of the militia and were expected to defend the state if necessary. the phrase right of the people appears four other times in the bill of rights (including the first amendment). kates also marshals impressive historical evidence that the second amendment, like other bill of rights protections, was intended to incorporate english common law rights of the time, which pretty clearly included the right to keep a gun in your home for reasons having nothing to do with the militia. in the supreme court's one 20th-century treatment of the second amendment, it held somewhat ambiguously in 1939 that sawed-off shotguns aren't necessarily protected by the constitution without proof that they are the kind of weapon a militia might have used.
