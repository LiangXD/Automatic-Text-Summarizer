james grogan also told the senate ethics committee he remembers more than one occasion on which cranston or his aides sought contributions from keating while at the same time promising to assist lincoln in its battle against federal regulators. grogan indicated he was surprised by this aggressive appeal for money because keating is a conservative republican who opposes abortion, and cranston is a liberal democrat who is an abortion rights advocate. he said he later persuaded keating to assist cranston by telling him that the senator shared his negative opinion of then-federal home loan bank board chairman edwin j. gray. it was the first of nearly $1 million that cranston solicited from keating -- $60,000 for his campaigns, $85,000 for the california democratic party and $850,000 for voter registration groups founded by the senator. under questioning by special counsel robert s. bennett, grogan detailed the following occasions on which he said cranston or his aides allegedly sought contributions while at the same time pledging to assist keating with regulators: -- in late 1986, when the senate was considering legislation that would have imposed restraints on keating's management of lincoln, grogan tried to contact jordan, cranston's aide on the banking committee, for assistance in battling the proposal. grogan and cranston then discussed lincoln's problems, with keating joining the conversation over the office speaker phone. keating asked cranston to contact then-bank board chairman m. danny wall on lincoln's behalf, and the senator agreed. -- in january, 1988, grogan, keating, cranston, cranston's son, kim, and kim's then-girlfriend, actress shelley duvall, had dinner together at jimmy's restaurant in los angeles.
