mr harry oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls the anglo american corporation of south africa and de beers, is to visit russia next week at a time when the republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamond industry. his visit also comes at a time when the beleaguered diamond industry is rife with rumours about unofficial exports from russia contributing to the present market turmoil which might force de beers to cut its dividend payment this year. however, it admitted that mr oppenheimer would be meeting senior officials from the russian diamond industry during his stay because he would be going to some of the big mines in siberia and would be present when de beers held the formal opening of its moscow office on september 8. de beers' london-based central selling organisation, which controls about 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, in 1990 signed a dollars 5bn, five-year sales contract with the former soviet union and at the same time advanced a loan of dollars 1bn. after the break-up of the soviet union the contract was continued with rosalmazzoloto, the russian gold and diamond organisation, and an exclusive sales agreement was later signed with yukutia, the area in eastern siberia where most russian diamonds are mined and which is now an autonomous republic in the russian federation. diamantaire points out that the russian parliament is to consider next month a plan to set up a state diamond centre under the control of the finance ministry and komdragmet, formerly know as gokhran, the moscow depository of diamonds. observers expect mr oppenheimer to bring his formidable negotiating skills to bear to ensure that de beers grip on the diamond market is in no way weakened by any changes in russia.
