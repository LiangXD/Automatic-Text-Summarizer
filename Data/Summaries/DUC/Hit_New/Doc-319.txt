and in a long interview in icag's offices, milken confirmed that a significant part of icag's business will be with ordinary companies. what we're doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at drexel), in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital, milken says, although he no longer trades or underwrites securities. milken says that helping unions and members of minority groups, and devising ways to help indebted countries, such as mexico, will make up more than half of icag's business. in an off-the-record interview, the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of milken's at drexel and praises milken effusively said that he couldn't afford to have any formal business relationship with icag. milken says his firm expects to help salvage some of the large companies that have been in the news in the last couple of months because of severe difficulties in meeting the payments on their junk debt. when drexel settled a massive sec lawsuit, the firm agreed not to do business directly or indirectly with milken. milken, who was one of the most feared competitors on wall street when he was at drexel, now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and underwriting business that he can no longer do himself.
