ben johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash and it should be awarded to carl lewis, many u.s. track and field officials and athletes said wednesday in the aftermath of johnson admitting to his steroid use. johnson testified this week at a canadian inquiry that his seven-year involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections before the 1987 world championships in rome, where he set the existing world record of 9.83 seconds. i would have to see the evidence, but if he was on drugs at the time of the world championships, my thought would be to remove his record, said ollan cassell, executive director of the athletics congress, the national governing board for the sport. the possibility that johnson could lose his record was raised when the iaaf asked for an urgent legal opinion to see what it could do about records and championships of confessed drug users. johnson, who clocked 9.79 in that race, lost the record and his gold medal, and was barred from competition for two years after testing positive for an anabolic steroid. there was much discussion among athletes competing this week in the tac championships about whether johnson should be allowed back into the sport after he completes his two-year suspension. sprinter harvey glance, a three-time olympian and president of tac's athletes advisory committee, said johnson should be allowed to return after two years.
