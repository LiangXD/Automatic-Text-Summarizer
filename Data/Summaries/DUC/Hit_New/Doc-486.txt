biosphere ii is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural proclivity of water. the water-laden air then is drawn and climbs the mountain where natural cooling and condensing coils bring it down as rain and dew to feed the stream again. the rain forest and its towering mountain and stream are the design of dr. ghillean prance, director of the kew royal botanical gardens of london in association with the new york botanical garden. plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands in biosphere ii. in these areas, where well-defined habitats change, scientists hope to learn how desert encroaches on more productive areas, what happens when fresh water turns brackish, what goes on when climates change. biosphere ii may teach mankind enough so it does not suffer the same fate. biosphere ii may teach mankind enough so it does not suffer the same fate.
