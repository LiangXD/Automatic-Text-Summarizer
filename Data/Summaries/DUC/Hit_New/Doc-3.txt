mad cow disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in britain, is causing trade friction in europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion british beef industry. on friday, west germany joined france in a ban on british beef imports, citing health fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse). concern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject topic a in the pubs and press of britain, and has put a serious crimp in domestic beef sales. the united states does not import british beef and recently rescinded permits for the importation of live cattle. mad cow disease has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 14,000 cows since it was first noticed in the mid-1980s. some experts believe that cattle contracted the disease as a result of eating food contaminated with the remains of sheep infected with a bse-like disease called scrapie. some regulations were enacted to fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: princess anne said her family was still eating british beef.
