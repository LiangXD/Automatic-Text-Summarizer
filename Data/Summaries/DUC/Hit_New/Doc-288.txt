the new madrid (pronounced mad-rid) fault still has 150 small, mostly unfelt, earthquakes a year. we're overdue for one in the 6s and low 7s, says david stewart, an earthquake expert at southeast missouri state university. iben browning, a 72-year-old scientist, predicted october's bay area quake a week before it happened, say people who heard him speak to the equipment manufacturers institute. since 1971, mr. browning says, he has picked the correct dates of four large earthquakes, two volcanoes -- and one day with both a volcano and an earthquake. at that time, a similar quake has a lesser chance of occurring on california's san andreas or hayward faults, according to mr. browning, and an 8.2 quake in tokyo has a greater chance. trying to calm the fear, the national earthquake prediction evaluation council, a panel of academic and government seismic experts, will review the browning claim at a meeting in a few weeks. the group usually ignores claims that aren't scientifically documented (like the one by the california man who said his goldfish helped him predict quakes).
