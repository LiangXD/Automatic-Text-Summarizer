in a voluminous report issued yesterday, the national transportation safety board said these and other incidents carry a clear warning: many foreign-flag cruise ships that sail from u.s. ports have serious safety problems and the potential for a catastrophic accident is significant. foreign-registered vessels make up the vast majority of cruise ships sailing from u.s. ports and catering to americans. diana orban, a spokeswoman for cruise lines international association, a new york-based group that has 35 members, notes that only two people have been killed on cruise ships serving u.s. ports since 1970. ships operating from u.s. ports carried about five million passengers last year, and in anticipation of continued growth, 20 cruise ships are under construction around the world. but the overriding concern, the board said, is that foreign cruise ships are subject to rules that are less stringent and vigorously enforced than those imposed on u.s. flag vessels. but almost all cruise ships operating out of the continental u.s. sail under foreign flags, and the u.s. coast guard conducts only cursory inspections of foreign vessels. at least 80 foreign cruise ships operate out of u.s. ports, mostly from southern florida.
