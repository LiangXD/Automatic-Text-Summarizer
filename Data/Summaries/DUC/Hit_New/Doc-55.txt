this is the question the house of representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the family welfare reform act of 1987. that conclusion was presumably the basis for the bipartisan consensus that was going to produce a serious welfare-reform bill this year. in short, the family welfare reform act amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo. the house democrats' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious. it is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the family welfare reform act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency. at the least, welfare reform should have these goals: to shrink rather than enlarge the welfare system, to ultimately eliminate perverse incentives to remain on welfare, and to make work the focus of the system. by adding several welfare programs to what already exists (without eliminating any), the house bill adds another layer to an already complex welfare system.
