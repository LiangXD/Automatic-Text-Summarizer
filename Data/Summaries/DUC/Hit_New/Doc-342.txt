but the national science foundation, which runs u.s. bases, thinks that the government's commitment to antarctica will wane, what with new restrictions on mineral development and declining soviet competition. this year, after a budget battle, more money was appropriated for u.s. antarctica research, partly by redirecting funds earmarked for housing for the poor. nations realized they needed a base to qualify for membership in the treaty system that governs antarctica, which was up for renegotiation this year. instead, in october, the antarctic treaty nations approved a substitute that bars mineral and oil exploration for at least 50 years and requires environmental safeguards for research bases. of the $193 million the u.s. plans to spend this fiscal year in antarctica, only $22 million is budgeted for science. the countries with the strongest commitment to antarctica may turn out to be the ones that are tied to the continent by nationalism, not science. argentina and chile claim parts of antarctica as extensions of their countries, even though the antarctic treaty effectively makes the continent international territory.
