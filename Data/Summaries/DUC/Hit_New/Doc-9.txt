new cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of creutzfeld-jacob disease, a brain disorder similar to bse. richard lacey, a microbiology professor at leeds university and the leading critic of government policy on bse, said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance. robert will of edinburgh's western general hospital, who has been monitoring cjd in the uk since 1990 on behalf of the health department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with bse-affected herds. one argument put forward by the health department is that cjd has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if bse had triggered any cases of cjd. 'since the illness of the cows (in templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said. the second annual report of will's national cjd surveillance unit in edinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a disturbing rise in incidence: from 32 uk cases in the year ended april 1991 to 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3. most independent experts maintain that no human being - dairy farmer or beef eater - is likely to be exposed to bse in sufficient quantities to develop brain disease.
