in a new wall street journal/nbc news poll, voters were asked whether charges of inappropriate use of government and corporate transportation by mr. sununu are so serious that he should resign. though president bush says mr. sununu's job is safe for now, the ruckus over the chief of staff's extensive use of government and corporate jets and cars has brought to the surface a host of sununu enemies who are likely to keep gunning for his demise. then, just 20% said they had negative feelings about mr. sununu, while 18% reported positive feelings. they canvassed 1,006 registered voters by telephone from last saturday through tuesday, a period when the latest flap over mr. sununu's failure to inform the white house counsel's office accurately about the procurement of a corporate jet he used to attend a chicago fund-raiser was in full swing. the poll's findings are likely to fuel arguments by mr. sununu's supporters that the controversy over his travel isn't being taken as seriously in the country at large as it is inside washington. mr. sununu admitted that he made mistakes in using government planes and his white house car for personal and political business, and he has adopted a low profile. there also is quiet lobbying against mr. sununu by israel's supporters, who long have been suspicious of him because of his links to arab-american groups and his refusal as governor of new hampshire to endorse a proclamation condemning a united nations vote equating zionism with racism.
