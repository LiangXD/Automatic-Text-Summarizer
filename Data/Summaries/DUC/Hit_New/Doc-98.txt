the point at issue in senate debate on a new immigration bill was whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will reallocate house seats among states after the 1990 census. the government made no attempt to count them out in the redistricting process indeed, the two previous administrations decided that the constitution required that the census cover illegal aliens along with citizens. the senate has passed an immigration bill including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the redistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear congress before the next year's national head count. it would give secretary of commerce robert mosbacher the assignment of adjusting the census figures so that illegal aliens don't count for purposes of redistributing house seats. shelby's amendment says only that the secretary is to "make such adjustments in total population figures as may be necessary, using such methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and appropriate" to keep illegal aliens from being counted in congressional reapportionment. the constitution itself says the apportionment of the house is to be determined on the basis of "the whole number of free persons," excluding indians and counting every five slaves as three persons. that was amended after the civil war to say that the apportionment of house seats will be based on "the whole number of persons in each state."
