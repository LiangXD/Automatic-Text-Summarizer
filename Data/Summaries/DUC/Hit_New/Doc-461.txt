just as he said in his article, the reason is that what he has done since he became governor of hong kong has been criticized and condemned not only by china and people of hong kong, but also by people in britain. the most important point of the article is that chris patten was trying hard to explain that all he had done was in the interests of the hong kong people. but for the hong kong people, of course the hong kong chinese, what should be put first is certainly that they should be treated as real chinese people of china rather than a conquered people in a colony, and the first responsibility of britain is to ensure a smooth return of hong kong to china in accordance with the sino-british joint declaration. to the chinese people, the following is understandable: hong kong was plundered after the opium war, a war of aggression launched by britain against china. people will also ask: why will the position of britain in china and asia be decided by how britain discharges its responsibility in hong kong in a dignified manner? if britain ensures a smooth return of hong kong to china in accordance with the sino-british joint declaration, is it not a practice in a dignified manner? does britain really want to return hong kong to china only in name while preserving its position as the governor to show the power and prestige of the british empire and go on playing the tyrant in china and asia as a colonialist?
