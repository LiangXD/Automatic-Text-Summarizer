by many estimates, milken probably achieved that milestone, because by the age of 30 he was a fast-rising star at the fast-rising securities firm of drexel burnham lambert inc., managing its high-yield junk bond operations and reaping huge profits for the firm and himself. managed investments he was very successful in everything he did, whether it was sports or school service or debate, recalled harry horowitz, a milken friend since childhood who followed him to drexel and now serves as a senior vice president there. as a sidelight, milken managed investments for a small group of clients, eating losses himself in exchange for half the profits. after marrying his high-school sweetheart, lori hackel, milken moved to the philadelphia area, where he attended the university of pennsylvania's wharton graduate school of business, becoming one of its brightest students and working part time in the philadelphia office of a precursor to drexel burnham lambert. milken's shrewd trading of junk bonds soon began making millions of dollars for drexel -- and for himself and his band of hard-working traders and salesmen. boone pickens jr., who launched unsuccessful bids for phillips petroleum, gulf oil and unocal ronald o. perelman, who took over revlon, and carl c. icahn, who took over twa -- would displace managements that had grown tired and stale, milken reasoned. although takeovers account for only about a fourth of junk bonds issued, the securities and exchange commission and federal prosecutors charge, among other things, that drexel's junk bond operations engaged in an array of securities violations, including market manipulation, inadequate disclosure, parking of securities to hide their true ownership and other infractions.
