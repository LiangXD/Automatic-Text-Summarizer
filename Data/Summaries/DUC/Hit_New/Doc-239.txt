just try explaining what gatt, the uruguay round or blair house are all about - but us investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the north american free trade agreement: if congress passes the treaty next week, it will be good for the economy, good for us companies, good for the stock markets, and good for president clinton. investors fear that a rejection of nafta would have dangerous knock- on effects around the world, depressing share prices in the us, latin america and eventually europe, and endangering vital trade negotiations over the uruguay round. by coincidence, the day after next week's nafta vote, clinton will be in seattle for a trade conference with leaders of asian pacific nations. investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on nafta would throw such a spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic growth. although the president inherited the trade pact from his republican predecessor, he has invested a lot of his own political capital in getting nafta through congress. share prices in mexico rose on wednesday and thursday, and us stocks made solid gains, following the televised debate on tuesday between vice-president al gore and ross perot, who is nafta's most celebrated opponent. amid all the doubts over the nafta, one thing is certain, trading on markets next week is likely to be hamstrung by uncertainty over wednesday night's vote, which, like the battle over president clinton's first budget, will be extremely close.
