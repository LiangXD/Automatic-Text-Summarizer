"every census since the constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens," added rep. albert g. bustamente, d-texas, termed the worry over counting aliens "hysterical," pointing out that the movement of americans into western and southern states has had a much larger effect on representation than the presence of aliens. tom petri, r-wis. and william f. goodling, r-pa., asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basic right to equal representation by giving greater voice in congress to states where the aliens live. tim valentine, d-n.c., contended that counting aliens "in effect, is granting representation in congress to individuals who have entered this country by breaking the laws of the united states."
