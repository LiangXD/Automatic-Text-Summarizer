workmen tunneling under the english channel have created the first land link between britain and the continent, connecting 31 miles of tunnel in a prodigious feat of engineering and finance. eurotunnel plc, the anglo-french consortium overseeing the world's largest engineering project, plans for high-speed trains to pass through the channel tunnel in june 1993. the tunneling machine on the french side will then guide itself by laser toward the british machine, ensuring perfect alignment. thatcher and french president francois mitterrand will meet mid-tunnel on jan. since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been seven accidental deaths on the british side and two on the french side. the tunnels were joined 13{ miles southeast of folkestone, england, the british terminus near dover, and 10 miles northwest of sangatte, near calais. the tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting for its total length of 31 miles.
