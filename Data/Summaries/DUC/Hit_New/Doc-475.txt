on the face of it, those figures would seem to resolve the age-old debate over whether increases in the minimum wage cost the economy a significant number of lost jobs. no longer does the minimum wage keep all those who earn it above the poverty level: a full-time minimum-wage worker earns less than $7,000 a year, only 80% of what the government considers sufficient to keep a family of three out of poverty, and only 60% of what's needed for a family of four. these days, most of those paid the minimum wage are minorities, women, and teen-agers or young adults just entering the work force, often in service jobs. for instance, a 1970 report ordered by then-labor secretary george shultz found that general business conditions are the main influence on teen-age employment, with only hints of an adverse effect from the minimum wage showing up in the data. in 1981, the staff of the minimum wage study commission, which was appointed by president carter, estimated that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would trim teen-age employment demand by about 1%, and that rises in that wage have had little impact on overall unemployment. opponents of raising the minimum wage insist that past increases have had a substantial effect in both layoffs and disemployment -- workers not hired who otherwise would have been. in return for administration agreement to raising the wage, mr. brock says, congress must also allow a youth differential wage that's lower than the minimum wage, so as not to discourage employers from hiring untrained new job entrants.
