since then, my passion really went up, said fujita, a professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes for 42 years and is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the violent storms. fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the university of chicago creating tornadoes for research. fujita came to the united states from japan in 1953, partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country. tornadoes are very rare in japan, fujita said. fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado. he also developed the fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes. microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, but are more dangerous because they give pilots less time to react, fujita said.
