The Second Amendment was, as was the rest of the first 10 amendments (the Bill of Rights), insisted upon by some of the states for their own protection from the federal government. The Second Amendment stated one of the subjects about which the federal government was prohibited from making any laws. The status of the Second Amendment as a constitutional issue is and has been for nearly 200 years: 1) A restriction on the power of the federal government to limit or deny the states the right to have state militia. 2) Not a federally protected right of individuals.
