The lawmakers who replaced the Communists as leaders of the prosperous northern republic of Slovenia have proclaimed the state's full sovereignty, but stopped short of calling for secession. The media said a joint session of the republic's 240-seat legislature voted unanimously to adopt the Declaration of Sovereignty of the State of Slovenia. Slovenia contains 2 million of Yugoslavia's total population of 23 million. A coalition of center-right parties formed a new government last month in Slovenia, the most prosperous of Yugoslavia's six republics, after trouncing reform Communists in the first free state elections held in Communist-ruled Yugoslavia in 45 years. The republic's new authorities demand that Yugoslavia transform itself into a loose confederation of sovereign states. They threaten that Slovenia will declare full independence from Yugoslavia if the remaining republics do not accept its proposals for a confederation. Yugoslavia, including Slovenia, was created in 1918. The hard-line Communist government in the largest state of Serbia vehemently opposes turning Yugoslavia into a confederation.
