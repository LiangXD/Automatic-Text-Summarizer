That black people, whether free or slave, were not citizens of the U.S.; therefore, they had no standing in court. Well known to most students of race relations is the former attorney general and secretary of the Treasury's pre-civil war dictum that black people being of an inferior order had no right which any white man was bound to respect. Much less known are his equally racist pronouncements denying black people, whether slave or free, specific constitutional protections enjoyed by whites. It was during this period that racial paranoia about black men with guns intensified. It was potent enough to cause the infringement on the Second Amendment to the Constitution's right... to keep and bear arms. This right was restricted or prohibited for serfs, peasants and slaves. Gun control was never an issue in America until after the Civil War when black slaves were freed. It was this change in the status of the black man, from slave to freeman, that caused racist elements in the country (North and South) to agitate for restrictions on guns -- ignoring long established customs and understanding of the Second Amendment. The specter of a black man with rights of a freeman, bearing arms, was too much for the early heirs of Roger Taney to bear. The 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, along with the various Reconstruction civil rights acts, prevented gun prohibitionists from making laws that were explicitly racist and that would overtly deny black people the right to bear arms.
