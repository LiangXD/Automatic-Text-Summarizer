At least four moderate earthquakes rattled parts of the world, but there was nary a tremor Monday along the New Madrid Fault, where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to occur. "This is just a normal day," said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. Along the New Madrid Fault, some schools were canceled and residents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town, just in case climatologist Iben Browning was right. Browning said there was a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake early this week along the fault, which stretches from Marked Tree, Ark., northeast through New Marid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill. "There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said Person, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than 25 years. The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by an earthquake. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said. This fall, there have been two in the New Madrid Fault area, magnitude 4.6 on Sept. Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said. Some people watch precursor activity, but that doesn't always lead to an earthquake. Over the years, he has heard countless earthquake predictions. One woman called daily, alerting Person that an earthquake was about to occur, based on the number of birds that crossed her windshield as she drove down the street.
