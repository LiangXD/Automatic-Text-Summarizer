"The whole place is running at the max, full out," Reed Jarvis of the Boise Interagency Fire Center said last week. "Can you believe it?" she says over her shoulder. In one leg of the L-shaped logistics room, the intelligence division keeps track of fires around the country. A big chalkboard plots the fires as they eat up mile after mile of fuel. "Obviously, firefighting on the line is stressful," said Fire Center spokesman Arnold Hartigan. "But the support people are dealing with human life facing fire, which is inherently dangerous." Hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the Idaho backcountry for days after the last "lightning bust." Three-inch-thick burning branches blew up to two miles ahead of the main fires. National Guard troops in camouflage fatigues march toward trucks for transportation to the fire lines. We're the supply lines for the troops." In the logistics center, specialists spin Lazy Susans with pink and blue requisition forms as each plea from the fire line is answered. They fill up again and again with thousands of gallons of "slurry," a fertilizer-based substance that stops fires cold. It will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the nation's fires. Until then, the lights will be on at the Fire Center, and the pace will be frenetic.
