Forecasters preparing for Thursday's opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict the arrival of new technological help they say may be crucial to ever-growing coastal populations. The Air Force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights for two more years, but has made it clear it plans to phase out the missions. And only one satellite is available for tracking hurricanes. "We're not disputing that the hurricane center and the weather service need the data. There are new satellites on the horizon, says Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters also are worried about a shift in the pattern of hurricane activity in recent years. Since 1985, Sheets said, there seem to be more hurricanes and they're more likely to hit the United States. Max Mayfield, hurricane specialist at the National Weather Service in Miami, said experts don't known enough yet about hurricanes to tell if this is just a peak in activity, or a return to the 50s and 60s. "We'd like to be able to see all the way to Africa," which is where Atlantic hurricanes develop, he said. They really have very little concept of what a hurricane is." Last season, 505 people died in Atlantic hurricanes, including Gilbert and Joan.
