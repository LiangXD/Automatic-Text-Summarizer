In the view of Yugoslav diplomats, the normalization of relations between Slovenia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will certainly be a strenuous and long-term project. A signal that relations between Yugoslavia and Slovenia might be reconsidered came this time from the Slovene capital. Yugoslav diplomats point out that Yugoslavia has not been officially recognized by Slovenia. It is also true that Slovenia does not accept Yugoslavia on the international scene. Yugoslav sources claim that Slovenia is becoming increasingly isolated because of its extreme policy toward Yugoslavia, so that this might be one of the reasons why it has decided to soften its attitudes toward Yugoslavia. After reporters remarked that this relatively negative attitude might negate the unofficial signal from Ljubljana, a Yugoslav diplomat said: We do not think that there is only one opinion in Slovenia about Yugoslavia. Slovenia is the former Yugoslav republic that made the greatest effort to harm the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Belgrade diplomats agree with this assessment and claim that the first announcement of possible contacts between Yugoslavia and Slovenia were made by arrangement with Germany and Austria. Apart from that, Slovenia must stop challenging the continuity of Yugoslavia as a state. There are many situations that prove that Slovenia has a hostile attitude toward Yugoslavia. We are not bothered that Slovenia is an independent state. Slovenia is no exception. We are, of course, interested in normal relations between Slovenia and Yugoslavia, but some prerequisites have to be fulfilled, Jovanovic concluded his statement.
