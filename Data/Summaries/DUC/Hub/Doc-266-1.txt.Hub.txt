Shining Path rebels have formed a new front to push their insurgency into Lima and other coastal urban areas, President Alan Garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded within blocks of the Government Palace. Garcia spoke Wednesday in an atmosphere of stepped up rebel attacks in Lima and a series of weekend raids around the capital that resulted in the seizure of five Shining Path safe houses and 31 arrests. The president, who leaves office July 28, said the newly formed People's Defense Revolutionary Movement, is the "urban, metropolitan organ of the Shining Path." Garcia said he believed the raids proved that "the chief of terrorism actively participates" in Shining Path operations. The raids also proved that the new urban front has been formed, Garcia said: "The people who were captured were essential to the new movement." Two people were injured in the car bombings near the Government Palace on Tuesday night and Wednesday and Garcia called the upsurge in urban violence a "desperate response" to the weekend raids. Guerrillas blew up at least three high-tension power pylons Tuesday night, blacking out parts of the capital and other coastal cities where most of Peru's 22 million people live. Tuesday's car bomb went off behind Lima's Roman Catholic cathedral, which faces the main plaza where the Government Palace is located.
