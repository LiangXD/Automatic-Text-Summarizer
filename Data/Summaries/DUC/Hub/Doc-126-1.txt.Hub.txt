Clearly, the issue at hand is not gun control but, rather, crime control. According to Mr. Gartner, this year about 3,000 teen-agers... will use handguns to kill themselves. The most important fact of all must not be overlooked. Criminals don't care about gun-control laws. Frank T. Iorio Mamaroneck, N.Y. --- As a life member of the National Rifle Association, I agree with Mr. Gartner -- it is not too much to ask for a nationwide seven-day 'cooling-off' period (the Brady Bill) to give the authorities time for background checks. As a law-abiding citizen, it would be of comfort to know that other potential handgun buyers would be screened and keep those with a criminal past from owning a handgun. The reason Washington has yet to enact serious gun-control laws is due to the enormous voting and financial pressure of the pro-gun lobby. James Forbes Atlanta --- It is refreshing to read the actual motives of those who claim they simply want a waiting period for the purchase of a handgun. Mr. Gartner has now made it abundantly clear that his goal is the elimination of handguns from our society. Mr. Gartner ignores the key issues regarding suicide and crime. As evidenced by New York City and Washington, which have the nation's strictest gun-control laws and virtually ban the ownership of handguns by law-abiding citizens, Mr. Gartner's placebo doesn't work because it ignores the root causes of suicide and crime.
