Mad cow disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry. Despite assurances from the British government that the beef is safe, consumers and some scientists remain skeptical. British officials complain that the French and German import ban is a result of economic, not health, concerns. The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the mad cow scare. Therefore, British officials believe, France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. Although other countries have recently placed some restrictions on British beef and cattle, the French and German moves were the strongest by far. The United States does not import British beef and recently rescinded permits for the importation of live cattle. Beef sales dropped, with surveys showing that about a quarter of British households had stopped eating it. Some regulations were enacted to fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne said her family was still eating British beef.
