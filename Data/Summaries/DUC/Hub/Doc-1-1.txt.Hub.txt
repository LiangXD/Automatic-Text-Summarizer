"Mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s. The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement. The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Great Britain in July, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease. The Southwood report said it was "most unlikely" that the disease was a threat to humans. There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that BSE was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.
