1990 is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the nation. So far this year, 726 tornadoes have touched down nationwide, well ahead of the 640 tornadoes recorded during the first six months of last year, and the 30-year average of 482 tornadoes recorded between January and July, said Frederick Ostby of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center here. The nation had 747 tornadoes in the first six months of 1973 _ one of the biggest years for tornadoes since 1950, when the forecast center began keeping reliable records of the storms. This year's storms seem particularly violent, as illustrated by the March 13 tornado that cut a swath a mile wide and brought winds of 300 mph to a field in Kansas. The tornado was the strongest to hit the United States since 1985. The first weekend in June saw the worst outburst of tornadoes since 1974. Ostby said 101 tornadoes touched down from Kansas to Kentucky, leaving nine people dead. Tornadoes have caused 20 deaths this year, while an average year in the 1980s saw 52 deaths, and in the 1970s nearly 100, Ostby said. Flooding in the South and the Plains has been as destructive as the tornadoes.
