Farmers reported 8,581 animals with BSE during the first nine weeks of this year compared with 8,099 in the same period last year. It was revealed this week that Mr Peter Warhurst, a dairy farmer whose herd had a BSE case in 1989, died last year of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. Even so, Dr Will believes that Mr Warhurst's disease was a coincidence not related to BSE exposure. His study has shown no change in the pattern of CJD since BSE started and no other cases among people working with cattle, such as abattoir staff or vets.
