The Trans-Antarctica Expedition Mr. Steger writes about in Crossing Antarctica (Knopf, 304 pages, $25) was born of the ambitions of Mr. Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne, who met in 1986 in the middle of separate arctic journeys. Mr. Steger was leading the first confirmed unsupported dog-sled expedition to the North Pole and Dr. Etienne was making the first solo ski there. Steger and Etienne decided to ski and dog-sled across the continent by the longest possible route, a trek that took them from July 27 until March 3. When I traveled with these men and their dog teams for three days in the Minnesota wilderness in February 1989, it was Mr. Qin's first experience with skis, sled dogs or communicating at length in the English language. None of that bothered Mr. Steger, who was more interested in Mr. Qin's fierce determination to share camp chores and pull his weight in subzero cold. Dahe will do well, Mr. Steger decided, a judgment vindicated over 3,741 miles in windchills sometimes approaching minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Mr. Steger is also a keen judge of dogs, who share equally in the credit for Trans-Antarctica. Because their lives depended on the dogs, the men knew them all intimately, their strengths and foibles. Men and dogs stumbled forward in snowy whiteouts, fell into and rescued one another from crevasses. Bone-chilling head winds froze painful cracks in their fingers and faces, sapping the strength of men and dogs. Within 16 miles of the end, Mr. Funatsu stepped out in a storm to tend his dog team and couldn't find his way back. Mr. Steger is a leader of a different stripe: experienced, laid back, determined and flexible.
