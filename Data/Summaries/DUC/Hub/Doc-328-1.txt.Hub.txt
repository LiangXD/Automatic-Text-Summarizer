WASHINGTON -- Embattled White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, fighting for his political survival, has a rare bit of good news: While Americans generally don't approve of his actions, most don't think he should resign. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, voters were asked whether charges of inappropriate use of government and corporate transportation by Mr. Sununu are so serious that he should resign. That hardly means Mr. Sununu is out of the woods, of course. Though President Bush says Mr. Sununu's job is safe for now, the ruckus over the chief of staff's extensive use of government and corporate jets and cars has brought to the surface a host of Sununu enemies who are likely to keep gunning for his demise. And while voters aren't clamoring for Mr. Sununu's head, they have formed a more negative impression of him. Then, just 20% said they had negative feelings about Mr. Sununu, while 18% reported positive feelings. Mr. Sununu admitted that he made mistakes in using government planes and his White House car for personal and political business, and he has adopted a low profile.
