LAST FRIDAY was the day of the annual agricultural show at Prieska in the northern part of South Africa's Cape Province. This is virtually desert country where a farmer needs several thousand hectares and a drought- and heat-resistant breed of sheep to make a reasonable living. They know him well; for not only is he a neighbouring farmer (his farm is just 170 km away by dirt road and that qualifies as 'neighbour' in this vast hot countryside) but he is also South Africa's minister of agriculture. Mr Kraai van Niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on continued political reform in South Africa, and Prieska is the centre of his constituency. If the voters reject continued reform Mr van Niekerk, along with the rest of the cabinet, will begin preparations to resign. And he claimed that it was not farmers like him, who were used to managing in dry weather, who were in financial trouble. It is, in fact, the arable farmers further east who are suffering most, as I had seen and heard for myself a few days earlier, and Mr van Niekerk has already set up committees of bankers, extension officers and local farmers' representatives, to try to find ways to avoid many of them going bankrupt. But in many cases the financial position is such that the farmer is beyond help. Mr van Niekerk concedes that such suggestions contain an element of truth But the drought is also an established fact and there are socio-economic as well as agricultural reasons why as many farmers as possible should be saved. To allow vast numbers of farms to go out of business at a time when there is little enthusiasm, even among successful farmers for expansion, would put tens of thousands of black farm labourers out of work. Some commentators have suggested that the port facilities are inadequate to handle such volumes within the time available but Mr van Niekerk assured me that his department had done the calculations and confirmed that they can and that imports have already begun to arrive. But back in the Orange Free State, last week, farmers were worrying about the continued absence of any rain to provide moisture to germinate wheat seeds when they were due to be planted in a few weeks time. But in the meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow. Whichever way you look at it this is a crucial time for South Africa.
