The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa's giant De Beers diamond organization. De Beers' Central Selling Organization, which controls 80 percent of world diamond trading, has been based in London for 60 years. The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization because although it is based in London, De Beers is a South African company. A spokesman for the Central Selling Organization said the Office of Fair Trading notified the organization about the inquiry but hadn't yet requested any information.
