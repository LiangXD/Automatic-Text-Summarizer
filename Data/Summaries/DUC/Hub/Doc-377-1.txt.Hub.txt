The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988. Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people. Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit. The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.
