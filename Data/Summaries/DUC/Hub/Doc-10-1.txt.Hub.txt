The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The European Commission planned to tell Germany that it would take legal action if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban, commission officials said yesterday. Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UK after the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK. In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as coming from herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years.
