Less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia to the brink of political chaos. After the shooting of candidate Carlos Pizarro in a jetliner Thursday, the country's largest newspaper implored the government to "do something, for the love of God." In recent interviews, Pizarro, the candidate for the leftist April 19 Movement, or M-19, admitted he was afraid. Pizarro's bodyguards shot and killed the assassin. Two other presidential candidates had already been assassinated during the campaign for May 27 elections. Former president Alfonso Lopez said the assassinations of three candidates indicated that Colombia's armed forces must be reorganized. One of the country's presidential candidates, Alvaro Gomez, said Friday that Barco should name a three-man council to run Colombia's security forces to avoid a military coup. He suggested that Barco had lost control over the armed forces. "Never has there been such a great and pathetic image of anarchy," said Gomez, a presidential candidate of the Conservative Party. Barco, of the Liberal Party, rejected Gomez's suggestion of a triumvirate, saying the armed forces would be reorganized only if necessary. Both Barco and his party's presidential candidate, Cesar Gaviria, have linked Colombia's salvation to constitutional reform.
