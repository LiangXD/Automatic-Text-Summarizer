The plane was flying on a scheduled flight using the internationally established and published Amber 59 airway that is used at least 14 times a week, five of which between the same two airports. USS Vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as American officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai. Possibly the most fallacious argument of the American officials in justifying their inexplicable crime was a claim that the airliner did not respond to the alleged warnings issued by the warship. While every available evidence including the transcripts read earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any warning, many have contended that in such a short and routine flight, the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency civilian frequency. Furthermore, because the ship failed to identify the target of its alleged warnings, the pilot of the airliner of a scheduled flight should not have reasonably taken it as directed against himself. Finally, the most awkward American explanation for shooting down a civilian airliner was presented by Adm. Furthermore, positioning itself right in the middle of an international civil airway, it is ironic that the ship expected the plane to go outside of the corridor, not be coming onto the Vincennes. All available evidence suggest(s) that the shooting down of an Iranian civil airliner... could not have been a mistake.
