Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the winners weren't Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz. Ikangaa, who had captivated New Yorkers last year by winning in course-record time, and Waitz, who had won the race nine times, each ran fourth in their respective divisions. For Waitz, the result was different than anything she had experienced in New York. It was the first time she had finished the race without winning. Since Waitz, of Norway, ran the marathon for the first time in 1978, no American has won the women's division. It was the slowest winning women's time since Waitz's 2:32:30 in 1978. It was Wakiihuri's first marathon in the United States and the third for Panfil, who did not finish the '88 New York City Marathon, after falling near the 16-mile mark and suffering a bruised ankle.
