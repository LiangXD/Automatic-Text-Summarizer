Now, in the wake of that firestorm, local firefighters are looking up at the hills that surround this area and wondering not whether, but only when and where.; I know it's there, said Saratoga Fire Chief Ernest Kraule. 19, the same day Oakland firefighters thought they had contained a brush fire that a day later blossomed into the deadly firestorm.; It's in the mountain communities that straddle Highway 9 in Santa Cruz County, isolated by weak bridges that won't support some firetrucks and connected by a two-lane road that will hinder escape.; It's in Los Altos Hills, where residents in 1984 repealed an ordinance requiring fire-retardant roofs; a year later, a fire destroyed 100 acres and 12 homes, many of which have been rebuilt -- with the same flammable shake roofs.; In fact, the danger of an Oakland-like inferno is in almost all of the hills that ring the South Bay, where homes often are surrounded by dense brush or stately trees, the fuel of rapidly spreading wildfires.; And the risk is increasing, as cramped Bay Area residents push farther into the hills and canyons in search of living space and rural atmosphere. By not trimming dense brush, he said, some homeowners are virtually signing a death warrant. ; And increasingly, fire officials worry about wildfires spreading into even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills, where numerous trees create an urban forest. ; We could have a fire going from rooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city, if the weather conditions are right, said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Osby.; The lesson of the Oakland hills, firefighters say, is to contain and extinguish even the smallest fires as quickly as possible. Now, these communities are the year-round home for thousands, often still dependent on volunteer firefighters and an overtaxed network of roads and water lines.; On a good day, trying to maneuver fire apparatus on those roads is tough, said Steve Cavallero, a battalion chief for the Redwood City Fire Department, which covers a portion of Emerald Lake Hills. Ed Ekers, chief of the Santa Cruz city fire department, worries about sending his trucks through a tunnel of fire if flames were ever to spread across the canopy of trees above Highway 9.; Will there be water?; Even if they can reach a blaze, firefighters know there may not be any water to fight it. In the east foothills and southern Santa Clara County, homeowners have to provide only 5,000 gallons for firefighting, barely enough for five minutes at the rate some firetrucks pump.; To Mike Balesteri, chief of the forestry department ranger unit in Santa Clara County, the lesson is simple: It's either bring your own water or find your own water in our game. ; Taps would go dry quickly; Even when rural communities have upgraded their water systems -- as Redwood Estates did -- firefighters say the taps would start to run low if three or four houses were burning at once.; Local officials say they try to limit fire hazards largely by restricting development in the hills.
