A USA Today/CNN poll of debate watchers found support for the trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had shot up from 34 per cent before the debate to 57 per cent after it. Meanwhile in Mexico the country's Congress launched a fierce attack on Mr Perot and other critics of its political system yesterday, in a furious response to Mr Perot's comments in the debate. The Mexican Congress issued a statement, supported by most political parties, which said: 'We cannot ignore however, that certain judgments expressed, apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country, attack and offend Mexicans. 'The political equation still is going to be that congressmen who vote for Nafta will have to look for other employment next year.' Ms Lori Wallach, an anti-Nafta leader, said Nafta would be won or lost in the congressmen's home districts. The anti-Nafta Citizens' Trade Campaign is bringing 'Nafta Claus' to the Capitol to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell Nafta to a reluctant Congress.
