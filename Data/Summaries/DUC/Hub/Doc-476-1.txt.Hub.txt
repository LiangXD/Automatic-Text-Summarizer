Last year alone, nine states and the District of Columbia raised their minimum wage above the current federal level, and this year New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are considering doing the same. At the same time, if a state's minimum is higher than the federal minimum, the state minimum applies. Moreover, the quoted minimum wage for a state is often deceptive. Some states offer what is, in reality, a menu of minimum wages rather than a single minimum. Moreover, 13 states have minimums below the federal level and nine have no minimum at all. Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05. A minimum wage of $5.05 would require even the high-minimum-wage states of California and Connecticut to increase their mandated minimums by 19%. Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living. Compare these unemployment rates to those of Alabama and Louisiana, states that have no minimum wage. Yet 41 states are still at or below the current federal level.
