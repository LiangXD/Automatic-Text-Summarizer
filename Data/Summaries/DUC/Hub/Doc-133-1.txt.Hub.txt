The tendency is to want to finish the race as soon as possible and get a head start on recovering from it. Patience was its own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday, as the men's and women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take a toll on the runners. Among the women, the race played itself out in a calm, if not orderly, fashion. Run as a race within a race was the Pacific Rim Marathon, which consists of teams from invited countries. Wilson and Yanmin won both the Long Beach Marathon and the Pacific Rim race, for total prize money of $9,500 each. Conditions were excellent at the start of the race, which had its largest-ever field of 4,021 entrants. The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners. Gural emphatically said it was too hot, The sun went to work, was how he put it, and he said he experienced tenderness in his liver during the race. He dropped from third to fifth in the race's final stages. Yanmin had to come from behind for her victory, giving the women's race an exciting finish. As happened in the men's race, the runners in the lead pack ebbed and eventually faded. Guadalupe Roman of Mexico led through much of the race but lost ground steadily in the last five miles and finished sixth. Two Soviet runners -- Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva -- who had run side-by-side in third and fourth place throughout the race, faded. It fell to Konatz, who had been in first and second throughout the race, to hang in there. Asked if she was ever aware of Yanmin during the race, Konatz laughed.
