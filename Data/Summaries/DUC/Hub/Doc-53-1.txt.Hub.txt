In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years. The president correctly sensed that the public wants reform. If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is. The president ought to challenge Congress to respond to his initiatives. Many of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform. The president will need all the help he can get if he is to convince Democrats in Congress to go along. This suggests that the Democrats aren't as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the American public are. The president should take up his case for reform directly with the American people. With the ball in its court, Congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors, or it can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor.
