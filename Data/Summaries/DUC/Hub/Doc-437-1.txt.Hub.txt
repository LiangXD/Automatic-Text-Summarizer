Because of internal government opposition, civil war and an undeveloped infrastructure, delivering food supplies and obtaining accurate numbers are difficult and sometimes impossible, they say.; We know there are places almost out of food, said Rist.; Just as the need is exploding, however, resources of relief programs such as CARE are decreasing, according to reports from the General Accounting Office and the Committee on Refugees.; The United States remains the world's biggest aid donor, contributing more than $250 million last year.
