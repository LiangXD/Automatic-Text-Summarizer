Las Vegas, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and swingers in recent years, is ready for the Southern Baptists. The site represents a marriage of convenience for Southern Baptists and the city built on the vices they condemn. Las Vegas is one of only 15 U.S. cities that can provide the hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention, said Alvin C. Shackleford, a convention spokesman. There are about 22,000 Southern Baptists in 71 churches in Nevada. Six years after the denomination voted to meet in Las Vegas, the decision still evokes controversy, and many Southern Baptists have decided to stay home. Southern Baptists leaders say Las Vegas offers an opportunity to put aside internal battles and emphasize evangelism. "The choice of Las Vegas was deliberate in that the Southern Baptist Convention hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in Las Vegas," said Stan Hastey, executive director of the Southern Baptist Alliance, a moderate group. A series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign Saturday in which about 2,000 Southern Baptists were expected knock on doors around Las Vegas. In addition to bringing in up to $15 million in revenue, the Southern Baptist convention should help the city's image, Powers said.
