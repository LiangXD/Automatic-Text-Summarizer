Gen. Colin L. Powell, 52, won unanimous approval from the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with both Republicans and Democrats hailing him as an outstanding choice. The Senate panel voted 20 to 0 to recommend Powell's nomination to the full Senate. If confirmed, Powell, who would be the youngest officer to head the Joint Chiefs, would replace Adm. 1. The committee action came after several hours of a confirmation hearing at which Powell told the panel that he has some level of confidence that reforms might succeed in the Soviet Union. Expects 'Backward Steps' Reflecting the rising skepticism, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) told Powell: We certainly, I think, have to be prepared for backward steps to occur in the Soviet Union. Echoing praise for Powell, who would be the first black to head the nation's military services, Sen. (D-Tenn.) called Powell's appointment one of the finest appointments that our President has made. Nunn said that Powell offered tremendous... talent, insight, and experience. I have no reservations and I know that none of my colleagues have any reservations, said Powell. Powell told lawmakers that as the President's principal military adviser in a time of shrinking budgets, he would rather have (a force) that is smaller, as long as it's always ready to perform, as advertised, and when called upon.
