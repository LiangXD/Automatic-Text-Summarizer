Psychologists who studied the downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the Persian Gulf say the military needs to better understand stress and should spend more on psychological research and improve its crew training. The judgment of the Navy cruiser crew that mistakenly shot down the Iranian plane July 3 was clouded by misconceptions caused by stress, the psychologists said. The Navy said crew members, under battle-caused stress after just finishing a firefight with Iranian gunboats, misread or misinterpreted a variety of electronic data from the Aegis computers. Dr. Richard Nisbett, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan, noted that the Vincennes crew was on alert for an attack by Iranian planes. The crew members interpreted the data to see what they expected to see, he said. The Vincennes crew wanted to avoid another incident like that involving the Stark, Nisbett said. Dr. Richard Helmreich, a psychology professor at the University of Texas, said the Vincennes crew members didn't communicate among themselves well enough.
