New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a brain disorder similar to BSE. Richard Lacey, a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leading critic of government policy on BSE, said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance. He believes that BSE can trigger human brain disease. The official view is that the deaths are an unfortunate coincidence, even though it is statistically unlikely that two dairy farmers should contract a disease as rare as CJD. Robert Will of Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, who has been monitoring CJD in the UK since 1990 on behalf of the health department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with BSE-affected herds. One argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD. 'Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said. 'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.' The second annual report of Will's National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a disturbing rise in incidence: from 32 UK cases in the year ended April 1991 to 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3. Veterinary experts say that almost all of the 102,000 confirmed BSE cases so far can be attributed to scrapie-contaminated feed. Or - in the case of BSE - it may arrive from another animal.
