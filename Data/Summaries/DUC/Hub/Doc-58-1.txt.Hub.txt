President Bill Clinton's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it' was one of the most popular lines in last year's election campaign. By promising radical welfare reform, Mr Clinton was sending a powerful subliminal message: he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban society. In addition, the administration promises to bolster the economic position of welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to support their children financially. But they are hardly going to solve America's welfare problem, which differs substantially from that in Europe. Those whose welfare benefits expire will face a stark choice: accept low-paid employment or hand over children for adoption. With its economic life support system (welfare) ripped away, the underclass will shrivel. If welfare stops, something has to take its place. After two years, welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer of a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage. According to one advocate, this would amount to replacing the welfare state by the 'work ethic state'. But it would involve a huge expansion of public sector employment and cost perhaps Dollars 50-60bn a year, far more than the Clinton administration is willing to spend on welfare reform. This recognised the impossibility of ending welfare overnight and instead set targets for the gradual introduction of 'workfare'. These seemingly undemanding targets require a much larger fraction of the welfare population to take jobs at some point during the year. Mr Clinton could tighten the definition of 'employable', so as to include mothers with children under the age of three, and set more demanding workfare participation targets, for example that 50 per cent of welfare recipients should be working or in training by the year 2000.
