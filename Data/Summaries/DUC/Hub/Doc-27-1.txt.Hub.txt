Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong. It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year. Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said. An officer encountered Barnes, unarmed, in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, standing in his bedroom, police spokesman Sgt. Barnes made "a kind of lunging motion," and the officer fired from about 5 to 8 feet, Mills said. Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar and whether he would have lunged at the officer. "We are defending the officers being in that apartment," Mills said. Both clergymen alleged racism; Bishop suspended some of the officers involved in the May incident. And an officer killed a man who was spraying him with a fire extinguisher. No officer involved in the two killings was charged. The officer who shot Barnes was a two-year veteran of the force. "This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr. Barnes' family and for this officer," Bishop said. "The officers were reacting appropriately to a number of circumstances which together led them to that apartment."
