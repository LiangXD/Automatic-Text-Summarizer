"In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB has increased dramatically," the CDC said, noting that in New York state there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seven times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78. The CDC's Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis is recommending TB testing for most new prison inmates and staff members _ with the possible exception of inmates just transferring through for less than a week. The spread of AIDS-virus infections may play a part in the spread of TB in prisons, the CDC said. AIDS tests should be offered to all inmates with known TB infections, the CDC report said.
