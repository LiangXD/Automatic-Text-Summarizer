Legal experts differed sharply in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over what impact Judge Robert Bork's free-market approach to antitrust law would have on competition and consumers. A wide array of anti-competitive practices which have been specifically outlawed by statute or (by) settled Supreme Court precedent would be rendered lawful if Judge Bork's antitrust views held sway, New York Attorney General Robert Abrams warned yesterday, as the committee concluded 12 days of hearings on the Supreme Court nomination. Meanwhile, President Reagan launched a new, more vigorous campaign on behalf of Judge Bork's nomination, which is losing momentum. Robert Packwood of Oregon, the only Republican senator to publicly oppose the nomination so far, said he knows of between three and five other Republicans who may oppose Judge Bork. He added: They're pretty experienced and tough and may be able to withstand White House pressure to support Judge Bork. Cranston said on Tuesday that he estimated 49 votes against Judge Bork, 40 in favor and 11 undecided. The 60-year-old Judge Bork, a federal appeals court judge, is a recognized expert in antitrust law. In yesterday's testimony, Robert Pitofsky, dean of Georgetown University Law School and a former Federal Trade Commission member, said Judge Bork advocates an antitrust program more conservative than proposed by almost anyone else. Mr. Kauper said there isn't any reason to assume Judge Bork would overrule antitrust precedents or federal laws and that Judge Bork advocates an antitrust approach designed to promote consumer welfare. He said the vote on Judge Bork will be a crossroad of conscience for the Senate. Mr. Reagan maintained, as the White House has for months, that Judge Bork's philosophy is in the mainstream of contemporary thought. But the president also emphasized, in stronger terms than previously, his view that Judge Bork would be a law-and-order justice who would aid the fight against crime.
