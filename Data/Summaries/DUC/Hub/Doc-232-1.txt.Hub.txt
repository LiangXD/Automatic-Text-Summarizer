His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs, and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico. Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congress to vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Nafta approved by Congress this year. Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as a weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to Mexico. Governor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of Nafta'. The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared its ground well in the House. In the Senate, Nafta is threatened by a resolution introduced by Senator Don Riegle, which would permit Congress to amend the agreement in five areas. 'If the Riegle resolution gets through,' said one business lobbyist, 'we might as well kiss Nafta goodbye.'
