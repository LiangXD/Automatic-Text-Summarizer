A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the Richter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today, the U.S. Geological Survey says. 17. The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today, or 5:05 p.m. It was the largest earthquake in the Solomons since a 7.4 quake on Nov. Major earthquakes in the Solomons usually don't cause much damage or many casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not extensively developed. That places the earthquake just east of San Cristobal, the easternmost island in the Solomons chain and about 1,300 miles northeast of Brisbane, Australia. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
