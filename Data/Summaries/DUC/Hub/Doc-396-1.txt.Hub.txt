The announcement of the lawsuit came on the eve of the July 3 anniversary of the 1988 tragedy, when an Iran Air Airbus was shot down by the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf. Vincennes crew members said they mistook the airliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter coming in to attack. "and other entities which designed and manufactured the radar equipment on board the USS Vincennes." Ghafoor said the complaint charged that the radar equipment indicated the aircraft approaching the Vincennes was an F-14, diving in an attack mode at an altitude of 4,000 feet, rather than the Iran Air flight, which was climbing. He did not mention any figure for the compensation sought but said the group would be guided by the amount of compensation the Iraqi government paid the families of American sailors killed in an Iraqi air strike on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf on May 16, 1987. Iraq has agreed to pay $27.3 million to the families of 37 U.S. crewmen killed aboard the Stark, meaning each family would receive around $740,000.
