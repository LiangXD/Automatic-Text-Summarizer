Men who smoke heavily are nearly twice as likely as nonsmokers to die from a common form of leukemia, concludes a report by the University of Edinburgh. Dr. Kinlen, who directs the university's Cancer Epidemiology Unit, examined leukemia deaths from a U.S. study that had tracked veterans' smoking between 1954 and 1969. The earlier study tallied overall deaths from various causes, including 723 deaths due to leukemia. Dr. Kinlen found veterans who had smoked more than 21 cigarettes a day were the most likely to die from myeloid leukemia, the most common form of the disease in middle-aged people. For this reason, leukemia has in general not been regarded as a a malignancy related to smoking, Dr. Kinlen wrote. Leukemia is fairly rare.
