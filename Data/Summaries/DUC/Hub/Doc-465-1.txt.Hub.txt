The researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's production of interferon, a disease-fighting substance, may play a role in warding off the development of cancer. The researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as regulators that stop the body's cells from becoming cancerous. Some genes, known oncogenes, are though to trigger cancer. Cancer can also occur when other genes, known as anti-oncogenes, are missing. The production of two forms of interferon, known as alpha and beta-1, are controlled by two genes that are close together on chromosome 9 in the body's library of genes.
