The focus of the drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most areas, the National Weather Service reported Thursday. Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the Great Lakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency's Climate Analysis Center reported. In addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. The drought region now extends well into West Virginia and includes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky and Tennessee, the weather service drought advisory said. The drought has been accompanied by higher than normal temperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western Great Lakes region. However, in the Midwest, the weather service reported that large areas have experienced the driest April-June period on record since 1895. Reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation, however, the weather service noted.
