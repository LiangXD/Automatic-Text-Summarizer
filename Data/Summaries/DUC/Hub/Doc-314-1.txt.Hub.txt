Michael Milken, who faces insider trading charges, is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made "junk-bond" financing into the tool of choice for corporate raiders. In so doing, Milken, 42, transformed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from a minor player on Wall Street into a powerhouse and in the process made himself feared, respected and enormously wealthy. The 184-page civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York against Milken, Drexel and others on Wednesday followed months of speculation about Drexel's involvement in the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal. It was business as usual at Drexel, and Milken was still king of the junk bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate takeovers. In anticipation of a crisis, Drexel undertook a public-relations campaign starting last year to polish its image, stressing the role of junk bonds in helping small companies and downplaying their role in large takeover battles. In the years before the insider trading scandal, the financial media wrote glowingly of Milken. Milken reportedly pulls down $40 million a year as the head of Drexel's junk-bond operation and his personal fortune has been estimated at more than $500 million. At age 10, while other boys were giggling over comic books, Michael Robert Milken was enamored of money. Drexel merged with Burnham &amp; Co. in 1973 and Lambert Brussels Witter in 1976 to become today's Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Milken's job was moved to New York. In 1977, he pulled off a coup by convincing Drexel to let him move the company's junk-bond operations from Wall Street to Beverly Hills, just off swank Rodeo Drive. Milken was enormously successful in that regard, almost single-handedly building a close-knit network of junk-bond investors. The corporate players come to him.
