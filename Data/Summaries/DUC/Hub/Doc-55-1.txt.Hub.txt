How much more of an investment should American taxpayers make in the welfare system? This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987. The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients. The proposed new spending on welfare should be viewed as an investment, say its proponents, led by Rep. The bulk of the new money would go to higher AFDC pay-outs, extension of mandatory benefits to two-parent families and maintenance of certain benefits for welfare recipients earning some income. In short, the Family Welfare Reform Act amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo. In fact, while the level of AFDC benefits has decreased in real terms since 1970, the total level of all welfare benefits has not. The House Democrats' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious. It is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the Family Welfare Reform Act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency. The House bill doesn't do that. By adding several welfare programs to what already exists (without eliminating any), the House bill adds another layer to an already complex welfare system. By further increasing rather than gradually reducing the level of benefits available to recipients, it makes welfare more, not less, enticing.
