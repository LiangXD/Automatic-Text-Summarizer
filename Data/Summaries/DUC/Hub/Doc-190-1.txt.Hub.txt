In July he said there would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of which six would be hurricanes. Comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel with the number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Mr. Gray found a striking correlation. From 1947 to 1969, for instance, rainfall in the western Sahel was especially abundant, and during this time there were 13 severe hurricanes that formed in the Atlantic Ocean. From 1970 to 1988, the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought, and hurricane activity was unusually low; only one severe hurricane, Gloria in 1985, formed in the area. He found that the Sahel was especially wet from 1870 to 1900 and from 1915 to 1935. Hurricane activity was much higher during this time than during intervals when the Sahel was dry.
