This helps explain the strong momentum for limiting lawmakers' terms, a sentiment fueled by the recent disclosures of the House banking and restaurant fiascos. Term limits would accomplish few of their proponents' goals -- more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists. But the threat of term limits or of electoral defeat focuses even the narrowly self-interested mind. The nexus of many of the problems -- entrenched arrogance, more concern for powerful interests than average citizens and the obscene preoccupation with campaign contributions -- is the committee system. A powerful antidote would be to limit committee service, which would have few of the political and constitutional drawbacks of term limits. While both men are deeply dismayed at the current state of Congress, they see term limits as a cure worse than the illness. Term limits really hit at democracy, says Prof. Fenno. This really would challenge these guys to shake up the system, says Mr. Fenno, noting that the power of interest groups is centered in committees. Mr. Ferris believes this would put a vitality in the system while not resulting, unlike overall term limits, in a bunch of neophytes who'd be more dependent on staff and lobbyists. Mr. Ferris notes that the current system, in which a lawmaker gets a cherished committee assignment in his first or second term and then stays there for the rest of his tenure, breeds staleness. If lawmakers had to change areas of expertise every three or four terms, they wouldn't have the luxury of being intellectually lazy. Currently, the Intelligence committees in both houses and the House Budget Committee limit members to six or eight years. Why shouldn't the Commerce committees and the tax-writing and appropriations panels be subjected to the same limits?
