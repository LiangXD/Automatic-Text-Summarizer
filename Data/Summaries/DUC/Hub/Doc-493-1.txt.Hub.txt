Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to become the nation's top military officer. "I am ready to go to it and I look forward to the challenges ahead," Powell said. Powell, who served as national security adviser in the final year of President Ronald Reagan's administration, will succeed Adm. 30. Bush praised Powell, a decorated veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam, as "a complete soldier" as well as a distinguished scholar. "Colin Powell has all those qualities and more." Powell fits the mold of Bush's national security advisers, like-minded pragmatists who favor consensus-building rather than confrontation. Such abilities will be essential when Powell is called upon to deal with the intense rivalries that can afflict the Pentagon. Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have outweighed his military experience. He's had experiences few can match," said Robert Sims, a former Pentagon spokesman who knew Powell when he served as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's military aide. Powell currently is commander of the Army Forces Command in Fort MacPherson, Ga., responsible for the combat readiness of 1 million troops on active, reserve or National Guard duty. Along with his predecessor as national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, Powell was credited with helping the Reagan White House recover from the Iran-Contra affair. Powell served in Southeast Asia as an adviser to South Vietnamese units in 1962 and 1963 and as executive officer of an infantry battalion and as a division operations officer in 1968 and 1969. Holder of a Purple Heart for being wounded in combat, Powell also won the Bronze Star for valor.
