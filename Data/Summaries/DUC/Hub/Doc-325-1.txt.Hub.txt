It was Sununu's first appearance on a network program since revelations in April about his extensive use of government planes for activities ranging from visiting his dentist to skiing to trips to his home state of New Hampshire.; On Sunday, Sununu gave the same explanation for using the government car that he had offered for using government planes -- that he must be able to communicate instantly with the White House in the interest of national security.; Sununu has been unable to fly on government planes for personal business since Bush instituted new travel rules after the April controversy.; Sununu since has asked sponsors of political events at which he is to speak to obtain corporate jets to take him to and from Washington. Party officials in three states where Sununu has made recent appearances said they, not the White House, asked corporations to provide him planes.; Sununu and Edward Rogers, his top personal aide, flew to Des Moines Tuesday night on a corporate jet arranged by the Iowa Republican Party so Sununu could address a fund-raising event, according to Randy Enwright, the party's executive director.; Because of all the flak, we wanted to make sure we did it right, he said. We ran this by the White House to make sure the company didn't have any business pending there. ; The Kirke-Van Orsdel insurance company in Des Moines furnished the plane, Enwright said, and the state party was to pay the firm about $2,000, the cost of two round-trip, first-class commercial tickets.; The New Jersey Republican Party arranged last week for Beneficial Corp. of Peapack, N.J., to charter a plane to fly Sununu here after a fund-raising appearance there, according to party spokesman Bill Ulrey.; After his personal business in New York last Wednesday, Sununu had gone on to New Jersey for the fund-raiser, while his driver returned alone to Washington.
