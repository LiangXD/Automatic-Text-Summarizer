Dickey, who was testifying under subpoena, admitted under questioning that the black man, Don Jackson, never used profanity during the arrest as Dickey had indicated in his report. Dickey also admitted that he intended to inflict pain on Jackson when he put handcuffs on him as a way to control him. Dickey has been temporarily reassigned to a desk job, and Jackson was charged with interfering with a police officer. Boatwright questioned whether the car in which Jackson was riding was actually weaving -- the stated cause for the traffic stop -- and whether Jackson acted aggressively toward the officers, as Dickey said in his report. Dickey acknowledged that the police car he was driving was weaving all over, too as it tailed Jackson's car. Also, Jackson alleged, officers refused three requests to loosen his handcuffs as he was taken to the police station. Dickey's eight-page police report, which was provided to reporters, states that Jackson was arrested for saying offensive words, an allegation that was later dropped. But Dickey conceded at the hearing that it was he, not Jackson, who uttered obscenities. No Taunts Heard The report states that Jackson challenged the officer to fight, although Jackson never is heard taunting the officer on the tape. Dickey said that he was swearing to try to alleviate his fear. At one point in the proceeding, Boatwright had Dickey and Jackson weighed in an attempt to show that Jackson is shorter and weighs less than the officer. At another point, Boatwright assumed the role of Dickey and had Dickey play Jackson in trying to demonstrate the type of hold Dickey used on Jackson during the arrest. Boatwright contended that in using that type of hold the officer would have had to push Jackson into the window deliberately. The officer said Jackson's face crashed through the window when Jackson suddenly pulled forward. Jackson, according to Dickey, struck the window with his elbows and not with his face as Jackson contends.
