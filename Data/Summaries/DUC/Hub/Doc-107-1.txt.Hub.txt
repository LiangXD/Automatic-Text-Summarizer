A split, charred tree stump is a clue that lightning was to blame for a forest fire. "You eliminate all those causes, you're down to arson," said Dale Smallwood, a criminal investigator for Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest. Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwood said. A total of 14,200 acres of the forest, which covers 1.5 million acres mostly in southern Missouri, were burned during a spring fire season made more volatile by drought. On average, Smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires each year in Missouri are deliberately set. He said Mark Twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem. As one of the Forest Service's 125 special law enforcement agents, Smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigating fires in the forests he loves. The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set. The Forest Service has attempted to counter the lore that can lead to burning. But the tradition of using fire to manage the woods dies hard. And they don't necessarily have to be mad at the Forest Service. Then, "fire is used as retaliation." Then, "fire is used as retaliation." McDonald, who oversees about 125 Mark Twain employees trained as firefighters, said forest fires cost $25 to $30 an acre to suppress. Last year, a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the Forest Service. "An arson case in the forest is very hard to make," he said. Beyond the cost in dollars of forest fires, there's risk to those who fight them. "We had an employee die of a heart attack fighting an arson fire," Smallwood said, referring to a 1976 blaze.
