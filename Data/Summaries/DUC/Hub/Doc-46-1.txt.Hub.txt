A tornado blasted through this North Florida town before dawn today, destroying several homes and a college library, blowing off rooftops, flipping cars and leaving four people dead and 15 injured, officials said. The tornado passed only four blocks from her office. Two of the deaths occurred in mobile homes blown apart by the tornado, and four other houses were seriously damaged as well, said Madison County Civil Defense Director Bernard Wilson. Trees, roofs and mobile homes were damaged, and at least six other injuries were reported. As far as his office knew, all the damage was from one tornado, Peavy said. He said the tornado's sweep through town lasted under 30 minutes. Two tornadoes struck near the towns of Malone and Bascom, about 100 miles to the west of Madison, said Jackson County emergency management director John Mader. Three homes and a trailer were destroyed and five homes seriously damaged, he said, and two people were slightly injured. The lightning accompanied a tornado that moved through southern Houston County about 60 miles northwest of Tallahasse. In the eastern Georgia's Bulloch County, six mobile homes and one house were heavily damaged shortly after dawn today, but no injuries were reported, the weather service said. Tornado watches were still in effect across 14 southeastern Georgia and 15 northeastern Florida counties until at least five hours after the tornado hit. Madison County has been hit by seven tornadoes since 1959 with only one injury reported, according to the National Weather Service.
