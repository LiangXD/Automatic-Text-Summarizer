President Quett Masire of Botswana said Thursday that industrial nations can help relieve drought and hunger in Africa by reducing global warming caused by the greenhouse effect. Masire and Dr. Bernard Ledea Ouedraogo, an anti-hunger organizer in Burkina Faso, were honored as co-winners of the 1988 Africa Prize for Leadership for their efforts in averting hunger. A severe drought gripped much of Africa from 1981 to 1987, killing millions. Experts believe that due to the organizing efforts of Masire's government, not one person died of drought-induced famine in Botswana. By the time the drought ended, malnutrition had actually declined. In his acceptance speech, Masire thanked Western donor governments and private agencies for their help during the drought, but suggested drought and hunger will get worse in Africa if the Earth's climate keeps warming.
