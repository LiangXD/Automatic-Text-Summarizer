A 66-year-old physician, a botanist and a marine biologist were among four men and four women picked today to spend two years inside a 2\-acre sealed dome intended to be a microcosm of Earth. Biosphere II will resemble a space colony tethered to Earth. Sprinkled into the ecological stew will be 3,800 plant and animal species. The only link between the dome's ecological system and Earth will be electrical power transmissions, as well as computers and telecommunications.
