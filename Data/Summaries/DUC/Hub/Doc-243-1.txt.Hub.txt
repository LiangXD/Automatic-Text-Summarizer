The government of the northern republic of Slovenia said Friday that Serbia, in the south and east, is attempting to "oust us from Yugoslavia." The statement from the Slovenian presidency followed Serbia's decision Tuesday to ban all political and economic contacts with Slovenia. Liberal, prosperous Slovenia and the hard-line communist leadership of Serbia have been feuding for years. Slovenia issued an order Tuesday banning the rally and Serbia reacted by severing relations with Slovenia. In its statement, Slovenia's collective presidency called Serbia's action "a flagrant violation of all constitutional, legal and civilized norms." Serbia is the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics. It was yet another attempt to bring Slovenia to its knees."
