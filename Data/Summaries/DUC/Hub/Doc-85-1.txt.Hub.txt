Tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988, as compared with 1985, but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6 percent among Hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higher rates of AIDS cases. In 1988, 7,720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites, compared with 8,280 in blacks and 3,637 in Hispanics. The TB rate among blacks was 28.3 per 100,000, compared with 18.3 for Hispanics and 4.1 for whites. But the number of new cases is only part of the toll from tuberculosis, the CDC said. Tuberculosis, which is curable in most cases with drug treatment, killed 1,755 Americans in 1987.
