And he wasn't even named John Sununu.; But the rise and fall of Sherman Adams, President Eisenhower's powerful chief-of-staff, is more than an interesting political doppleganger to the travails of his lineal heir, John Sununu. The case of Sherman Adams sheds an eerie light on Sununu's rise in the ancient, stony soil of New Hampshire politics. And the course of Sherman Adams' humiliation may even allow us a perspective on the course of John Sununu's struggle for survival and possibly even a way to predict the timing of his ultimate demise.; That Sherman Adams, the first assistant president and John Sununu, conceivably the last of the imperial chiefs of staff, were both catapulted from governor of the Granite state into national prominence is not at all coincidental. In 1940, at the behest of his employers, he ran for a seat in the New Hampshire House, eventually becoming governor in 1949.; When he took office, Adams began a program of streamlining and reducing state government that provided a model followed three decades later for another new New Hampshire governor, John Sununu.; In late 1951, New Hampshire was the launching pad for the campaign of Dwight D. Eisenhower.; Eisenhower, with Adams' support, defeated the isolationist Sen. Without Sununu, the chances are very good that the current president of the United States would not be named George Bush.; In February 1988, a reeling Bush campaign limped into New Hampshire after finishing a near-fatal third in the Iowa caucus. That ploy, plus a computerized get-out-the-vote campaign, crafted by Sununu on his own spreadsheet program, did the trick, and the rest is history.; Unlike Sherman Adams, John Sununu could not be mistaken for a rock-ribbed Granite Stater. The Wall Street Journal noted that Sununu became an extremely powerful figure in a state where the powers of governor are not great. ; More or less the same thing could have been said about Sherman Adams when he gave up the New Hampshire governorship to become Dwight Eisenhower's assistant president in 1953.; The reason for Adams' enormous power lay in the nature of the Eisenhower presidency. It also meant that Adams would decide who and what crossed the president's threshold. When pressed about Adams, the president insisted that he was his right-hand man... the only man who really understands what I am trying to do. And when really pressed about why he kept Adams on, Eisenhower wailed at a press conference, I need him. ; In 1958, an Eisenhower administration without Sherman Adams was unthinkable. Certainly more unthinkable than a Bush administration without John Sununu. The year 1958 was the beginning of the Democratic renaissance that led to the election of John Kennedy in 1960.; Today, as Vice President Dan Quayle could tell you, John Sununu is no Sherman Adams. Sununu is as brash as Adams was self-effacing and far more self-serving than Adams at his vicuna-coat worst.
