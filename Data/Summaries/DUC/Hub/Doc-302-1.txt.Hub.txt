Smith and the pilot, Charles Vierling, who also was killed, were flying from Hattiesburg to Gulfport, according to federal and local officials. There was a 300-foot-long path cut by the plane, Harrison County Sheriff's Department Capt. Smith, 45, died the same day the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep. Leland's plane had been missing almost a week after he took off on a fact-finding mission to combat hunger. News of Smith's death was followed by an outpouring of sympathy from Mississippi to Washington, even as Smith's colleagues were still mourning Leland's death. Smith, a former sheriff and police chief, was already developing a reputation on the House Judiciary Committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs. The plane belonged to the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies Inc. in Gulfport. The institute immediately issued a statement saying that Smith had requested use of the plane to accommodate his busy schedule. Jody Canady, a spokeswoman, said Smith was to reimburse the institute. The statement said the plane, manufactured in 1973, and purchased by the institute last year, had a current inspection. Smith was elected last November to represent Mississippi's 5th congressional district. He was Harrison County Sheriff from 1984 to 1989, and was Gulfport police chief from 1977 to 1983. Gaston, who worked for Smith nine years both in the sheriff's department and earlier when Smith was Gulfport police chief, called Smith a pillar of strength.
