A U.S. military jet crashed today in a remote, forested area in northern Japan, but the pilot bailed out safely and was taken by helicopter to an American military base, officials said. Vanedoe's home town was not immediately available, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Isao Teranagare, spokesman of Iwate Prefecture (state) Police, said the pilot was taken by a Japanese rescue helicopter to the U.S. Air Base at Misawa in northern Japan. In that crash, the pilot also bailed out and was rescued by a helicopter.
