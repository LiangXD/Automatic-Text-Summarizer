Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun. The solar eclipse in Finland starts at 4:03 a.m. The total eclipse begins at 4:52 a.m. in Helsinki and will last 83 seconds. After the total phase of the eclipse, the moon will move away, uncovering more and more of the sun. The eclipse ends at 5:45 a.m. in Helsinki. In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon. At Joensuu, 310 miles northeast of Helsinki, the sun will be 5 degrees above the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers. Some eclipse viewers won't have to worry about the clouds, because they will be above them. The last total eclipse to be seen in Finland occurred in 1945.
