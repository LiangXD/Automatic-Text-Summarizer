Botanist Linda Leigh, who has spent the last three weeks literally in her element, called her stay in an experimental biosphere a success Wednesday but said she's ready to return to Earth. Ms. Leigh has been living inside a test module for Biosphere II, a $30 million project under construction. "The one thing that I really do miss is just companionship," Ms. Leigh said Wednesday in a telephone interview from within the module, located on a ranch about 30 miles north of Tucson. 2, Ms. Leigh has been in frequent daily contact with her outside support team by telephone, video conference, two-way radio and just looking through the glass windows. Two people also check her psychologically each day, Ms. Leigh said, "just to make sure that my state of mind or humor is normal." Her colleagues serenaded her with "Happy Birthday" by video and directed her to gifts hidden in her living area. Samples are passed through a special port for outside analysis, along with samples of waste water and her urine. The rest of the waste water is fed into a marsh recycling system. Ms. Leigh said she hasn't felt isolated because her support team is excellent.
