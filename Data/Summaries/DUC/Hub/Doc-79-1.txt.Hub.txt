A U.S. Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed today in Saudi Arabia, killing both crew members, U.S. military officials reported. An Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet also went down that day, killing both crew members. The aircraft was attached the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath Air Base in Britain. The wing was sent to Turkey as U.S. forces massed in the region in response to Iraq's Aug. In addition to those killed in Saudi Arabia, 13 other Air Force personnel were killed in a crash of a C-5 jet cargo plane in Germany. That aircraft was ferrying supplies and equipment to the Saudi peninsula.
