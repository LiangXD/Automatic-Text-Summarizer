1. Abandoning his from politics to politics stance, which is that politics is self-justifying and self-sufficient, Patten has now woven politics into the lives of the people of Hong Kong, making it part and parcel of the local way of life and inseparable from the war on corruption, the rule of law, freedom, education, and the quality of governance -- all perennial concerns in Chinese society. [passage omitted] Now Patten takes life in Hong Kong as his point of departure, arguing that democratic politics of a high quality are what the people of Hong Kong need to maintain the Hong Kong system. How to sever the linkage between politics and the Hong Kong way of life? When Hong Kong fought for democracy in the 1980's, Xu Jiatun [6079 1367 1470] tried countering Hong Kong's capitalist primary democracy with advanced socialist democracy. Subsequently China rejected Hong Kong's political demands by questioning their timetable. After Patten came to Hong Kong, the Chinese could no longer keep acting anti-democratic. Now that Patten has made politics an integral part of the life of the Hong Kong people and their institutions, can the Chinese continue to counter it with the argument that it is all a matter of trust between nations? He hopes that as it advances with big strides into the 21st century, Hong Kong will be like a beacon, shining brightly as if to announce its glorious achievements. It was so severe and threatening that it gave the impression China was prepared for mutual destruction, with Britain, Hong Kong, and itself all going down the tube. Even as public approval of Patten slipped and opposition rose, anti-Chinese feelings in Hong Kong also gained ground. 3. Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council is replete with praises for the people of Hong Kong, for their accomplishments, and for the superiority of the Hong Kong system, calling it a miracle of human society. Having inherited the tradition of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, the Chinese Communists have always considered Hong Kong alien land. It is hard for the Chinese to sing the praises of the Hong Kong system, Hong Kong people, and Hong Kong society. What Patten said about Hong Kong's values and its superiority were all satirized by the Chinese media, so much so that one could hardly tell right from wrong anymore. In so doing, however, they in effect repudiated many of the values of the system of Hong Kong. If China continues its negative attitude toward Hong Kong, what sort of price will it have to pay? If, on the other hand, it echoes Patten and begins heaping praises on Hong Kong and emulating the Hong Kong system, can the Chinese Government bring itself to do that? Would praising Hong Kong send a wrong message to the local people, misleading them into thinking that China would compromise with Patten and go along with him? Would that encourage Hong Kong chauvinism? Hong Kong people hope that something will come out of their talks. A dozen or so public opinion surveys by the Hong Kong Statistical and Business Research Council invariably came up with one finding: The people of Hong Kong want both sides to make concessions and reach an accord. One year after arriving in Hong Kong, Patten has certainly commanded much authority with his solid political ideas. Patten makes endless allusions to what is good about the Hong Kong system and what is bad about the Chinese system, one obvious example being the way the two governments level with the people. Even more striking is the open dialogue and debate that took place in an atmosphere of freedom between Patten and the people of Hong Kong on an equal plane after the governor presented his second annual report (in which the Chinese authorities also played an active part). He spent a lot of time emphasizing the close ties between China and Hong Kong and the numerous connections between the two, including cooperation in administrative matters and environmental protection. Sino-Hong Kong relations mean China learning from Hong Kong's value system and success story and Hong Kong drawing support form China's strengths. Patten said, When many places in the world identify with Hong Kong's value system and seek to duplicate its success story, would the world become a better place, a more prosperous place? (Section 182) Patten took the initiative to define the relations between China and Hong Kong, giving substance to their contacts as well as clarifying the nature of such relations. Hong Kong represents progress and as such should be imitated; China represents power and should therefore be a source of support for Hong Kong to tap into. China has always looked at Hong Kong unilaterally from top to bottom, demanding that it fall in line with China and not the other way round. The kind of Sino-Hong Kong relations China wants is one in which Hong Kong complies with all China's orders and satisfies every Chinese demand. As for making the Hong Kong system living, automatic, and autonomous, the relations between China and the special entity of Hong Kong, how the two should be integrated and to what extent, as well as the costs and benefits of such integration... none of that has been considered at length. A major incompatibility in Sino-Hong Kong relations is that the sovereign body, namely China, is large but backward, whereas Hong Kong, which has no sovereignty, is small but advanced. A unilateral emphasis on China's sovereignty would result in integration of a regressive type, meaning that an advanced Hong Kong would have to reach down to accommodate a backward China. A one-sided emphasis on Hong Kong's non-sovereign status is both impossible and disastrous. 7. In his annual report to the Legislative Council, Patten noted subtly and not so subtly that where Hong Kong was free to make up its mind, things had gone well in the past year, but where consultation with China was necessary, nothing seemed to have worked well. In Section 172, he said....outstanding achievements have been scored on all fronts during the past year...with one lone exception, which was Hong Kong's effort to further its understanding with China and replace unproductive speculation with sincere trust. Not because of a lack of effort, a lack of determination to improve bilateral relations on Hong Kong's part. (Section 174) The reason is that we still have not been able to convince Chinese officials that Hong Kong citizens' expectations about the development of their political system are in no way excessive but are reasonable and should be met, that they form part of the natural evolution of a society as it matures and becomes more sophisticated. In a certain sense, political development is also a prerequisite for Hong Kong's remaining a leading player in international trade. The people of Hong Kong might blame the Chinese Government for the delay in solving all those problems that need to be tackled urgently. How to undo the damage the delay has caused Hong Kong and China (particularly Guangdong)?
