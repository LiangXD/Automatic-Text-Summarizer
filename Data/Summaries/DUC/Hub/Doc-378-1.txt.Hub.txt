Japanese workers at U.S. Navy bases are protesting a policy that requires workers who deal with confidential matters to submit to lie-detector tests. The union asked the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, which hires Japanese workers for the bases, to urge the U.S. to drop the polygraph requirement. The Navy briefed the workers on the tests in April. The accuracy of polygraph tests is widely disputed. About 500 Japanese base workers are subject to the lie-detector test, the spokesman said.
