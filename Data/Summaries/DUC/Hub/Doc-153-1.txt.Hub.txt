Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today "in a complete state of shock," accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal. "Everybody uses drugs," said sprinter Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone. It is just an itty-bitty drug. "If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again, my brother is not on drugs," she said. Two tests of Johnson's urine sample proved positive and his denials of drug use were rejected today. In a middle-of-the-night meeting with Olympic and Canadian officials, family members, coach and manager, Johnson, 26, forfeited his most prized possession, the medal he'd had in his hands for only three days. "Ben was not able to discuss or articulate anything at that moment... It's also a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians." James Worrall, a Canadian member of the IOC, said Johnson "has been killed" as an athlete. "I feel sorry for Ben and for the Canadian people," he said today. He said he did not want "to fuel this controversy" by commenting further.
