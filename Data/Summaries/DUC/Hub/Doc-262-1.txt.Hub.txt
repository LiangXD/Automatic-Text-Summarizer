Police captured the top military leader of the Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war has taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said Monday. Officials said the capture of Osman Morote, 43, considered the most radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to date for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the Andean highlands in May 1980. "Osman Morote is considered the No. "For some Shining Path experts, Morote might even be, in practice, the true leader of the organization." Palacios said police had suspected Morote was in the house. He said Morote put up no resistance. Morote, known within the rebel band as "Comrade Remigio," is second in importance only to Guzman, who founded the Shining Path as a splinter group of the Peruvian Communist Party. Guzman is the ideologist of the organization, but Morote is considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military. Guzman, Morote and other Shining Path leaders went underground in the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war, which has claimed more than 10,000 lives.
