An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise ship off the Mexican coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze and the ship with 715 people aboard was towed to port. "The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the Mexican navy to Cancun," said Diaz. The Scandinavian Star was on a 3-day cruise to Cozumel, Mexico, and was returning to St. Petersburg when the fire broke out about 1 a.m. The fire was already extinguished when the Vigilant arrived about 10 a.m., he added. Ms. DeChello said the company did not know what sparked the fire. In August 1984, a fire struck the Star's sister ship, the Scandinavian Sun, in the port of Miami, killing a passenger and a crewman.
