The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the last six hurricane seasons. Those years brought just two to five hurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985. "It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season," Gray said in a paper presented to the conference. Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually occurred. In 1984, when there were five hurricanes, Gray had predicted seven.
