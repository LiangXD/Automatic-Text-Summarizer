A grand jury's questioning of a polygraph expert who is helping investigate the bombing of Pan AM Flight 103 indicates the Justice Department's probe is entering a new phase. A federal grand jury in Washington heard testimony last Friday from James Keefe, a polygraph expert for a security consulting firm hired by lawyers representing Pan Am in a civil suit over the Dec. Keefe testified about giving polygraph tests to three Pan Am baggage handlers in Frankfurt, West Germany, during his appearance before the grand jury, said a source familiar with the case. Keefe told the panel two of the three baggage handlers failed the polygraph tests when they said they knew nothing about the transfer of a piece of luggage to Flight 103, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Polygraph tests cannot be admitted in court, but the questions Keefe asked the baggage handlers and their responses may provide investigators with new leads in the case.
