An official statement issued Friday confirmed that federal military commanders met in March and considered ways to quell dissent in Slovenia. The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followed reports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina that there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic. The ministry statement said the federal military council met on March 25 and concluded that "dissident tendencies" in Slovenia were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's Communist government. The statement did not identify the foreign elements and said Slovenia police later challenged the claim that there was such a conspiracy. Slovenia's Communist Party presidium also "expressed disagreement with part of the military council's opinions," said the statement. It published a letter to Slovenia's Communist Party leader Milan Kucan from two student unions that said military action had been planned earlier this year, including the arrests of "nonconformist journalists, writers and officials."
