Yasser Arafat on Tuesday accused the United States of threatening to kill PLO officials if Palestinian guerrillas attack American targets. The United States denied the accusation. There have been accusations by the PLO that the United States knew about and approved plans for slaying Wazir. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States has been in touch with a number of Middle Eastern countries about possible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities. "It has come to our attention that the PLO leader Yasser Arafat may have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks against American citizens and facilities abroad, possibly in retaliation for last month's assassination of Abu Jihad. We would hold the PLO responsible for any such attacks." "These attacks will then be used to justify the assassination of PLO leaders." He strongly denied that the PLO planned any such attacks.
