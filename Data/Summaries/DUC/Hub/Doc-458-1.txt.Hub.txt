CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with Beijing. Analysts in Hong Kong said it also amounted to a bid by China for greater involvement in the colony's administration. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese government, in a dispatch released through the Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, said that all contracts, leases and agreements signed and ratified by the Hong Kong government would be invalid after June 30 1997 unless they were first approved by China. It added, however, that China encouraged foreign investment in Hong Kong. In London, the Foreign Office rejected Beijing's threat, saying it was contrary to the 1990 Basic Law for Hong Kong.
