The airplane was attempting to land at nearby Coronado Airport, Porter said. Walter Ramazzini Jr., 17, of Albuquerque, said he was sitting about 100 yards from the airplane when it crashed. "He was going east, making a left turn from the airport," Ramazzini said. To correct for that, he banked right and he kept going and passed level flight as if to turn right," Ramazzini said. "To correct again for that, he went again to the left... and went nose-first into the ground," said Ramazzini, a student pilot. The airplane "wasn't very high _ maybe 100 feet," Ramazzini said. "We went up there and there was nobody alive," Ramazzini said. We were looking for fire extinguishers." He said the witnesses thought the airplane might blow up, so they retreated.
