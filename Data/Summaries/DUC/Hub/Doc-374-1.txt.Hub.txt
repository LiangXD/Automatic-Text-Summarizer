A major earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter scale struck off northeastern Honshu Island early today, officials said. The agency said the quake had a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale, the same as the Oct. In Washington, the U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured 7.3 on the Richter scale. The main earthquake was the strongest in that region in more than 58 years, since a magnitude 7.7 earthquake March 9, 1931, said Don Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. agency. The strongest of the earlier quakes was a magnitude 6.5 on Sunday. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a "major" earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a "great" quake, capable of tremendous damage.
