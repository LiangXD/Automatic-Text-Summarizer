It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis. The agency estimated that between 15 million and 20 million adults will be infected with HIV by the year 2000, and it predicted that the number of cases and deaths from tuberculosis will rise sharply as a result, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the U.N. agency. An individual does not have to have a damaged immune system to contract an active case of tuberculosis. But when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as it can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect numerous others. But if they're not treated for tuberculosis, those people will be spreading the disease (tuberculosis) in their communities. You don't have to have a depressed immune system to get tuberculosis. This year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United States is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases. The overall incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is 9.5 cases per 100,000 population, he said.
