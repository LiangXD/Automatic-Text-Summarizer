Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) -- The Sunday Review television program said that according to a very reliable source, the end of the popular war, the surrender of weapons, and a general amnesty, would be the main points of a peace agreement without victors or vanquished, between the Shining Path and the Peruvian Government. According to the Sunday Review program, directed by journalist Nicolas Lucar on the Lima America Channel 4 Television Network, the 10-point agreement says its main aspect is to stop the popular war with its four forms of fighting: terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and armed agitation and propaganda. So far, government authorities have not denied or rejected the accuracy of this agreement between the government and Shining Path.
