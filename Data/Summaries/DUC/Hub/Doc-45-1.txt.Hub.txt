"People should have plans of what they'll do in tornadoes. In mid-November, 11 people died in East Texas when a series of tornadoes trashed towns from Cherokee County to the Gulf Coast. One is to know the difference between the tornado watches and tornado warnings issued by the weather service. A watch means weather conditions are suitable for development of a tornado, and people should keep a careful lookout for potential funnel clouds. A tornado warning means one has already developed and has been spotted. James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for Disaster Research at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly try to outrun tornadoes in their cars. During the 1979 Wichita Falls tornado that killed 53, McDonald said, "people jumped in their cars and drove down Main Street at 90 mph." Twenty-six people died while trying to outrun the twister.
