Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982. Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research. Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953, partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country. Tornadoes are very rare in Japan, Fujita said. It's a beautiful thing, Fujita said. Forecasters still have trouble predicting tornadoes. But Fujita has helped define the conditions most likely to spawn them. Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado. He also developed the Fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes. Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, but are more dangerous because they give pilots less time to react, Fujita said. Fujita retires from teaching this year, but will continue his research at the university. In Texas one time, five people were killed when they drove right into a tornado. They just didn't know any better, Fujita said.
