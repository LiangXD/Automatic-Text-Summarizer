After years of debate, court rulings and federal legislation, use of the polygraph has dropped sharply, despite supporters who insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a lie. "They have been useless and give misleading information," said Leonard Saxe, a visiting professor of psychology at Brandeis University and a leading opponent of polygraph testing. Last week, the state Supreme Court banned lie detector tests from being introduced as evidence in criminal trials. The court, noting polygraph studies have shown success rates varying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent, said: "There remains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraph testing to detect deceit." The court was not alone in deciding against polygraphs, which attempt to determine someone's honesty by their physiological response to certain questions. The federal law, which took effect a year ago, has taken a big bite out of the polygraph business. However, these trends do not mean polygraph testing is dead. The Department of Defense uses polygraph testing to search for spies, and also to screen job applicants if something suspicious arises in background checks, said spokesman Jim Turner. Many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if both the prosecution and defense agree. New Mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a polygraph examination as evidence, with the trial judge deciding whether the tests meet certain standards. "Jurors are very cautious with polygraph evidence. They do not ignore other evidence and concentrate on the polygraph."
