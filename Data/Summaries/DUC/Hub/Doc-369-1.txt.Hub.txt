Robert H. Bork, who once hoped for a Supreme Court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court Monday. The Senate rejected Bork's nomination to the high court in 1987 after a bitter political battle. Bork was treated much the same as any attorney who appears before the justices. Bork was only the sixth man this century to be denied a Supreme Court seat by the Senate and the 26th in its history.
