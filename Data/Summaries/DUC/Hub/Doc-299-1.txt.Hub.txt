About two hours before yesterday's crash, the National Weather Service in Colorado Springs issued its first high wind warning for the area since January, according to James Hall, a meteorological technician observer in Colorado Springs. Moments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23 miles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, Mr. Hall said. A Federal Aviation Administration official said, There were some reports of gusting winds but whether or not that had any impact or whether there was any kind of mechanical problem, I can't speculate. Another FAA official said that although it is too early to pinpoint the cause, wind shear would be a major area of investigation. If preliminary reports that there was wind shear in the area are true, then that would indicate there was some instability in the atmosphere, he added. Wind shear is a sudden, violent shift in wind direction. However, he said that wind shear is most dangerous when an aircraft is flying at a very low altitude, either shortly before landing or right after takeoff. The last major U.S. wind shear accident occurred in Dallas in 1985, when a Delta Air Lines jet crashed on approach. Since then, the FAA and the industry have revamped pilot training on wind shear and have devoted considerable resources to dealing with the hazard. The jet involved in the crash is almost nine years old.
