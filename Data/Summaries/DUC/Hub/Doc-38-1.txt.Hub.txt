With some people having booked trips as long as three years in advance, airline seats, rental cars and hotel reservations range from difficult to impossible to get, travel agents and others report.; The closer you get to the event, the less there is available, said Paul Kloetzel, president of O'Brien Travel Service in San Jose. There is a certain element of traveler out there (and) there's an awful lot of those people. ; The eclipse will be seen from Hawaii to central Brazil. The sky will grow darker, as if dusk has fallen, until the sun is completely blocked out for a few minutes as the moon's shadow falls on the earth. The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico's west coast. It really is the most spectacular natural phenomenon possible. ; Bob Bruynesteyn, head of the San Mateo Astronomical Society, puts it succinctly: Not too many people have stood in the shadow of the moon. ; It's romantic images like these that are inspiring a last-minute surge of would-be eclipse-watchers, travel agents say.; Pamela and Daniel Dei Rossi of Campbell were among those scramblers. Learning of the eclipse only a month ago, they began calling travel agents. She called a friend in Hawaii for a place to stay, but airline ticket and rental car problems still loomed. She called a travel agent who had taken a class with West Valley College astronomy instructor Tom Bullock. But after enveloping the Big Island and then slicing across southern Baja, the moon's shadow will cross the Gulf of California and race across the southern flank of Mexico and down the west coast of Central America. With the eclipse, there's concern the overbooking could be particularly bad, especially on inter-island flights in Hawaii. Special Mylar viewers for safely observing the eclipse are also available for another $2.
