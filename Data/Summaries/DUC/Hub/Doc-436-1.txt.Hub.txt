Testifying in Mr. Keating's court challenge to the takeover, Mr. Seibold said lots of documents -- loan and credit files -- were missing when an FDIC team swept through Lincoln's offices in Phoenix, Ariz., April 14, 1989. In sorting out what belonged where after the takeover, Lincoln's files were returned to Lincoln's building. Mr. Keating also said that Lincoln was required to keep all original loan files at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. Henry Gonzalez, who made Mr. Keating something of a celebrity with his hearings on Lincoln last year, called for the Justice Department to freeze the assets of Mr. Keating and other highflyers who have defrauded savings and loans. He prefers his kangaroo court, Mr. Keating said.
