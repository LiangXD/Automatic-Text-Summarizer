IRAQI President Saddam Hussein has sought to tighten his grip on power by turning over key government roles to trusted family members.; He has also taken steps to portray Iraq as committed to democratization by:; (check) Holding autonomy talks with Kurdish leaders.; (check) Abolishing the secret Revolutionary Court.; (check) Easing restrictions on travel and news organizations.; (check) Promising to hold elections and disband the ruling Revolutionary Command Council.; Threatened by the revolts of the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south, as well as rumblings in the army, he has closed his circle around him.; Since Iraq's defeat, Saddam has adjusted his Cabinet twice, shifting the portfolios of longtime senior officials and promoting others known for their loyalty to him.; On the surface, the reshuffling looked as if he were moving to democratize.; In March, for example, he relinquished the title of prime minister and gave it to Saadun Hamadi, a Shiite who has held several important positions in the Baath government.; Personal loyalty seems to be the litmus test for Saddam's new appointees:; (check) His cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, is minister of interior.; (check) His half-brother, Sibawi, retains direct control of the intelligence services.; (check) Son-in-law and former bodyguard Hussein Kamel al-Majid is his minister of defense.; Publicly, Saddam is seen on Iraqi television presiding over meetings of the Revolutionary Command Council and visiting villages, and he has promised his people to rebuild the country scores of times better than what the allied forces destroyed.; But most experts see Saddam's efforts as aimed at reviving relations with the outside world and at relieving some of the pressure at home. Only the autonomy talks with the Kurds are considered serious.; IRAQ; MONTHS OF SANCTIONS ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL; IRAQ'S economy was severely damaged by the war, and the trade sanctions imposed by the United Nations shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August are starting to take a toll.; Iraq is allowed to import food and medicine under the sanctions. They must in turn sell the goods at high prices to make a profit.; An ambassador from a Third World country, who spoke on condition of anonymity, predicted that if the sanctions were continued six more months it would increase the threat of internal unrest in Iraq.; President Bush has said the sanctions will remain as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. The damage is everywhere: in air, water, earth and fire.; Smoke and soot continue to pour from hundreds of oil wells set ablaze by the fleeing army of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.; KUWAIT; WAR-RAVAGED NATION IS SLOW TO REBUILD; KUWAIT is lacking in leadership, stripped of its workforce, gutted of supplies and apparently in little hurry to do anything about it.; Hundreds of homes, shops, offices, schools and power plants have been looted -- but not leveled. About half the old workers were foreigners, especially Palestinians, who either fled the country during the war or have been ordered by the Kuwaiti government to stay off work because of alleged Iraqi sympathies. Heavy lifting and sweeping up are the sort of menial tasks previously left to Filipinos and Bangladeshis, most of whom left the emirate after the invasion.; In fact, of the nearly 1.5 million foreigners who lived here a year ago, only about 250,000 remain.; Shortages of basic supplies such as water, electricity and hotel rooms have hampered efforts by Western companies to make contacts and sign contracts.; Last week, the government announced the extension of martial law for another month, and the prime minister ordered a crackdown on armed vigilantes who have been rounding up foreigners suspected of collaborating with Iraqi occupation forces.; The government itself has contributed to the tension, holding the first trials of alleged collaborators and handing out harsh sentences for apparently trivial crimes.; Western diplomats predict the regime may face an uprising if the ruling Sabah family fails by year's end to call elections for a new parliament.; THE U.S. MILITARY; HIGH-TECH WEAPONS, NEW WAR PLAN WORKED; THE Pentagon's fascination with sophisticated weaponry appears to have won a ringing endorsement, thanks to the convincing victory over Iraq. About 20,000 other Shiites are living in a camp in Saudi Arabia.; In all, roughly a quarter of Iraq's 19 million people were either routed from their homes or lost their jobs as a result of the gulf war, according to estimates from several relief agencies.; In the first major assessment of the war, the environmental group Greenpeace reported last week that as many as 221,000 Iraqi people died as a result of the war and its aftermath. That toll includes: 100,000 to 120,000 Iraqi troops; 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians; 20,000 Kurdish and Shiite insurgents; and 15,000 to 30,000 refugees.; And a team from Harvard University recently visited Iraq and forecast that more than 170,000 children will die in the coming months from disease and war-related traumas.; BURNING WELLS; 500 FIRES STILL RAGE ON KUWAITI OIL FIELDS; Crews capped the 100th well last weekend in the smoke-darkened gloom of Kuwait's blazing oil fields, about 20 wells ahead of schedule.; Oil experts and firefighters are now predicting that at least half the 500 oil fires still blazing could be out by the end of summer.; The four companies fighting the fires estimate that it will take 13 more months to put out all the fires -- a much shorter amount of time than had been feared when the world first glimpsed the awesome spectacle of Kuwait's 600 burning oil wells.; The current pace of two wells per day is expected to slow in the coming weeks, however, as crews turn their attention to the most badly damaged wells. Those could take up to a month each to control.; Badly damaged wells will have to be redrilled.
