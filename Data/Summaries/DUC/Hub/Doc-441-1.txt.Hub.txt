'Only God can help us through this crisis,' said the Afrikaner preacher called to provide spiritual guidance to South Africa's farmers, who have been hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory. Agricultural economists point out that drought years are more the norm in South Africa than the exception. But Mr Koos du Toit, chief economist of the South African Agricultural Union, says it is the worst drought he has ever seen, and the most widespread. Mr du Toit endorses comparisons with 1933, a highly emotive year for Afrikaners because of the numbers forced off the land by drought. None the less, Pretoria is understood to be contemplating substantial drought aid for farmers: several hundred million rands, or perhaps as much as R1bn (Pounds 200m) over two to three years. Without such aid, the Maize Board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de grace. Real gross domestic product has been forecast to rise by 1.5 per cent this year, though that figure could prove much too optimistic if the worst drought predictions are borne out.
