Terry Anderson spent a fifth birthday as a hostage today, a grim milestone in his captivity. The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, made up of colleagues from all over the United States, wrote: "Please believe that not a day passes when we do not think of you and pray for you." The Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan said it was sending a 33-foot birthday scroll to Anderson signed by 59 journalists and former colleagues in Tokyo. Anderson was a member of the club during a working assignment in Japan 1979-1981. Gunmen seized the 42-year-old Anderson in Moslem west Beirut after a game of tennis that had been a brief respite from his reporting on Lebanon's civil war. Anderson's fate now appears to be caught up in a power struggle between Shiite Moslem radicals and moderates. Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985. Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the whereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon. Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year, reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for their comrades jailed in Kuwait. Anderson and Sutherland are among eight American hostages, most believed held by pro-Iranians. Since he was kidnapped, Anderson has been allowed to write a few letters to his family and occasionally to see Lebanese newspaper and television reports about relatives. Released hostages said he did not know of the deaths. Anderson knows his daughter, Sulome, was born June 7, 1985, but has seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed him to watch on Lebanese TV, according to letters from him released by the kidnappers.
