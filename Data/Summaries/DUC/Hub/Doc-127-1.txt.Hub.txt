Mr. Goldwin's mistake stems from his having confused a necessary with a sufficient condition. The Second Amendment, in its language and its history, makes plain that the need for a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition for the right to keep and bear arms. Yet Mr. Goldwin treats it as a necessary condition, which enables him to conclude that Congress could deny an individual the right to own a gun if he did not join the National Guard. The right of the people to serve in the militia. Yet Mr. Goldwin believes the amendment means, as he later says, that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the militia. Thus does he reduce the first of these rights to the second, when clearly it is much broader. Roger Pilon Senior Fellow and Director Center for Constitutional Studies CATO Institute Washington --- The militia is not the National Guard but rather the people of the original states. In Ohio, we have an Ohio militia that is not a part of the National Guard. Thomas Jefferson moved to prevent this type of power in a few people's hands by the Second Amendment. Samuel R. Bush III Cincinnati --- Let those who want guns join the National Guard, says Mr. Goldwin. I ask who are the militia? he said, and then answered his own question with the words: They consist now of the whole people (emphasis added). Further, a 1903 U.S. law defined the militia as not only the National Guard, but all able-bodied males between 18 and 45. Edward F. Menninger Sterling Heights, Mich. --- Mr. Goldwin suggests gun control via enlistment in the National Guard.
