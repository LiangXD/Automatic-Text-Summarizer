Not until early Sunday morning did Beatriz Martinez, 29, cross the U.S./Mexican border to register for, then reach the starting line of, the San Diego International Marathon on East Mission Bay Drive. Two hours, 16 minutes and 12 seconds later, in only his second marathon -- his first was this event last year when he finished eighth -- Beatriz Martinez crossed the finish line 39 seconds ahead of South African Mark Plaatjes, now of Lake Forest, Ill. It was the first marathon Rollins has completed this year, after dropping out of the New York City Marathon four weeks ago in mile 18 because of stomach cramps. Beatriz Martinez and Rollins received $5,000 each for their victories. And for Beatriz Martinez, who ran cross country for San Diego City College in 1988, he might as well have won the lottery. Castillo was entered in the accompanying half marathon, but he and Pedro Casillas missed that races' turn at just over the mile mark and mistakenly followed the longer route. But Plaatjes said it was because he and Casillas, who eventually dropped out at mile 18, were so far ahead of the lead pack of Plaatjes, Danny Bustos, Dick LeDoux, Kurtis and Leodigard Martin. The first time we caught them was at 18 miles. Bustos of Las Vegas, N.M., led for the first 14 miles, followed closely by Plaatjes, Beatriz Martinez and LeDoux. But Beatriz Martinez took the lead at 23 miles and Plaatjes couldn't close the gap. Rollins and Ireland ran together for 11 miles until Kathy Smith of Irvine took the lead for miles 12-17. Best decided late Saturday to run the marathon, but dropped out after 18 miles...
