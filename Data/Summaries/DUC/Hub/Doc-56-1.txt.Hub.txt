President Reagan warned Saturday that he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him that does not contain a work requirement. "But there are still some Americans whom our expansion has passed by _ those caught in the welfare trap," he said. "Now, Congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare reform and I have a message for them," he said. "I will not accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people independent of welfare." "Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform," the president said. "Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary, but those requirements should be controlled by state and local officials who administer our welfare programs, not federal bureaucrats," Downey said.
