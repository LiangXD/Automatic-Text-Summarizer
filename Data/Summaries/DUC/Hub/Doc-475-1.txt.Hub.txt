Between 1978 and 1981, Congress raised the minimum wage four times. On the face of it, those figures would seem to resolve the age-old debate over whether increases in the minimum wage cost the economy a significant number of lost jobs. Higher wages... for some will mean jobs lost for those workers who are trying hardest to break into the labor market, warns GOP Sen. The labor federation notes that since World War II, employment actually increased each time the minimum wage was raised, except in the 1975 recession. The advocates of a higher minimum wage say increases are necessary to offset lost ground. In 1968, the minimum wage was about 53% of the average hourly wage of a manufacturing employee. Now the minimum amounts to only 34% of the average manufacturing wage. Opponents of boosting the wage floor argue that it is these jobs that are most at risk. That is exactly what raising the minimum wage will do. That is exactly what raising the minimum wage will do. In 1981, the staff of the Minimum Wage Study Commission, which was appointed by President Carter, estimated that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would trim teen-age employment demand by about 1%, and that rises in that wage have had little impact on overall unemployment. Opponents of raising the minimum wage insist that past increases have had a substantial effect in both layoffs and disemployment -- workers not hired who otherwise would have been. The minimum wage has no bearing on what we do -- it's a forgotten issue, he says. In return for administration agreement to raising the wage, Mr. Brock says, Congress must also allow a youth differential wage that's lower than the minimum wage, so as not to discourage employers from hiring untrained new job entrants. He is also pushing to exempt small business from the wage-floor requirement, and wants legislators to drop a provision that after 1990 would tie the minimum wage to average manufacturing wages.
