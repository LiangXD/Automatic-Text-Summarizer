In the type of leukemia suffered by the patients, white blood cells have turned malignant at an immature stage of cell development. The acne drug is believed to trigger these immature but malignant cells to divide and mature and then die essentially a natural death. This new concept of triggering cancer cells to mature and die contrasts with the conventional concept of chemotherapy, in which drugs simply poison malignant cells. It is an uncommon cancer, afflicting about 1,000 Americans a year, in which certain cells in the bone marrow become malignant before they have matured into fully functioning white blood cells. The malignant, immature white cells (known as myelocytes) flood the blood stream, producing fatigue, fever, weight loss and bleeding. This and other laboratory findings suggested that the immaturity of the leukemic white blood cells might somehow be related to a foul-up in the way the cells handled or failed to handle retinoic acid. The nature of the genetic damage also hinted that doses of retinoic acids might prod the immature malignant cells to proceed to maturity and then die as normal white blood cells do.
