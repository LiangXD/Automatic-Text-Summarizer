The Las Vegas Hilton currently claims the title with 3,174 rooms but will be surpassed next March when an expansion is completed at the Flamingo Hilton, giving that Strip resort 3,530 rooms. Steve Wynn's Mirage Hotel opens next month with 3,054 rooms. The Riviera Hotel currently has 2,200 rooms but a planned expansion will give the resort 3,800 rooms by June of 1992. The number of rooms at the Hawaiian property is not expected to change in the near future because the hotel recently completed an expansion, according to Las Vegas Hilton spokesman Bruce Banke.
