The new drug was developed at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., where doctors tested it on patients with hairy cell leukemia. Hairy cell leukemia affects the white blood cells that make disease-fighting antibodies. The Scripps doctors concluded that the medicine, called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA, "may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia." In their study, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients. Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed in recent years.
