At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributed among the states on the basis of population. "If both sides get their way, the only change would be a flip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia," said William O'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent Population Reference Bureau. The only change, he said, would be that California would gain five new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two rather than just one. O'Hare's study of potential changes in House seats _ based on 1990 projections with no adjustments _ calls for California to be the big gainer, adding six House seats, followed by Florida with a gain of four and Texas adding three. Expected to pick up one seat each are Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona.
