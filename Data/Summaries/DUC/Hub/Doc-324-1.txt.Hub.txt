Mr. Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff, is a combative, conservative Republican with a history of ambushing liberal Democrats like Sen. Mr. Sununu was typically tough; at one point, he tracked down Sen. In the end Mr. Sununu committed the White House's support to the legislation while winning some concessions to minimize the effects on small business -- and a mutually acceptable bill now is whisking through Congress. His boss, President Bush, is enjoying high public approval, important legislation is moving ahead and Mr. Sununu's relationship with the president is strong. Many political analysts here believe that Mr. Sununu has moderated his brash style, and that the former governor has adjusted to his White House role.

Mr. Sununu suggests that sometimes when he knocks heads he does so because it's part of the job of being the top aide to a president who doesn't like to knock heads himself. One group Mr. Sununu has generally succeeded in pleasing is conservatives, who view him as their champion in a generally moderate White House. Mr. Sununu does appear ready to move in when he thinks conservative principles aren't being followed adequately. But Mr. Sununu rejected that advice, ordered up a lengthy statement reiterating Mr. Bush's opposition to abortion, then read the statement personally to reporters. And whatever his relations with others, Mr. Sununu's most important relationship -- the one with President Bush -- appears sturdy. And Mr. Sununu is comfortable enough with Mr. Bush to pull an occasional practical joke.
