A five-man U.N. team arrived in the Iranian capital of Tehran today to investigate the downing an Iranian jetliner by a U.S. warship. The International Civil Aviation Organization team planned to start its probe at Tehran international airport, where part of Iran's air traffic control network is based, said Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. The experts will stay in Iran for a week, the news agency said. The team is in Iran at the request of the Iranian government to help resolve discrepancies in accounts given by the two sides. The U.S. team left the gulf Thursday after spending 3{ weeks in the region, Navy officials said. The team led by Rear Adm. U.S. delegate Edmund Stohr said the United States will offer the U.N. investigating team whatever help it can.
