The USS Vincennes' destruction of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake organization said Sunday. "On the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the captain acted the best way he knew how," said William E. Brooks Jr., publisher of the Vincennes Sun-Commercial newspaper and a member of the USS Vincennes Association. "If the captain had stayed there and not done anything, we might have been reading about loss of life on the Vincennes," Brroks said. The two U.S. missiles were fired by USS Vincennes, an Aegis class cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles. It was the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of Vincennes. Association member Gene Thurmond, 65, of Evansville, served on the second USS Vincennes, a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and sunk by Japanese cruisers in 1942. The association's 500 members meet annually in Vincennes to reminisce about their years of service and pay tribute to the dead, said Vincennes liaison officer and honorary member, Bill Toth, 64. Members of the association were considering a tribute to the 290 people who were killed. "But the captain defended the ship and did what he thought was best for the personnel," he added.
