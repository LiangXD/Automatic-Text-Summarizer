They were cleared of suspicion.; It's a polygraph test, an examination by that simple machine that supposedly detects the lies of those who submit to its cold wires and straps.; Believers in the polygraph include 2,000 polygraph examiners, plus criminologists, attorneys, police departments and the CIA.; They say their tests work because when people lie, their anxiety and fear of being caught involuntarily cause changes in their heartbeats and the way they breathe and sweat. They say it's a mistake to equate fear and distress with guilt.; Wouldn't it be nice if you had a simple test to prove deception? said David Lykken, professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota and a nationally known polygraph expert. But we aren't made like Pinocchio. ; The public usually hears about polygraph tests when somebody famous takes one, often in situations where it's one person's word against another. Twenty-three states allow polygraph results to be admitted as evidence, but usually only if both sides agree in advance. California is one.; Polygraph literally means many writings. Polygraphers can be sly and manipulative in the interest of producing an accurate test. They rely on complex assumptions about human nature and criminal psychology, and their subjects are often unaware how extensively they are being analyzed.; The polygraph test itself is short -- usually no more than 10 questions. You can get an inconclusive test result. ; Pathological liars; Studies also have been done by polygraphers to prove that pathological liars and psychopaths have no advantage because both types know they're lying and neither wants to get caught, said David Raskin, a polygraph examiner and University of Utah psychologist.; Polygraph examiners claim accuracy rates as high as 95 percent. Guilty people who pass the test leave undetected.; Those accuracy claims are challenged by polygraph opponents, who point to studies done by polygraphers themselves that say an innocent person has as much as a 50-50 chance of failing. Other studies show more accurate results for guilty people, saying they are correctly identified 79 percent of the time or better.; One of the most famous accuracy studies cited by polygraph advocates was conducted in 1969 by psychologist Philip Bersh for the U.S. Department of Defense.; 90 percent agreement; A panel of lawyers reviewed evidence (other than the polygraph test) against 400 criminal suspects, then concluded whether the suspects were innocent or guilty.
