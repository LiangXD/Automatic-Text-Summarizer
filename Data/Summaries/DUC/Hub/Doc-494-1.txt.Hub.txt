And, as the general's career unfolds, Democrats should not assume his loyalties lie irrevocably with the GOP.; To begin with, no one knows Powell's political affiliation. But I cannot honestly tell you what are his political positions. I can tell you, however, that proves how great his political skills are. ; As reticent as he is, though, Powell has publicly expressed views on enough foreign and domestic subjects to give some clues of his leanings. But Powell's views do not represent a new mold for the party. Rather, if he choose a political career as a Democrat, Powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's Henry Scoop Jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions on defending U.S. interests abroad.; The bottom line is that Powell presents intriguing opportunities for both parties. Nominating Powell to a future national ticket offers Republicans the chance to cement their presidential majority by breaking the Democratic hold on black votes.; For Democrats, conversely, a national slot for Powell could allow the party to simultaneously affirm its commitment to equal opportunity and dispatch persistent doubts about whether it is tough enough to protect American interests in an unstable world.; If Powell hints even the slightest interest, and Democrats are uncharacteristically alert, it could set off the kind of bipartisan bidding war not seen since 1948, when activists in both parties tried to draft Eisenhower as their presidential candidate.
