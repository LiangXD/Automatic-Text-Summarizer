GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insurance claims arising from Hurricane Andrew could 'cost it as much as Dollars 40m.' However, if this happens, it would suffer a post-tax loss of Dollars 40m (Pounds 20m). Their guess is that losses to be faced by all insurers may total more than Dollars 8bn. However, other insurers have estimated that losses could be as low as Dollars 1bn in total.
