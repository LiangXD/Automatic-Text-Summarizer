Safety standards may not be stringent enough in the cruise industry, the chairman of a federal agency investigating the March engine-room fire aboard the Scandinavian Star said Wednesday. "The cruise ship industry is generally not operated under the U.S. flag. "There may not be sufficient safety standards," he said, adding that his agency has probed fires aboard four cruise ships in the past five years. The March 15 engine-room fire aboard the Star, carrying 439 mostly American passengers, was discovered by a crew member as the ship returned from Cozumel, Mexico to its Tampa home port. Because the NTSB lacks regulatory authority and because cruise ships are often registered outside the United States, he said his agency can only make recommendations. Its engine room was badly damaged by the fire, and there was smoke and water damage throughout the 17-year-old French-made ship, which has since been repaired. The leak continued for 13 minutes after the fire was discovered, feeding the flames, the report said. Peter Schaab said he had to send an officer to the engine room to confirm there was a fire. But the fire was contained to the engine room.
