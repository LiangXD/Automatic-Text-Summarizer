Among the men, Paul Davies-Hale of England proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever. It was the slowest winning time in this race since 1982. A pack of five men took off fast, maintaining a 2:09 pace at nine miles. Davies-Hale had been among those who had cagily stayed back, going with a more conservative approach. I was concentrating on running five-minute miles, he said. His time works out to 5:00.8 mile splits. Davies-Hale caught the second pack at 13 miles and met up with pre-race favorite Steve Binns, who lives 30 miles from Davies-Hale in England's West Midlands. The two quickly went in different directions -- Binns falling back (he eventually dropped out) and Davies-Hale moving up. I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went, Davies-Hale said. At 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun. In the women's race, Weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with that handicapping. She took off in Sunday's race with authority and ran with a 20-30-second cushion for 15 miles. It was the same spot, the corner of Wells and North Avenue, that Weidenbach had taken the lead in last year's race. Davies-Hale may have shown a liking for running in heat when he won the Boulder Bolder that year in terrific heat. Still, Davies-Hale is unsure what his future in the marathon is. I've already had a great track season, Davies-Hale said. Marathon Notes Race organizers insist that this race is at a world-class level, especially pointing to the world's richest purse. Scot Hellebuyck won the men's wheelchair race in 1:45:30. Ann Cody Morris won the women's wheelchair race in 1:58:51.
