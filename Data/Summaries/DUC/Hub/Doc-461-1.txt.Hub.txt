Recently, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten published an article entitled Go Against the North Wind. Just as he said in his article, the reason is that what he has done since he became governor of Hong Kong has been criticized and condemned not only by China and people of Hong Kong, but also by people in Britain. He said: Some criticisms have appeared in both Britain and Hong Kong. The most important point of the article is that Chris Patten was trying hard to explain that all he had done was in the interests of the Hong Kong people. He wrote: Our responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong should be put first. This British Hong Kong governor is really more concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people. For this reason, he feels it unfair that the Hong Kong people are criticizing and condemning him instead of saying thank you to him. What is more, judging from a long-term point of view, our position in China and Asia may, to a great extent, be decided by how we discharge our responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner. To the Chinese people, the following is understandable: Hong Kong was plundered after the Opium War, a war of aggression launched by Britain against China. People will also ask: Why will the position of Britain in China and Asia be decided by how Britain discharges its responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner? If Britain ensures a smooth return of Hong Kong to China in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, is it not a practice in a dignified manner? Does Britain really want to return Hong Kong to China only in name while preserving its position as the governor to show the power and prestige of the British Empire and go on playing the tyrant in China and Asia as a colonialist? Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, has been trying hard to preserve an actual colonial position in Hong Kong and revitalize the colonialist power and prestige of the old British Empire.
