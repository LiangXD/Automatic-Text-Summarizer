Workmen tunneling under the English Channel have created the first land link between Britain and the Continent, connecting 31 miles of tunnel in a prodigious feat of engineering and finance. Linking England and France, the tunnel symbolizes the growing unification of Europe. It also fulfills a dream of Napoleon, who wanted to send his armies through the tunnel to conquer Britain. Tunnelers are expected to walk through and greet each other with handshakes in a few weeks. The tunneling machine on the French side will then guide itself by laser toward the British machine, ensuring perfect alignment. 26. The linkup came on the maintenance tunnel, the smallest of three tunnels being dug. Since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been seven accidental deaths on the British side and two on the French side. Mechanical legs slap together the concrete tunnel lining in the wake of the advancing drill head. Whhen its work is done, the drilling machine on the French side will be hauled out in pieces. The one on the British side will dig a side passage, and be buried in cement. The tunnels were joined 13{ miles southeast of Folkestone, England, the British terminus near Dover, and 10 miles northwest of Sangatte, near Calais. The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting for its total length of 31 miles. More than 200 banks are involved in financing the world's costliest tunnel. Officials estimate the tunnel trains may carry 28 million passengers in the first year of operation. Britain warned Napoleon not to try to build the tunnel; digging was started subsequently in 1882 and 1974, but both efforts failed.
