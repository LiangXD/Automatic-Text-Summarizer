President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a Cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as "the slar eclipse of the century" on July 11. Posters have been placed in Mexico City subways promoting the event, and resorts along the eclipse's path are scrambling to accommodate the expected rush of tourists. The eclipse path reaches from Hawaii through Mexico to Brazil. The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes, the maximum length for a total solar eclipse. But the special government commission, Eclipse 1991, is banking on the clouds to roll in the country's financial favor. It will be the last chance to see a total solar eclipse this century. Most hotels along the eclipse route are full for July 11. Cuernavaca, 35 miles south of Mexico City, is hosting a geophysicists' congress during the week of the eclipse. An eclipse is an astronomical coincidence. Since September, the university newspaper has been publishing installments of a book called "Eclipse" that will be translated into Indian languages. The government plans to supervise the production of special lenses for viewing an eclipse.
