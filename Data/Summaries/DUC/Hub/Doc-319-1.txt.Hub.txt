Michael Milken may be gone from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., but his deal-making days aren't done. Milken's new company, International Capital Access Group, is open for business. Despite the racketeering and securities fraud indictment hanging over him and his forced resignation from Drexel in June, Milken hasn't retreated to the sidelines. When Drexel's former junk bond chief announced plans for the firm, he said it would help members of minority groups and unions raise the capital to own companies. But the new firm is also gearing up for a considerable amount of potentially more profitable business. Since leaving Drexel, Milken has had talks with many of his old firm's clients, according to a senior Drexel executive. And in a long interview in ICAG's offices, Milken confirmed that a significant part of ICAG's business will be with ordinary companies. It may make direct investments in companies. And it is working on finding new capital for successful companies and refinancing firms that are in trouble. In exchange for Milken's brainpower and contacts in arranging refinancing, ICAG expects to receive an ownership stake in most of the companies that it helps. What we're doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at Drexel), in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital, Milken says, although he no longer trades or underwrites securities. He refuses to discuss ICAG's fees or even confirm that he expects the company to be profitable. At Drexel, Milken essentially created the market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, and he revolutionized the way that capital was raised for medium-sized U.S. companies. In the short time since ICAG was formed, it already has purchased $2.5 million worth of barges and other equipment to lease to Unimar International Inc., a Seattle-based shipbuilder and tugboat company that was bought out by its unionized employees with Drexel's help in 1987. Milken says ICAG plans to do this for other employee-owned companies as well, since many of them have trouble raising the money to buy equipment outright. Milken says that, in all, he has been approached by several hundred companies. Milken won't comment on the terms on which ICAG is helping these companies, but one deal that fell through suggests that, while his aim may be to help others, he isn't neglecting his own interests. Puck said he balked when Milken demanded a majority stake in the company. ICAG cannot trade or underwrite securities. Such activities were a main part of Milken's activities at Drexel. In an off-the-record interview, the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively said that he couldn't afford to have any formal business relationship with ICAG. He said the commercial banks with which his company does business have indicated that they might stop lending to him if he does. This hasn't stopped a flood of companies that have approached him in confidence, however. And there are still plenty of well-known executives who praise Milken publicly and wish his company success. Only the firm's name, not Milken's, is on the door. The firm currently has about 20 employees, with more expected to join soon. (Milken says he doesn't know how many.) Officials at the new firm say they are aren't making overtures to lure Drexel employees to ICAG. It's a private firm, he says. By helping companies, Milken means suggesting ways that they could improve their basic business, working out creative means of raising capital or recapitalizing to reduce interest costs, and using his vast network of contacts to put companies in touch with potential investors. After a speech he made in September, Milken was widely quoted as suggesting that companies should now attempt to reduce their level of high-yield debt. Some analysts interpreted this as a major reversal, since Milken's later years at Drexel were largely spent promoting leveraged buyouts financed with huge chunks of junk-bond debt. But Milken maintains that he is simply doing what he has always done, advising companies to profit from market conditions. Milken says his firm expects to help salvage some of the large companies that have been in the news in the last couple of months because of severe difficulties in meeting the payments on their junk debt. When Drexel settled a massive SEC lawsuit, the firm agreed not to do business directly or indirectly with Milken. It's not clear, for example, whether legal problems would arise if a company hired Drexel to underwrite securities according to a recapitalization plan drawn up by Milken. Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, says the firm hasn't lost any clients to ICAG. Milken, who was one of the most feared competitors on Wall Street when he was at Drexel, now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and underwriting business that he can no longer do himself.
