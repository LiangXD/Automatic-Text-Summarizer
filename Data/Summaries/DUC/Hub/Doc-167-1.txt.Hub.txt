Exxon crews Tuesday finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker Exxon Valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of the nation's worst-ever oil spill. The fugitive captain of the Exxon Valdez sent signals he was ready to surrender to face criminal charges of operating the vessel while drunk. We would have lost the vessel," said Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi. A boom wasn't placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it wasn't available in Valdez, Exxon officials have said. Iarossi also said Exxon has changed its policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited, four hours before sailing. Authorities charged the captain had been drinking before the Valdez sailed. Neil Goldschmidt said Tuesday there are "a lot of questions that need to be answered" before the Valdez is allowed in. Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances there will be no damage to the British Columbia coast if the tanker is towed to Oregon, and the mayor of Valdez said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude. The family of the fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, said the skipper wants to surrender but is awaiting advice from his attorney, according to Lt. Bail was previously set in Valdez at $50,000. An effort at Sawmill Bay, 11 miles west of Valdez, to keep oil away from a hatchery where 2 million salmon are waiting to be released to the sea appeared to be failing. Tendrils of oil had floated past a boom streched across the bay, said officials. "The Exxon Valdez accident has taught us that simply having a plan is not sufficient," the Alaska Republican said.
