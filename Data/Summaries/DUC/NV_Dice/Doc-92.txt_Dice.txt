"Every census since the Constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens," observed Rep."Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted" in the census, responded Ridge.The problem has been in deciding which states may count these people as residents.That has yet to be decided, but possibilities include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last state where he or she lived for at least six months.Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, West and industrial states like New York, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted.
