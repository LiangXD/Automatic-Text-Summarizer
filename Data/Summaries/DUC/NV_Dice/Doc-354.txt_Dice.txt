For Israel, there also would be unhappiness if Saddam Hussein's military machine isn't further dismantled in war.The survival of a still-potent Saddam Hussein would be a problem not only for President Bush but for many of America's chief allies, particularly Israel.But Mr. Bush also now seems caught in the gap between the formal war aims he and the United Nations have proclaimed -- which focus narrowly on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of Kuwait's rulers -- and the allies' unofficial desire to do away with Saddam Hussein's regime along the way.The announcement of the peace plan in Moscow occurred only hours after Saddam Hussein had delivered a defiant speech in Baghdad in which he seemed to dare the U.S. and its allies to launch a ground attack to drive his troops out of Kuwait.But for precisely that same reason, some U.S. officials have grown increasingly eager to press on with the war to finish off Iraq's military machine while the chance is available.The broader dilemma is that the proposal forces Mr. Bush to make a choice he had hoped to avoid: between the prospect of achieving the minimum goal of freeing Kuwait without further bloodshed, and the chance to crush President Hussein and his military might at the risk of a bloody ground war.For the U.S., one of the public complaints is likely to involve the failure of the plan to comply with all 12 U.N. resolutions passed to compel Iraq to leave Kuwait.By bloodying the Guards now, the U.S. may hope to make it more difficult for Saddam Hussein to survive and cause trouble down the road, even if he is left standing when the war ends.But the plan was vague on many details, such as just what the timetable for withdrawal would be.Saudi leaders, in particular, don't want the war to stop until Saddam Hussein is out of power because they must share a long, thinly guarded border with an Iraq that even now could remain militarily more powerful than the thinly populated Saudi kingdom.Those aspects of the plan might allow Saddam Hussein time to withdraw all his military gear, and to quickly rebuild his economy so that he can purchase new weapons.He'll also want a timetable for withdrawal that would force Saddam Hussein to leave much of his weaponry behind, as well as assurances that the U.N. can continue pressing Iraq to pay war reparations.U.S. officials have speculated all along that Saddam Hussein might choose survival over continued occupation of Kuwait when he thought his options were that stark.Above all, the U.S. will be unhappy that the plan would remove economic sanctions after only two-thirds of Iraqi forces are withdrawn.He, too, would be more comfortable if Saddam Hussein were finished.By presenting Mr. Bush with that choice, Saddam Hussein may not only be posing an agonizing decision but finally taking a step toward splitting the extraordinary international coalition that Mr. Bush built -- many of whose members will want to accept the Iraqi withdrawal and declare victory.
