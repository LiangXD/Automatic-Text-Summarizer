The agency is studying its "legal options" and may ask the Coast Guard to take over the cleanup from Exxon, she said.An unqualified mate was piloting the Exxon Valdez -- violating both Coast Guard regulations and company policy -- when the tanker crashed into rocks, unleashing the worst oil spill in U.S. history, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday."The Coast Guard doesn't have tons and tons of its own equipment, and it would have to hire the same people Exxon has," Nelson said.Cousins, a three-year employee of Exxon, did not have the Coast Guard certification required to pilot through the sound but was qualified under other circumstances to steer the ship, Iarossi said.Hasn't Seen Plan "We have been told by Exxon that they will come up with an organized cleanup plan, but we've yet to see one," said Barbara Holian, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Conservation.She said it might be too perilous to try to capture panicky birds and otters from boats in the frigid water, and there is no road access to the shores where they are likely to show up.No disciplinary action has been taken against any crew members, Iarossi said.At Coast Guard offices here, Nelson said such a move was unlikely.At no time did the ship lose steering, he added."The reason we haven't seen a large number of birds affected so far is that the oil is out in the middle of the sound," said Everett Robinson-Wilson, the agency's environmental contaminant coordinator.Rocks Charted He indicated that the rocks the ship hit were charted and well within range of the Exxon Valdez's navigational equipment.Nelson said piloting a ship without proper certification is a civil, not criminal, violation, which ultimately could result in suspension or revocation of the captain's license.The ship then "slid about two miles" under full power and hit more underwater rocks, Iarossi said."The Coast Guard may seem slow and plodding at times, but if we file charges, we're going to make them stick," he added.Wildlife experts were summoned from California to coordinate any efforts to rescue birds and sea otters, whose feathers and fur make them the most vulnerable to oil contamination.Another 1 million barrels remain aboard the damaged ship, but no new leakage has been reported.So far, oil has washed ashore only on two tiny islands in the sound, and beach cleanup efforts were under way.Exxon has not made any of the Exxon Valdez's 20 crew members available for interviews.
