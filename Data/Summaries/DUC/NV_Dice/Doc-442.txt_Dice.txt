Mr Kraai van Niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on continued political reform in South Africa, and Prieska is the centre of his constituency.Indeed, I had expected that the arid area in which the minister's own farm is situated would be suffering most.Mr van Niekerk concedes that such suggestions contain an element of truth But the drought is also an established fact and there are socio-economic as well as agricultural reasons why as many farmers as possible should be saved.But in the meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow.Today Prieska relies almost entirely on agriculture and in both prosperity and population it is only half the town it once was.As the minister said, that is a long way ahead and there will be time to make arrangements to deal with that problem should it occur.Some of his optimism was based, however, on the possibility that South African-grown wheat could be substituted for maize when it was harvested in November.To allow vast numbers of farms to go out of business at a time when there is little enthusiasm, even among successful farmers for expansion, would put tens of thousands of black farm labourers out of work.
