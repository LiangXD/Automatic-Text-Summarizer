"Higher wages . . . for some will mean jobs lost for those workers who are trying hardest to break into the labor market," warns GOP Sen."That is exactly what raising the minimum wage will do."The advocates of a higher minimum wage say increases are necessary to offset lost ground.Opponents of raising the minimum wage insist that past increases have had a substantial effect in both layoffs and "disemployment" -- workers not hired who otherwise would have been.Opponents of boosting the wage floor argue that it is these jobs that are most at risk.In return for administration agreement to raising the wage, Mr. Brock says, Congress must also allow a "youth differential" wage that's lower than the minimum wage, so as not to discourage employers from hiring untrained new job entrants.Among adults, the commission found that if increases in the wage floor lowered employment at all -- which it said isn't clear -- the amount may be so small as to be undetectable with any precision.Between 1978 and 1981, Congress raised the minimum wage four times.No longer does the minimum wage keep all those who earn it above the poverty level: A full-time minimum-wage worker earns less than $7,000 a year, only 80% of what the government considers sufficient to keep a family of three out of poverty, and only 60% of what's needed for a family of four.In 1968, the minimum wage was about 53% of the average hourly wage of a manufacturing employee.Now the minimum amounts to only 34% of the average manufacturing wage.He says the increase would affect the unemployment rate by less than one-tenth of a percentage point, and adds: "Estimates of dire consequences to the economy as a result of raising the minimum wage do not stand up to scrutiny."Ronald Sarasin, a lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association, acknowledges that "we're going to survive" even if the the wage is increased, but warns of the consequences for low-paid workers: "This is less a business issue than a jobs issue."
