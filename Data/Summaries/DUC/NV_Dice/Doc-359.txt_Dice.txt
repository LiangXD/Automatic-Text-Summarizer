About half the old workers were foreigners, especially Palestinians, who either fled the country during the war or have been ordered by the Kuwaiti government to stay off work because of alleged Iraqi sympathies.But until it can export its oil, it will have little cash to obtain reasonably priced supplies of basic necessities.; Many of the goods coming into the country are being bought by private businessmen with hard currency they stockpiled before the war.That toll includes: 100,000 to 120,000 Iraqi troops; 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians; 20,000 Kurdish and Shiite insurgents; and 15,000 to 30,000 refugees.; And a team from Harvard University recently visited Iraq and forecast that more than 170,000 children will die in the coming months from disease and war-related traumas.; BURNING WELLS; 500 FIRES STILL RAGE ON KUWAITI OIL FIELDS; Crews capped the 100th well last weekend in the smoke-darkened gloom of Kuwait's blazing oil fields, about 20 wells ahead of schedule.; Oil experts and firefighters are now predicting that at least half the 500 oil fires still blazing could be out by the end of summer.; The four companies fighting the fires estimate that it will take 13 more months to put out all the fires -- a much shorter amount of time than had been feared when the world first glimpsed the awesome spectacle of Kuwait's 600 burning oil wells.; The current pace of two wells per day is expected to slow in the coming weeks, however, as crews turn their attention to the most badly damaged wells.That costs a minimum of $600,000 to $700,000 each.; Crews have not yet been able to enter the heart of the Burgan oil field, the most densely drilled reservoir in the world, where as many as 300 fires are blazing unchecked.Iranian officials were not partners in an international relief effort to help the Kurds, and information from that region has been difficult to verify.; And there are indications that thousands of southern Iraqis may never go home.
