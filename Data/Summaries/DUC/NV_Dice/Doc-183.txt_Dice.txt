Officials at the National Hurricane Service in Miami said the storm was expected to reach land some time this afternoon or evening.Bob Ebaugh, a weather specialist at the hurricane center, said 10 to 15 inches of rain was expected in southern Mississippi, Louisiana and East Texas.The best estimate Monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the western Louisiana or upper Texas coast.One particular concern in Houston was the possibility of major flooding should the city be on the wet, or eastern, side of the hurricane.Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the Texas and Louisiana coasts Monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside.Shortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center in Miami announced that Chantal was blowing at more than 74 m.p.h., strong enough to move it into the lowest hurricane classification, and the winds were later reported at 75 m.p.h.
