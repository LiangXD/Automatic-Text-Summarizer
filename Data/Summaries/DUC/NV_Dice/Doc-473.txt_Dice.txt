A more candid union argument holds that increases in the minimum raises wage scales generally, but the truth of that is doubtful too.That's more than a 44% increase.Some of those new jobs wouldn't be there if Congress had continued to dictate a minimum level of wages.Since Congress stopped raising the federal minimum wage in 1981, the U.S. economy has generated nine million new jobs at all salary levels.At any rate, a study commission appointed by Jimmy Carter estimated in a 1981 report that every 10% increase in the minimum wage cost the economy 80,000 to 200,000 entry-level jobs.Worst news of all, Labor Secretary William Brock appears ready to compromise away President Reagan's soundly based opposition to the minimum wage.
