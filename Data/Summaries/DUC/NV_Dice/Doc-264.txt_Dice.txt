Huaycan is one of the slums where Shining Path works hardest because it is just off the Central Highway, a strategic route through the capital's main industrial zone to the mountains.Abimael Guzman, founder of the rebel movement, has said of the slums and their people: "The immense masses of the shantytowns are like belts of steel that lock in the enemy and hold back his reactionary forces."I have been in a shantytown where there is a Shining Path group, and the police are doing nothing about it."Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains eight years ago, are moving into the shantytowns that encircle the capital like a noose.His Maoist rebels, once secretive fanatics, are becoming a political force that seeks public support in Huaycan and the other makeshift communities where two-thirds of Lima's 7 million people scrape along.Shining Path has infiltrated 167 unions and neighborhood associations in the Lima slums this year, says a confidential Interior Ministry report obtained by The Associated Press.Guerrillas threaten and sometimes kill community leaders, establish "people's schools" and set up "street theaters" for propaganda, it said.Guzman's guerrillas have followed tens of thousands of peasants from the Andes into Lima's shantytowns and see the slums as a new stronghold.Cardinal Juan Landazuri of the Roman Catholic Church said: "Priests tell me that young people in the shantytowns are going over to Sendero.
