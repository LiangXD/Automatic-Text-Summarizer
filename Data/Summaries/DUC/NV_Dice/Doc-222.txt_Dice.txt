"Selling diamonds is the business of dealers and jewelers; helping them to sell more is ours," says Stephen Lussier, a De Beers marketing executive."De Beers is powerful; it is everywhere," says Alfred Lachowsky, chairman of the Antwerp Diamond High Council.While average prices of De Beers's rough diamonds rose 37%, prices of polished diamonds in dealers' stocks collapsed.But De Beers is unique, he says, in influencing production and consumption of diamonds.De Beers managed the comeback by convincing diamond producers, dealers and the jewelry industry that its marketing muscle was indispensable."People mesmerized by the producers' cartels forget that De Beers is an aggressive, ruthless and effective sales organization," says a London dealer.1 market, with $8 billion in annual retail diamond jewelry sales, or about a 40% share, even though a 1971 antitrust law prevents De Beers from operating directly there.Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving.In a series of shrewd moves, De Beers forced Zaire to rejoin the cartel by dumping diamonds.The cartel will continue to control world diamond markets, Mr. Lachosky says.The master sales plan began in 1938, when former De Beers Chairman Harry Oppenheimer asked Ayer to woo American couples to buy expensive diamond engagement rings.World diamond production has soared to 88 million carats from 47 million carats in 1982."De Beers can't stop evolution," says Jack Lunzer, chairman of IDC Holdings Ltd., a London-based diamond firm that sells diamonds for Guinea, an African nation that isn't a cartel member.De Beers has a sales arrangement with the Soviets, but Moscow has dumped diamonds before and may prove difficult to keep in line.Supplemented by $20 million spent by the diamond trade, the De Beers campaign helped raise world sales of diamond jewelry to 47 million pieces valued at $21.6 billion in 1985, up from 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion in 1979.About three-fourths of American women own diamond engagement rings that cost an average $1,300.
