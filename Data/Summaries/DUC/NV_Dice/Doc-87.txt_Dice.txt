This year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United States is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases.It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis.The overall incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is 9.5 cases per 100,000 population, he said.There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the U.N. agency.But when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as it can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect numerous others.In New York City, which has the highest number of AIDS cases in the nation, the incidence is 36 per 100,000, Bloom said.Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday.The U.N. agency, in its first comprehensive look at global tuberculosis in a decade, said the disease kills nearly 3 million people a year, most of them between the ages of 15 and 59, "the segment of the population that is economically most productive."
