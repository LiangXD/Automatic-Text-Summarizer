Most patients with promyleocytic leukemia apparently have the same defect in two of their 23 chromosomes, the structures in the cell that contain all the genes.It is an uncommon cancer, afflicting about 1,000 Americans a year, in which certain cells in the bone marrow become malignant before they have matured into fully functioning white blood cells.But, he added, the U.S. group is the first to show that the drug works by triggering the immature cancer cells to mature, or to "differentiate," in the biologists jargon.In the type of leukemia suffered by the patients, white blood cells have turned malignant at an immature stage of cell development.
