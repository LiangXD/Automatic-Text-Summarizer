A coalition of center-right parties formed a new government last month in Slovenia, the most prosperous of Yugoslavia's six republics, after trouncing reform Communists in the first free state elections held in Communist-ruled Yugoslavia in 45 years.The media said a joint session of the republic's 240-seat legislature voted unanimously to adopt the Declaration of Sovereignty of the State of Slovenia.The hard-line Communist government in the largest state of Serbia vehemently opposes turning Yugoslavia into a confederation.The republic's new authorities demand that Yugoslavia transform itself into a loose confederation of sovereign states.
