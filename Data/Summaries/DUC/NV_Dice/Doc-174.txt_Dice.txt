There are hundreds of beaches all over the sound that are still oiled, and the oil is slowly bleeding out."Oil," he says.They say observers flying over the sound still report 15 to 20 oil sheens bleeding off beaches daily.Those numbers alone make the Valdez spill the most lethal ever, but scientists say the actual death count is much higher, estimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank from sight or drifted out to sea.From a helicopter, the wave-washed beach looks as if the worst oil spill in U.S. history had never touched it.That leaves 50 percent to 75 percent of the oil in the water, on the ocean bottom or on beaches.But when Exxon suspended its $2 billion cleanup in mid-September, it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the oil spilled, state officials estimate.The state sued, claiming the company was negligent in responding to the spill, only to be countersued by Exxon, which claimed state officials hindered the use of chemical dispersants that could have broken up large quantities of oil early on."Hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under this beach," he says.
