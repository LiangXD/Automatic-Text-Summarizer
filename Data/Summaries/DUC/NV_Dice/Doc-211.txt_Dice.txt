The department is clearing some areas by setting small fires that are tightly controlled, the first of which recently burned off 335 hillside acres in the Monte Nido area of Malibu.Given the severity of the threat and lack of equipment and water to fight fires, officials throughout the region say they plan an unusually aggressive approach this spring, trying to put out even the smallest wildfires before they spread, and taking preventive measures such as deploying firefighters to an area where lightning storms are forecast.While reluctant to predict fires because they depend not just on drought but also on temperature and wind patterns, fire officials are deeply worried.
