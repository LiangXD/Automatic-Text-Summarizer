"I think this book has the chance to have more impact.The man who would have been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court and was stingingly rebuffed by the Senate is quick to smile at the irony the last two years have brought.He was halfway down the slope, he says, "when the muscles began to flutter and that's not very good because you have to get down the rest of the mountain."The law reviews have yet to come out, but one university is planning four of them."Popular culture as far as I'm concerned has gone straight downhill," Bork says.He says he is taking his case to a higher court, the American public and the next generation.Has that vindicated his views?And you can't sit down and write 300 pages of connected argument to show why this is the right approach."Not mine," says Bork.Bork has plans for perhaps two more books, one in more academic detail on constitutional law aimed at law schools, and another on the relationship of law and the culture.
