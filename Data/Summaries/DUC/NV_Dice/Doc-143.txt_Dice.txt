Bank of Boston also placed on non-accrual $470 million in loans to less-developed countries that are unrelated to trade.Along with $330 million in such loans previously put on non-accrual, Bank of Boston has now either charged off, or put on non-accrual, all of its $1 billion loans to heavily indebted developing countries.Continental wouldn't comment yesterday on Bank of Boston's action.When a loan is placed on non-accrual, a bank only credits interest it actually receives, and doesn't automatically accrue interest due.Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on whether it might follow Bank of Boston's action.On one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries.On the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as Bank of Boston decided Monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible.Bank of Boston Corp.'s decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions, bankers and analysts say.The reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like Bank of Boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities, bank analysts said.Analysts expect that other regional banks may copy the action taken by Bank of Boston.For instance, if Manufacturers Hanover Corp. imitated Bank of Boston's action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, Keefe Bruyette estimates.
