For the first five years after a fire, while surrounding vegetation is still relatively low, there will be a proliferation of wildflowers in the park, she says.As Yellowstone National Park's research biologist, he has already begun to monitor the forest's rebirth from the worst fire on record.Mr. Despain has set up or is planning several long-term research projects to study the effects of this year's fires.The fire was so intense that a gray shadow on the forest floor is all that remains of a fallen log."Fires have been an integral force in the Yellowstone ecosystem for the past 10,000 years since the glaciers left," Mr. Varley says.Shrubs and grasses cover what is left of the burnt undergrowth, although fire scars will be visible on some trees for years.Tourists will be back next year for this . . . and perhaps to see how nature is restoring the forest.Then the forest thins as it ages, trees fall, underbrush grows, and the forest is primed for a fire to start its life cycle over again.Aspen trees, whose paper-white bark and yellow leaves punctuate the evergreen forests this time of year, also thrive after a fire.Mr. Despain says it is no coincidence that most burnt trees here were senior citizens, relatively speaking, and highly susceptible to fire.Hundreds of plant species proliferate after a fire until "canopy closure" is achieved in about 40 years.These and the rest of the park's thermal features remain unscathed by the fires.The mature forest "has the least biological diversity of any habitat in the park," Mr. Varley says.Carol Shively, a park ranger-naturalist at Grant Village in Yellowstone, says, "Next spring is going to be a spectacular one for wildflowers."Seeds that have been dormant for decades beneath the soil appear to be triggered by the passing fire, he says, and will germinate next spring.Yellowstone's meadows rebound the fastest after a fire.There has yet to be a confirmed report of a large animal killed by the flames, although a few deaths are almost inevitable, park officials say.In an average year, 2.5 million tourists visit the huge park, and a drop-off because of the fire damage could severely hurt business.The last fire to rival this year's in intensity roared across much of Yellowstone in the early 1700s.The tiny seeds are slowly released from rock-hard pine cones only after the cones have been seared by the passing flames; indeed, they require a fire to propagate themselves."Ecologically, there's no down side to the fire," he adds, conceding that similar statements by park officials may have sounded cavalier when the fires were raging.Three to five additional bird species are likely to migrate into Yellowstone next year, attracted to the new plants and insects thriving in the meadows.The profusion of pine seeds is just one of the rejuvenating forces at work in Yellowstone even as the fires, largely quenched this week by rain and snow, still smolder.Forests visited only by ground fires will rebound almost as quickly.A panel of academics and scientists is being assembled to study this year's fires and make recommendations on what changes might be in order.The burnt "snags," as charred tree trunks are called, creak in the wind above Mr. Despain and are all that remain of a forest section that sprouted after a fire swept through here about the time of the Civil War.Wyoming's U.S. senators, Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Alan K. Simpson, are mindful of the damage the fires caused the state's tourist industry this year, as well as the threat to gateway towns near the park.Yellowstone's elk and bison herds, as well as moose, should benefit from the additional forage in the park next year.Driving along the 140 miles of the park's upper and lower scenic loop -- on roads open to park visitors -- one sees a Yellowstone that is a patchwork of green, brown and blackened forest and meadow.The National Park Service has already been at the center of a much-publicized political firestorm over its 16-year-old "natural burn" policy, which allows lightning-caused fires to burn themselves out, except where they threaten towns or park buildings.
