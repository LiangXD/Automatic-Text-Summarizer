Another administration official, however, said Mr. Sununu's departure may force Mr. Bush to get more involved in economic issues.Moreover, while Mr. Bush is under attack for lack of attention to domestic policy, Mr. Skinner can claim credit for shepherding major highway and mass transit legislation through Congress.Mr. Sununu, said the official, "is really more of a pragmatist."By the time he and the president agreed on his departure, Mr. Sununu, who made self-confidence a badge of honor, was despondent.Mr. Sununu previously was offered the opportunity to switch jobs with Mr. Skinner, administration officials say, but turned it down.In his letter, Mr. Sununu hailed the "chemistry, friendship, caring and irreverence" he encountered during his tenure in the Oval Office.Moreover, Mr. Sununu's ouster is unlikely to result in any major changes in Mr. Bush's economic policies, which have attracted much criticism recently.One high-ranking official said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is almost certain to get one of those two jobs -- probably the chief of staff position.As a result, Mr. Sununu became a favorite of many social conservatives who distrusted Mr. Bush's roots in the moderate wing of his party.In his reply, Mr. Bush said he accepted Mr. Sununu's resignation "with reluctance, regret and a sense of personal loss."The president had already been searching for a way to ease Mr. Sununu out of his post gracefully.Mr. Sununu had sometimes denied access to officials who wished to talk to the president about economic and domestic issues.Late last month, in a television interview, Mr. Sununu suggested that President Bush had erred by ad-libbing into a speech his view that banks should lower credit-card interest rates.The announcement of Mr. Sununu's departure came in Meridian, Miss., where the White House distributed photocopies of the handwritten resignation letter.Judd Gregg, both of whom regard Mr. Sununu with suspicion.
