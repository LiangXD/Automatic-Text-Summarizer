The earthquake unhinged a wall of sodden dirt and mud at least five miles wide that buried the village of Okuli-Bolo and much of Sharora, said Erkin Kasimov, an official of Tadzhikistan's Foreign Ministry."When the earthquake came, it was like a catapult, and it hurled the sodden earth onto the villages below," Kasimov said.More than 70 villagers were buried by the landslide, it said."Our sympathy certainly goes out again to the victims of this most recent earthquake," he said.A predawn earthquake in Soviet Central Asia unleashed a 50-foot-high wall of dirt and mud that buried a mountain village and swept through at least two others Monday, killing up to 1,000 people as they slept, officials said.Officials and Soviet media said the devastation was vast, and total in places.But the official at the Dushanbe seismic center said families are traditionally large in the mostly Moslem republic, and that one dwelling often houses eight to 10 people.It said all of the village's streets had been buried under the 50-foot-high layer of earth that the earthquake detached from a hill near the village.Tass said the number of dead in the disaster zone 1,800 miles southeast of Moscow was estimated at 1,000, but cautioned that was a preliminary figure."Almost everybody died," Zainiddin Nasreddinov, editor-in-chief of Tadzhikistan's official news agency, said by telephone after visiting the wrecked farming settlement of Sharora.
