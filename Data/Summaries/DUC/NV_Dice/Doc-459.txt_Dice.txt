Mr Lu said China would have to make preparations ahead of 1997 for the cancellation of Mr Patten's proposed democratic reforms; but he stopped short of saying China would set up an alternative administration in Hong Kong before the end of British rule.Mr Lu Ping, China's senior official for Hong Kong affairs, said that if Mr Patten pressed ahead with his democratic reforms Beijing would start a 'new kitchen' in 1997 - a Chinese expression which means making a fresh start.The Basic Law is a mini-constitution for Hong Kong after 1997 which was approved by China's parliament in 1990.
