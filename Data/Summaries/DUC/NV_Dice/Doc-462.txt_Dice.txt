In an interview with the media on the last day of his stay in Australia, he went so far as to say that Chinese officials do not understand the international status and importance of Hong Kong so their criticism of him does not conform to reality, adding that Hong Kong is an "international asset" as well as China's asset.Though Britain has ruled over Hong Kong for one and a half centuries, the fact that Hong Kong is China's sacred territory will never change.What merits attention is that this was not the first time Patten has referred to Hong Kong as an "international asset."How can China's sovereignty over Hong Kong be evaded!During his recent trip to Australia, apart from saying that Hong Kong was an "international asset," he claimed that for various countries to support Hong Kong in expanding democracy is not equivalent to interfering in China's internal affairs.If anyone says Mr Patten has loafed around and wandered about doing nothing since he arrived in Hong Kong, this is unfair.It is because the Chinese Government has a profound and accurate understanding of Hong Kong's past and present state, and its international status, that it was able to advance a series of principles and policies including "one country, two systems," "allowing Hong Kong people to administer Hong Kong and enjoy a high degree of autonomy," and so on to solve Hong Kong problems.Patten's allegation that the Chinese side does not understand Hong Kong's "international status" is entirely nonsense.According to Patten, since Hong Kong is an "international asset," it belongs to the international community, namely, it is shared by every country in the world or at least it is an independent or semi-independent political entity, over which China cannot exercise sovereignty.Therefore, Patten's behavior is not personal but reflects a change in Britain's policy toward Hong Kong.Hong Kong is ranked among the biggest international cities and has become one of the international economic, trade, financial, and shipping centers but this will never change the fact that it is part of Chinese territory.
