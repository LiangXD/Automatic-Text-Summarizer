The nationalist governments of Slovenia and Croatia have been demanding a looser confederation of sovereign republics.But Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa said in a television interview that fighting was going on in at least 20 places in Slovenia, and he estimated there were more than 100 dead and wounded on both sides.JEZERSKO, Yugoslavia -- On Wednesday, the Slovene soldiers manning this border post raised a new flag to mark Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia.Less than two days after Slovenia and Croatia, two of Yugoslavia's six republics, unilaterally seceded from the nation, the federal government in Belgrade mobilized troops to regain control.And they fear losing the economic support of Slovenia and Croatia, the two wealthiest republics."The first shots that have been fired in Slovenia since after World War II," he said.He called on Slovenes in the federal army to desert and join the republic's militia.Politically, the two republics' declarations of independence have been ignored by the rest of the world, which supports a united Yugoslavia.Together, Slovenia, with two million people, and Croatia, with five million, supply nearly two-thirds of Yugoslavia's foreign exchange and about half of the country's gross national product.Slovenes watching the action were horrified, as the consequences of their independence grab became clear.The independence declarations came after months of unsuccessful negotiations among the leaders of the six republics over the post-Cold War shape of Yugoslavia."To put it briefly, Slovenia is at war," he said.
