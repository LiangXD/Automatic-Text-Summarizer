"I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago," Daley said."I'm the head of this police department, and if this police department is bad, it's because I'm bad as superintendent," Martin said.But Daley maintains that what's getting worse is "irresponsible political rhetoric" from black politicians who are looking ahead to the 1991 mayoral election.At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.
