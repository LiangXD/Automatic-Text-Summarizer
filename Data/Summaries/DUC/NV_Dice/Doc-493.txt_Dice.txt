Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to become the nation's top military officer.Along with his predecessor as national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, Powell was credited with helping the Reagan White House recover from the Iran-Contra affair.Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City and raised in the South Bronx.As well, Powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political finesse with Congress are as essential as toughened battlefield instincts.He's had experiences few can match," said Robert Sims, a former Pentagon spokesman who knew Powell when he served as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's military aide.Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have outweighed his military experience.Powell currently is commander of the Army Forces Command in Fort MacPherson, Ga., responsible for the combat readiness of 1 million troops on active, reserve or National Guard duty.
