Hurricanes are classified by the Saffir-Simpson scale, the fiercest a No.Gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the '50s and '60s, because of an apparent break in the periodic West African drought.The strongest recorded storm on Earth, Zimmer says, was 1979 Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars."If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will," Emanuel explains."The probability of more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s," says meteorologist William M. Gray of Colorado State University, who analyzes hurricane patterns.The threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded, says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Hurricanes are like huge, self-sustaining heat engines spinning across the sea.Officially a 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it "may be a borderline 5," says meteorologist Mark Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.Outside the Atlantic area and the eastern Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons or cyclones.
