James Worrall, a Canadian member of the IOC, said Johnson "has been killed" as an athlete.Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used a muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field."If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again, my brother is not on drugs," she said.Lewis has previously alleged widespread drug use in track and field."Everybody uses drugs," said sprinter Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone."I feel sorry for Ben and for the Canadian people," he said today.Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today "in a complete state of shock," accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal.
