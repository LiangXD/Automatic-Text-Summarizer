Making junk mainstream is what did Milken in -- and ultimately what did in the junk bond market.When the junk market was small and had few players, people had no one to deal with but Milken, and he could keep weak borrowers out of the market.Because Milken is very smart, has a good head for numbers and could work incredible hours, he found more of these little jewels than anyone else did.But as the market for junk grew larger -- mainly because of what Michael was doing -- Milken wanted to keep all the business.Milken was obsessed with getting more and more people to accept the Gospel of Junk, and he almost single-handedly turned junk from a backwater of finance into a mainstream investment.He used to pride himself on having established the junk bond market.When the market was small, no one knew or cared what Milken was doing.To understand Milken, you have to understand that when he wandered into the world of junk bonds at a third-rate Philadelphia brokerage house in the 1970s, the junk market consisted of a handful of canny investors who spent their days searching through the rubble of financially distressed companies searching for securities that were better than they looked.He was used to operating without anyone knowing what he was doing, and he didn't understand that the rules had changed, and he had to clean up his act.By the time Milken broke down and cried several times Wednesday, it was far too late for him to be considered a human being.Milken's department was making so much money that Drexel Chairman Frederick H. Joseph let Milken do whatever he wanted because Joseph needed the Milken-generated profits to turn Drexel into a mainline brokerage house.To do that, he financed deals that he knew he should never have touched, and he went so far as to offer secret goodies to people who had money to invest in junk.Even though he brought it on himself, watching how this man has destroyed himself is enough to make me want to cry.
