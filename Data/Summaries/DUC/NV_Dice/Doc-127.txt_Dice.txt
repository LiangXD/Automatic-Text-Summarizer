Yet Mr. Goldwin believes the amendment means, as he later says, "that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the militia."The Second Amendment, in its language and its history, makes plain that the need for a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition for the right to keep and bear arms.The right of the people to serve in the militia."In Ohio, we have an Ohio militia that is not a part of the National Guard.The fear of standing armies and the control these armed men gave a central government was foremost in the Framers' minds when writing the Bill of Rights.What I resent is Mr. Goldwin's agenda, which is removal of all guns from American citizens through the implementation of total regulations; a direct violation of the Second Amendment through nefarious means.Samuel R. Bush III Cincinnati --- Let those who want guns join the National Guard, says Mr. Goldwin.
