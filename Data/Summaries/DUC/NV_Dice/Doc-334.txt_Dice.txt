15, in a five-page handwritten letter to Bush as they flew to Florida for a speech at a juice factory Tuesday.; The former New Hampshire governor, ending weeks of speculation and criticism of his performance, told Bush in the letter he "would never want to not be contributing positively, much less be a drag on your success."; In thinly veiled comments, Sununu made it clear that he felt betrayed because, in many ways, he was doing exactly what Bush had hired him to do.; The departing chief of staff was also obliquely reminding the president that this was not a matter of principle, but of ratings; his bullying tactics had been fine as long as the opinion polls did not go down.; "I assure you that in pit-bull mode or pussycat mode (your choice, as always), I am ready to help," Sununu wrote.; His reference was sardonic.Important Republicans scorned by Sununu began going on the record with their advice to Bush that he was being ill served by his chief of staff.; And finally and most important, the president's wife, Barbara, and oldest son, George, turned on Sununu.; And so, finally, Bush invited Sununu to resign.; In accepting Sununu's letter of resignation, Bush said he regretted but supported Sununu's "good decision."
