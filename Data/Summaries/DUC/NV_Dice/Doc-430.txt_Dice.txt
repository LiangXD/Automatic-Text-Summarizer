The governor received $80,000 directly from American Continental and Lincoln Savings; $19,000 from Keating and his family members; $51,000 from other American Continental subsidiaries and executives; and $23,000 from Keating business associates.* Keating and associates gave $176,500 to other state political organizations and politicians.Keating also paid $200,000 in 1985 for the consulting services of former Savings and Loan Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart, who had left government service in December, 1984, for a job with TCS Enterprises of San Diego."One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause," said Keating.As attorneys, he hired fund raiser Samuelian and Franklin Tom, a former state commissioner of savings and loan who left public service to join Samuelian's Los Angeles law firm.In California, Keating hired key Deukmejian supporters or appointees to help protect his ill-fated Lincoln Savings.Meanwhile, Keating and his associates were investing heavily in California state politics.Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr., his family and his business empire poured nearly $350,000 into state politics during 1985 and 1986, with about half of it going to Gov.While Keating himself gave only $7,000 -- all of it to Deukmejian -- the coalition of his relatives, business interests and associates brought total donations to $349,500 in 1985 and 1986.In April, Keating's American Continental Corp. of Phoenix filed for bankruptcy, prompting federal officials to immediately take over its subsidiary Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.The governor has said that he met Keating only once and never knew of Lincoln's financial woes until he read about them in newspaper reports this year.
