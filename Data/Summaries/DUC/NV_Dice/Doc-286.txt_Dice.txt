"The problem with Type II diabetics is not that they don't make enough insulin; they don't respond to the insulin," DeFronzo said.Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes, but it is most prevalent among minorities, especially Native Americans, blacks and Hispanics."We don't know why, when they get diabetes, they have a more severe form of the disease _ whether it's a biological difference or is it that they are not getting as good medical care."My mother has diabetes and they tell me I might have diabetes, too, but I don't know too much about it.The study is in its follow-up stage, to see if diagnosed diabetes patients have changed their lifestyle and have sought medical care.In obese diabetics, the body has too much insulin because it is burning more fats than sugars.All of our family is going to go through the program to make sure that if we have it that we'll do something about it."San Antonio, the nation's ninth largest city, with a population that is 50 percent Hispanic, is becoming the base for diabetes studies.
