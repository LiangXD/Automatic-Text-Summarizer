The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that BSE was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.The Southwood report said it was "most unlikely" that the disease was a threat to humans.David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of "BSE hysteria" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is "remote."There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
