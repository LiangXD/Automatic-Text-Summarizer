"For eight years this same coalition of Republican senators has blocked any increase in the minimum wage," said Sen.And the president, at a White House meeting with reporters, insisted he had made his best and last offer to raise the wage, which has been frozen for eight years.The bill due for House debate today calls for raising the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1992 and has no provision for a sub-minimum training wage, an idea long opposed by the sponsors and organized labor, which has been lobbying heavily against such proposals.The training wage would initially be $3.35 an hour but would increase to 85 percent of the subsequent increases in the minimum wage.The administration guidelines include raising the minimum wage, now at $3.35 an hour, to $4.25 an hour by 1992, provided employers can pay new hires a "training wage" of $3.35 an hour for six months.
