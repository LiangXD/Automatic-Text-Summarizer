The House Democrats' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious.The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients.It is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the Family Welfare Reform Act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency.By adding several welfare programs to what already exists (without eliminating any), the House bill adds another layer to an already complex welfare system.By further increasing rather than gradually reducing the level of benefits available to recipients, it makes welfare more, not less, enticing.The proposed new spending on welfare should be viewed as an investment, say its proponents, led by Rep.The bill's questionable premise is that larger expenditures on welfare will reduce welfare dependency.This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987.It appears that what we have here is something of a Trojan horse -- a piece of legislation that is represented as "reform" when all it does is expand existing welfare programs.
