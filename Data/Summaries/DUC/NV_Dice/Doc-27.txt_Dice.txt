Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong.It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year.The officer who shot Barnes was a two-year veteran of the force.Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens.Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said."This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr. Barnes' family and for this officer," Bishop said.Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar and whether he would have lunged at the officer.
