Should the court rule against term limits by the states, numerous other ballot access restrictions will likely be passed that have many of the same effects as term limits.But the court's decision affected only term limits on state officials; federal officeholders weren't included in California's limits.States could allow an incumbent who has served a set number of years in the same office to run again, but only as a "write-in" candidate.Federal courts have upheld many state restrictions on who may qualify for ballot access.Each candidate would have to answer the question: "Will you adhere to a -- year term limit?"Term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his or her ideology or party.Three U.S. House members, led by Democrat Larry Smith, have filed briefs asking the court to rule state term limits unconstitutional.The constitutionality of such state term limits may, however, be tested next month.Fashing, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that a particular candidate has no "fundamental" right to ballot access or to run for office.Viewed in this way, term limits imposed by states would be constitutional.Nevertheless, the California decision demolished many of the legal arguments made by incumbents.
