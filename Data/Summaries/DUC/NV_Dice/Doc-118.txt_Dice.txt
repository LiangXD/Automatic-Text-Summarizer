"Liz is a national treasure and when she entered the hospital, I thought it was as important as the President of the U.S. going in and we treated it as such."For somebody like me who is obsessive, it's amazing I was never a gambler," she said at the time.My heart feels big and pounding.But then Liz Taylor, 58, has always lived a life of extremes.If Liz's public is fascinated by her frailties, perhaps reassured somehow by the knowledge that even the gods are vulnerable, their interest is also piqued by the public face she puts on her relentless brushes with illness and addiction.For the tabloid press had been humming with rumors that Liz Taylor had AIDS virtually since she was checked into Daniel Freeman Hospital in Marina del Rey April 9 with a high fever and sinus infection.But the Betty Ford clinic encouraged Taylor only to fight the good fights that had brought her there, rather than take on all addictions -- to drugs and food -- at once.At any rate, the news was good.Typical Liz Taylor."I saw her yesterday and I was really pleased," Sager said Wednesday.Liz Taylor's latest bout with pneumonia has drawn the kind of intense scrutiny normally accorded presidential polyps.Taylor was off a respirator and breathing with the help of an oxygen mask.It was partly to still the gossips that Taylor's doctors called a press conference Wednesday at St. John's Hospital and Medical Center in Santa Monica.But it has been her wrestling matches with weight and addiction that have consistently lured the world's curiosity and, at times, admiration.And even when she was ambushed recently by a Star photographer, Liz couldn't help being, well, Liz.The Taylor wit shone through even Wednesday's press conference, when doctors passed on the actress' desire to "come out and wave at you, but she wasn't in her balcony attire."Taylor's respiratory ailments alone have been a recurring problem.Taylor regained much of the weight, even though she took her drug problems in hand once again in a second stay at the Betty Ford clinic in 1988.And she remains in the intensive-care unit, but she continues to improve and is expected to move to a regular room this weekend, Sam said Thursday.
