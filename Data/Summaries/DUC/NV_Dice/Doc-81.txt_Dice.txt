People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria for many years without getting sick.Seven of the eight TB cases occurred in people who were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before the study began.While most people with the AIDS virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome, people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only about a 10 percent life-long risk of getting TB.
