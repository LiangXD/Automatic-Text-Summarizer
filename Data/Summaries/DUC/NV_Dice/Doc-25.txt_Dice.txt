But the district attorney's office declined to file any charges because the police report failed to show that Gonzalez was involved in the altercation, Brodie said.The district attorney's office declined to file charges against Cornett because, Brodie said, there was insufficient evidence to prove that Cornett brandished a gun.The district attorney's office may have declined to prosecute the suspects because police brutality has been alleged, she said.Officer Robert Camarillo said in a police report that Cornett was arrested in the 3600 block of Taffrail Road on suspicion of brandishing a weapon, resisting arrest and possessing a loaded firearm.McCracken said Flores never struggled with the officers until after he was placed in the choke-hold.Luna, a public works inspector for the city of Port Hueneme, said he walked up to the police car and asked Officer Peter Ruggiero "in a kidding manner" what he was doing in Port Hueneme.But Luna said the Police Department later sent him a letter saying the investigation revealed no wrongdoing on the officers' parts.Prosecution is usually turned down when the arresting officer is suspected of using excessive force, she said.The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Flores but later dismissed all charges during Flores' trial because police failed to turn over a recording of a dispatcher's call requesting that officers investigate the incident at the motorcycle shop, McCracken said.The Police Department declined to release Flores' arrest report because, police officials said, it contains his criminal history.Cole's report said Gonzalez was found hiding in the parking lot and "was bit by a police service dog during the arrest."In an incident April 7, Sergio E. Gonzalez, 19, accused Oxnard officers of ordering a police dog to attack him before he was arrested.But Jean Farley, a supervisor for the Ventura County public defender's office, said it is extremely rare for the district attorney's office not to prosecute a suspect who is accused by police.In a fifth and more recent incident, the district attorney's office declined to file a charge of assaulting an officer against an Oxnard man who says he and several other guests at a June 15 private party were beaten by Oxnard police.The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits against the city, the department or the police officers involved.He said, however, that the decisions by the district attorney's office not to prosecute the suspects do not reflect poorly on the department.The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Luna, but in September, 1988 -- before his trial began -- all charges against him were withdrawn for lack of evidence, Brodie said.A police report said Flores started the fight by shoving a policeman.Flores was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and obstructing an officer.Police had arrested Flores on suspicion of assaulting an officer and of resisting arrest but the district attorney's office decided two weeks later to prosecute Flores on the five misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest.Officers Steven Vendt and Humberto Jimenez were called to assist Ruggiero, the complaint said.Edward Brodie, misdemeanor supervisor for the office, said the decisions not to prosecute the suspects do not necessarily mean that Oxnard police were not justified in making the arrests.But Flores' lawyer, Sherrie L. McCracken, said the report states that officers were at the shop responding to a complaint of a man with a gun.In another incident, Luis C. Luna, 50, alleges in a complaint filed with the city on June 27, 1989, that he was beaten by three officers near a restaurant in Port Hueneme.
