Davidson said he is confident that Latinos will respond to education efforts on diabetes.Nationwide, it is estimated that there are more than 2 million Latinos who already have diabetes, many of them undiagnosed.That is why the American Diabetes Assn. and other health education groups in the Los Angeles area and California have begun a major push to educate Latinos about diabetes.If you have already a predisposed group of people, such as the Latinos, you get more obesity and you get more diabetes."Like heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among Latinos is a condition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors say.Latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are Anglos, and incidence of the disease increases with age.Other barriers to Latinos getting care for diabetes are more subtle, doctors interested in the issue say."We need to give them the opportunity to enter the health care system, and we need to give them the opportunity to learn that diabetes is the biggest health care issue that they are going to face into the year 2000."In addition, Latino diets can be rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote obesity and increase the chance of getting diabetes.The reason is diabetes, a silent killer that afflicts one in eight Latino adults.The effort is being aided by interested physicians and by drug companies, which make insulin and other drugs used for diabetes that can't be controlled by changes in eating habits.Latinos, who often have less access to regular health care than Anglos, are more likely to go undiagnosed, Matkin said.Any Latino woman whose child was born at 9 pounds or larger should consider herself at risk of diabetes and alter her diet, Davidson said.Consuelo and Abuelita aren't actual people, but their story nevertheless is played over and over again among the more than 3 million Latinos in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, health officials say.In one survey done in San Antonio, a third of the Latinos between the ages of 55 and 65 had diabetes, Davidson said.Chief among these is that the Latino patient is less likely to volunteer information or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the Anglo patient, said Dr. Aliza Lifshitz, a board member of the California Hispanic American Medical Assn.Being 20% or more overweight is one of the major diabetes risk factors."We are facing a problem that is going to grow, maybe at epidemic proportions," Davidson said.
