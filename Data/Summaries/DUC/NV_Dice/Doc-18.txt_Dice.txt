Don Jackson, said he set up the self-styled "sting" in Long Beach to expose alleged police racism in the Los Angeles area.The City Council today asked county prosecutors to investigate the conduct of a white policeman who was secretly filmed while he pushed an off-duty black policeman through a plate-glass window.But Jackson's boss said the black officer was looking for trouble.Jackson said he chose Long Beach police because of complaints to the Police Misconduct Lawyer's Referral Service of Los Angeles."The officer simply used violence," Jackson said Monday.Police booked Jackson for investigation of interfering with police and challenging a police officer.Jackson complied, and moments later was pushed through a plate-glass store window.Jackson and a companion were driving through a high-crime area of the city when their car was pulled over and Jackson got out.OK, no problem," said Jackson on the videotape.
