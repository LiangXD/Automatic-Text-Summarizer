This is the story of three groups of scientific sleuths in Antarctica: biologists studying the antifreeze systems of fish; glaciologists examining whether the West Antarctic ice sheet will break apart and flood the world; and cosmologists searching for the birth of galaxies.Glaciologists say Antarctica is responding to the long-term warming of the Earth since the last ice age 18,000 years ago, and to the weird geology of the frozen continent.The ice collector is found.But none of the research has panned out yet, and Dr. DeVries is deeply skeptical it will until scientists understand better how fish and their antifreeze work.If the ice sheet is melting, humans probably aren't to blame.He speculates there may be a kind of "hot spot" in the fish, that melts ice crystals."Things are changing rapidly, and we don't have ways to predict the future" of the ice sheet, Dr. Bentley says.General Foods has experimented with fish antifreeze to see if it can prevent ice crystals from ruining ice cream that's left out of the freezer and put back melted.A Fish Story If it's so cold in Antarctica, why don't the fish freeze?Four groups of glaciologists are setting up camp in West Antarctica to see whether the ice sheet there -- a hunk of ice as big as Greenland -- is beginning to collapse.Some ice streams move a half mile a year, pulling ice from Antarctica's interior to the sea.Ice buildup should overload the spleen and kill the fish, he says, but it doesn't.A continent bigger than America, covered in ice more than a mile thick, Antarctica is isolated by winds and currents that make it the coldest, driest place on Earth.They want to see if ice collects in fish organs, and if it does, how the organs and antifreeze keep the ice in check.The ice inside the fish had grown explosively at the lower temperature, Dr. DeVries explains, wrecking the fish's nervous system and cells.Dr. Testa, a bearded University of Alaska biologist, is trying to learn why so many Antarctic seals starve every few years.Now 52, with a graying walrus mustache and walrus girth, Dr. DeVries is one of the last of the old Antarctic hands still conducting research "on the ice," as the place is called here.Dr. Bentley figures that one ice stream he has studied hasn't moved much since it hit a sticky spot during the Civil War.He plans to drive stakes into the ice along a 90-mile line just below the mouth, and come back two years later to see how far the stakes have moved.Scientists found that the streams changed speed and direction rapidly -- showing the ice sheet as far more unpredictable than imagined.Scientists believe the radiation was produced about 500,000 years after the birth of the universe and is the key to understanding the central paradox of cosmology.
