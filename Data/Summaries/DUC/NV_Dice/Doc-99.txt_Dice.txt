Opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical because the Census Bureau already has printed questionnaires that do not contain any question about legality of residence."The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," Cochran said."There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be unconstitutional but literally impossible," Darby said."Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence," said bureau spokesman James Gorman.In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count."It is going to have a dramatic and disastrous impact in the Hispanic community," Moreno said.At stake are the number of seats in Congress for California, Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis of next year's census."There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of population," Wilson said, adding that those states should receive additional federal aid to cope with the added problems.Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said that Georgia and Indiana both lost House seats after the 1980 Census, and California and New York -- centers of illegal immigration -- each gained seats.
