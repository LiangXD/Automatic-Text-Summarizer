The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.The Southwood report said it is "most unlikely" that the disease poses a threat to humans.The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that BSE is transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of "BSE hysteria" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is "remote."9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.According to a report in the British Medical Journal, the incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is no higher in Britain than it is in countries free of scrapie.The report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies.The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement."I think it is a recognition -- not just of pressure from farmers -- but that the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100% compensation," said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.
