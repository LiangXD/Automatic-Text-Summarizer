If it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu were simply more susceptible to the disease.The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.The kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease since it appeared in cows.The zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
