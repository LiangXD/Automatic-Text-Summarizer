Las Vegas is one of only 15 U.S. cities that can provide the hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention, said Alvin C. Shackleford, a convention spokesman.Las Vegas, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and swingers in recent years, is ready for the Southern Baptists."Las Vegas is probably no more notorious in its pagan qualities than any other city," Hastey said.In addition to bringing in up to $15 million in revenue, the Southern Baptist convention should help the city's image, Powers said."The choice of Las Vegas was deliberate in that the Southern Baptist Convention hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in Las Vegas," said Stan Hastey, executive director of the Southern Baptist Alliance, a moderate group.
