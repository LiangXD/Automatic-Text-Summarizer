Powell's remarks appeared to be directed primarily at the chiefs of Eastern Europe's military organizations, whose future roles in the Warsaw Pact are uncertain as a result of the the major domestic upheavals that have swept their nations."Throughout Eastern Europe we see the dramatic movement toward political pluralism," Powell said.Saying the seminar's task "is to help shape a new order in Europe," Powell defended U.S. military initiatives that have introduced to Europe new, long-range weapons designed to attack Soviet forces sent in to reinforce the first wave of a Warsaw Pact attack on Western Europe.Despite the encouraging signs, the West's key concern remains "the specter of confronting greatly superior forces armed, trained and suited for offensive ground operations," Powell said in prepared remarks at a Vienna session of defense chiefs representing 35 nations from both the East and the West.Contrasting the postwar origin of the Atlantic Alliance with that of the Warsaw Pact, Powell said that in Eastern Europe, "the instruments of war were replaced by the instruments of coercion."This NATO commitment to preserve territorial integrity at every potential point of attack . . . explains the NATO strategy of bringing force to bear on successive echelons of attacking forces," Powell said, noting that NATO would be overwhelmed quickly if it had to face the full brunt of the Warsaw Pact's tank armies.
