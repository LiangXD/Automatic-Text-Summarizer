Critics say the environmental provisions will make science more expensive in Antarctica, already the costliest research site apart from outer space.Of the $193 million the U.S. plans to spend this fiscal year in Antarctica, only $22 million is budgeted for science."We've been living on a tripod-geopolitics, future uses of Antarctica and research," says Guy Guthridge, an NSF Antarctic spokesman.The countries with the strongest commitment to Antarctica may turn out to be the ones that are tied to the continent by nationalism, not science.This year, after a budget battle, more money was appropriated for U.S. Antarctica research, partly by redirecting funds earmarked for housing for the poor.The U.S. Navy for instance, regularly pays for about one-fourth of all oceanographic research, much of it centered on the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica.
