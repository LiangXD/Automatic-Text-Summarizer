The organisers said they were sending a message to Virginia's three wavering congressmen that a 'yes' vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be 'remembered in November'.In Portsmouth, Virginia, one of the last undecided congressmen, Owen Pickett, is in his district office, as he is every weekend.'In Virginia there was slavery, but the slaves were expensive and the people who owned them valued them.'We are absolutely for free trade,' says Mr Bill Diggitt, the state director of Mr Perot's United We Stand.A visit to Congressman Sisisky had not been encouraging, says Mr Beckwith.Mr Josh Greenwood, owner of a small hydroelectric company, says: 'I might run against my congressman myself.'He says he is concerned about the loss of Virginia's tax base as companies move production to Mexico and place continuous downward pressure on wages.'But Nafta undermines our constitution.We were going against a tide of misinformation,' says Ms Kathy Otts, co-captain of Virginians For Nafta.
