It is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- "mad cow" disease -- and few would be prepared to say exactly when and where it will end.Some 8,004 cattle have died from BSE despite being born after the feed ban was introduced.This month 19 cattle have died on farms where MAFF is conducting a seven-year experiment into the disease.MAFF says 5,767 of these were born before the end of 1988, and were probably fed from remaining infected supplies.The ministry believes that the reason more cattle have died is that farmers or food renderers kept using infected feed after the ban."There is no evidence that this disturbing disease can be transferred from cow to calf," Farmers Weekly insisted last week.Last week, MAFF said that the numbers of confirmed BSE cases in the first two months of this year showed a 20 per cent drop over the same period in 1993 -- proof, the ministry says, that the epidemic is waning.Mr North said: "We have more than 8,000 cattle born after the feed ban that have subsequently contracted BSE.More cautiously, MAFF told The Sunday Telegraph: "We have never said we have ruled out the possibility of maternal transmission, but even if it occurs, our scientists do not believe it will do anything other than lengthen the time before the disease is eradicated."
