Lincoln, once the main subsidiary of Mr. Keating's Phoenix, Ariz.-based company, was seized by federal regulators in April 1989, a day after American Continental filed for bankruptcy-court protection.Talking to reporters outside the courtroom, Mr. Keating's attorney, Mr. Neal, said: "The indictment is an effort to retroactively criminalize a whole host of investment transactions that were legitimate when made.Yesterday's federal indictment against Mr. Keating, who was convicted just last week on narrower state securities fraud charges, centered on five separate racketeering schemes.To prevent the transfers from being challenged by the company's creditors, the indictment said, Mr. Keating and others disguised them as loans from a shell company, Medema Homes of Utah.In detailing the alleged $975,000 "insider loans scheme," the indictment said the defendants began transferring the $975,000 to themselves early in 1989.The government also charged that Mr. Keating and the others siphoned off $975,000 from the company for their personal use, even as American Continental prepared in 1989 to seek bankruptcy-law protection.Mr. Keating has said he is broke.In the separate SEC civil case against Mr. Keating, which also names his five co-defendants in the criminal case and four others, the agency charged Mr. Keating with insider trading in connection with the sale of $7.5 million in American Continental common stock.
