Amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetes, he said.In Type II diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body's insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high.The research "opens the door to the scientific study of the disease at a level that wasn't possible before and potentially the mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging," he said.
