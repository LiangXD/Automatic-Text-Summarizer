"It is going to have a dramatic and disastrous impact in the Hispanic community," Moreno said.Opponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical because the Census Bureau has already printed questionnaires that do not contain any question about legality of residence."There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be unconstitutional but literally impossible," Darby said."The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted," Cochran said."Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence," said bureau spokesman James Gorman.In recent weeks, representatives from the census office in Santa Ana have visited such social centers as Abrazar and others and told center staff people that they intend to count "everyone, regardless of where they came from," McDonough said."For example, we have close to 50,000 people in the city that have qualified through the amnesty process for legal residency," Pulido said.In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count.State officials have said California could lose up to $300 million in federal aid if illegal aliens were uncounted.Adrian Dove, assistant regional director for the U.S. Census in charge of outreach, said that despite the Senate's decision, the census bureau "really doesn't know how to go about finding who was legal or illegal."The Senate's action would also have an impact on smaller California cities without substantial Latino populations because census population figures play an important role in Community Development Block Grant formulas, said Don Vestal, Westminster city planner."There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of population," Wilson said, adding that those states should receive additional federal aid to cope with the added problems.At stake are the number of seats in Congress for California, Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis of next year's census.Councilman John Acosta said he "was saddened" by the Senate's action because the city was determined "to count every single person, and I know that (now) we're going to to suffer from this monetarily.""I'm stunned," said Santa Ana City Council member Miguel A. Pulido."Their big thing was, 'We do not care about the origins of where these people are from, but, more importantly, their impact to local economies,' " she said.Gloria McDonough, director of Abrazar Center, an elderly-assistance center for Latinos in Westminster, said the senators' action shows they have no understanding of the impact of illegal immigration to California communities.Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said that Georgia and Indiana both lost House seats after the 1980 Census, and that California and New York -- centers of illegal immigration -- each gained seats.
