Of course, since the passage of the 22nd Amendment in 1951, there is a two-term limit on the presidency, and 29 of the 50 states have some kind of term limit on the governor.Perhaps the best test of executive term limits is to check whether the states with term limits on the governor have performed better or worse than those without such limits.Changes in the seniority system may therefore be a superior alternative to term limits.Legislative term limits are less clear-cut and it is possible to build a respectable case that favors such limits.The voters would be better off if they could reach a binding agreement that precluded the re-election of incumbents, that is, if term limits were instituted.Not surprisingly, the main message is that executive term limits are not an important determinant of economic growth or state spending.The real surprise is that some strong supporters of free markets, such as The Wall Street Journal, have been the biggest advocates of term limits.The only defense for executive term limits is that the electorate needs to be protected against itself, an argument which, if true, would mean that democracy was seriously flawed and would work much less well than it seems to.A problem with term limits is that it creates more lame ducks, who are less responsive to the desires of the electorate.The seniority system could be changed only by getting Congress to alter its own rules (as it has at times in the past) or else by constitutional amendment, which would, from a practical standpoint, also have to initiate in Congress.(It is interesting to note, however, that Hamilton was not discussing term limits on the legislature, and was actually arguing against the term limits on the chief executive that are contained now in the 22nd Amendment.)
