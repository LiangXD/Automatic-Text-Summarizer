Mr Geert Sanders, who works for the Regional Development Authority of West Flanders, says there is already evidence that the region's enhanced communications are attracting new businesses.There is, however, a danger that Belgium will not make the most of the commercial opportunities - 'we will try to attract new industry, but our region is very small and our industrial zones are full,' says Mr Ludo Verstraete, of the Veurne chamber of commerce.Furthermore, Flanders, the area most likely to benefit from the arrival of the tunnel, has recently suffered more rapid increases in unemployment than in Wallonia and the Brussels region.As Mr Verstraete of the Veurne chamber of commerce says: 'Tourism is very important . . . we really have to develop our hotels and tourist infrastructure.'But once again, there is a danger that Belgium will miss out.This is no bad thing for Belgium.The potential for this region is enormous.
