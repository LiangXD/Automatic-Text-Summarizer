Since he was kidnapped, Anderson has been allowed to write a few letters to his family and occasionally to see Lebanese newspaper and television reports about relatives.The Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan said it was sending a 33-foot birthday scroll to Anderson signed by 59 journalists and former colleagues in Tokyo.It was not clear why Mohtashemi, Rafsanjani's main political rival, came to Lebanon.The statement was seen as a response to a declaration Monday by President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran that he would use its influence to free the hostages if the United States released Iranian assets worth up to $12 billion that have been frozen since 1979.Anderson knows his daughter, Sulome, was born June 7, 1985, but has seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed him to watch on Lebanese TV, according to letters from him released by the kidnappers.A knowledgeable Shiite said privately the Islamic Jihad statement was "a clear indication that the hostage-holders are not under Rafsanjani's control."Anderson was a member of the club during a working assignment in Japan 1979-1981.
