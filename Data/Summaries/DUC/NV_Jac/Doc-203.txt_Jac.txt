Eurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable without the high-speed rail link."There is in no sense a feeling we must have that link to make the tunnel successful."Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services.But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits.The high-speed link "will be a benefit for us," he says, "but essential for the country.""If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links."There will be no more talk of crisis," says Alastair Morton, chief executive officer of Eurotunnel PLC, the consortium building the cross-channel link.
