The city's police chief, John Laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society."The matter of police misconduct and brutality has been going on for at least the 21 years I've been here, but I think the deaths pushed the issue beyond the point of tolerance that usually is the case in matters of police misconduct," Glover said.In a letter to police supervisors in mid-February, Laux said: "Let me make one thing perfectly clear _ any act of bias will be dealt with directly and severely."There are bad apples in every bunch and the Minneapolis Police Department is no exception," said Councilwoman Sayles Belton."The key point is that any time the head of the police department cannot hire, fire or impose discipline, you are no longer in charge," he said.I think we're approaching that breaking point," said Van Hayden, 25, a student who says police beat him at the hotel.Our goal is to find out who can offer that to us and in what form," said Laux.
