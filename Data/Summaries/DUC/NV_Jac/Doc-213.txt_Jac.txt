Now, these communities are the year-round home for thousands, often still dependent on volunteer firefighters and an overtaxed network of roads and water lines.; "On a good day, trying to maneuver fire apparatus on those roads is tough," said Steve Cavallero, a battalion chief for the Redwood City Fire Department, which covers a portion of Emerald Lake Hills.Now, in the wake of that firestorm, local firefighters are looking up at the hills that surround this area and wondering not whether, but only when and where.; "I know it's there," said Saratoga Fire Chief Ernest Kraule.Instead of an eight- or 10-inch water main ensuring pressure for fire hoses, the mountains are laced with two-inch pipes.; "Those are the risks you take when you live in an area like this," said Dean Lucke, chief of the forestry department's San Mateo-Santa Cruz ranger unit.By not trimming dense brush, he said, some homeowners are "virtually signing a death warrant."; And increasingly, fire officials worry about wildfires spreading into even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills, where numerous trees create an "urban forest."; "We could have a fire going from rooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city, if the weather conditions are right," said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Osby.; The lesson of the Oakland hills, firefighters say, is to contain and extinguish even the smallest fires as quickly as possible.
