At the same time, it was disclosed that federal officials are probing the possibility that Exxon's 987-foot oil tanker was on autopilot shortly before it ran aground and that the electronic navigation aid confused the crew and contributed to the accident."We want the oil industry to be ready for a spill of this magnitude if it happens tomorrow," Cowper said.-- The names of 12 oil spill-response team members who do nothing but respond to oil spills and who are available for such duty 24 hours a day.In one proposed draft of an order, continuation of routine operations at the Alyeska Marine Terminal near the town of Valdez is described as creating "a substantial potential risk of additional oil spill" because the consortium has failed to demonstrate it can manage a large spill with minimal environmental effects.An aide to the governor described the companies' response as "generally OK" but said that Cowper may issue an order putting his plan into effect anyway.A Coast Guard official in Anchorage said the third mate in charge of the tanker shortly before it went aground did complain of being unable to get the vessel to respond to the helm.Backed by public antipathy toward the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster, Gov.If it isn't complied with, we don't have any remedy available to us except shut down the terminal.After meeting personally with top executives from three of the seven oil companies that own the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. earlier in the week, Cowper asked them to respond by noon Thursday to his six-point safety plan."That should be the first clue to people on the bridge that the autopilot is on."Coast Guard spokesman Bruce Pimental in Valdez said investigators still are trying to determine if the autopilot actually was used the night of the accident and if it was, when it was turned off.The nation's worst oil spill penetrated a national park Thursday, with an airborne spotter "seeing an oil sheen up on some of the rocks and seeing staining on the rocks" at Kenai Fjords National Park, park spokesman John Quinley said.-- A limit of one tanker being loaded at a time until all designated cleanup equipment is in place, and the end of all loading within 72 hours if cleanup equipment is not ready."There is going to have to be a plan that satisfies us, our people, and it will be tough.
