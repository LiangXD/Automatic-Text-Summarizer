Five weeks ago, in his triumphant speech to Congress, President Bush said that "our commitment to peace in the Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait."The U.S. is committed to support the U.N., and the U.N. is now committed to inserting itself deeply into the internal affairs of Iraq.It is most implausible that Saddam Hussein could survive as Iraq's dictator and comply with these terms.Well, Saddam Hussein may be twice as brutal as Lenin, but he is only one-tenth as smart.Since Mr. Bush has just succeeded in turning the U.N. into a useful instrument for enhancing world order, he can't let Saddam Hussein steal his success.Now the U.N. is committed to implementing the destruction of all of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons, longer-range ballistic missiles, and nuclear materials and components.Between the invasion of Kuwait last August and the end of the Gulf war, many brave souls inside and outside the U.S. government worried about clever stratagems that Saddam Hussein might employ to defeat the U.S.If international security guarantees were to fail in this instance, the deal that could be offered to Israel would no longer be "territory for peace," but territory for a worthless U.N. document.
