It will be the last chance to see a total solar eclipse this century.An eclipse is an astronomical coincidence.Most hotels along the eclipse route are full for July 11.On July 11, the moon will pass between the planet and the sun, abruptly swallowing midday's light, except for a weird glow on the horizon.Mexico, where sun worship has passed from ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers, is gearing up early for the day next year when the sun will be blotted out.But the special government commission, Eclipse 1991, is banking on the clouds to roll in the country's financial favor.
