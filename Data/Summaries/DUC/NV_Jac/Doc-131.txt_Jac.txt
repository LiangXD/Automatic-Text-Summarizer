It also was the first time Kristiansen had beaten Samuelson in a marathon.It had been at least eight years since Samuelson was beaten in the marathon by an American.It was the first time since 1963 that an Ethiopian had run at Boston and Mekonnen, 24, made the most of it.For the first few miles, before the heat, Kristiansen was running at a 2:17 pace.Joan Benoit Samuelson, who set a world record on this course in 1983, was beset with physical problems that altered her stride at 11 miles, and she finished ninth among the women in 2:37:52."I was prepared for hot weather and it certainly was hot, but the heat wasn't my problem today," Samuelson said."I've run some very good races and I think I have some very good races left in me," she said.It was only the second time an African has won here.Samuelson, who holds the U.S. marathon record, said she will significantly decrease her training mileage and probably run shorter races.One of the marathon's most enduring figures was Bikila, who won the marathon gold medal in 1960 and 1964.He was among the pack of four African runners that led the 6,418 entrants race for 15 miles.In two days, Ethiopian runners have won three major marathons."It was too hot to set the world record."But the story of Monday's 93rd Boston race was Mekonnen and his nation of 42 million, which has reemerged as a force to be reckoned with in marathon running.I was right where I wanted to be.By her own reckoning, it was at almost 16 miles that Kristiansen felt the heat.In an emotional news conference afterward, Samuelson, who won the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984 at Los Angeles, tearfully conceded that she might have run her last marathon for some time.I think it's great that she finished.""I felt real easy the first 11 miles, I felt I was right in the groove.Weidenbach was fifth.Ethiopia's legacy to the world in the last decade has been one of drought, famine and ethnic civil war.Also on Sunday, in the World Cup Marathon at Milan, Ethiopians finished 1-2.And they ran not as strangers, because Mekonnen had beaten Ikangaa in winning last year's Tokyo Marathon.I think I need to take an indefinite rest.And still another, Wodajo Bulti, who has run 2:08:44, is one of the favorites in the London Marathon next Sunday.In the postrace news conference, the private Samuelson was as emotional as she has ever been in public.
