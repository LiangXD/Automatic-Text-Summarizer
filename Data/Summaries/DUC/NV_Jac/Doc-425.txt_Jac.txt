Japanese billionaire Masao Nangaku, who bought the Dunes Hotel and Casino two years ago for $157 million, is planning a 35-story high-rise office building and 300-room nongaming hotel in downtown Las Vegas.Don Woodsmall, who serves with Morichika as project manager of the Cosmo World project, said Las Vegas was picked by the Japanese company, in part, "because the housing market is so strong here."Snow is seeking a new site for the project because some landowners in downtown Las Vegas balked at selling their property.Izumi, who looked at properties in Hawaii but opted for Las Vegas because of the lower costs, has committed $30 million for the purchase and renovation of the hotel."More than half the Japanese tourists who come to Los Angeles will also come to Las Vegas," said Yoshi Morichika, who is heading up a 1,274-acre golf and destination resort community for Japanese recreation and electronics giant Cosmo World.The same source said the Japanese had taken over depressed properties and kept them open "and any stride forward is a positive sign."Cosmo World's resort project is expected to cost $200 million by the time it's completed in 1993."This area is very attractive to the Japanese businessman," Izumi said.
