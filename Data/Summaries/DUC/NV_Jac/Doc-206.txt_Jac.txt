"This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island," said a construction union official.Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.26, after the digging for much of the tunnel is finished.It's the first time we have air passing between the two tunnels," said Gordon Crighton, tunnel engineering manager.The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting for its total length of 31 miles.The first coupling of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.Tuesday's linkup in the service tunnel is described by the French as a "mouse ole" - a bore only two inches in diameter.Two Japanese-designed boring machines are drilling the tunnel.The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.
