"I was concentrating on running five-minute miles," he said.At 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun."To be honest with you, I was afraid of Cathy (O'Brien)," she said.It was the slowest winning time in this race since 1982.In the women's race, Weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with that handicapping."I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went," Davies-Hale said.It was the same spot, the corner of Wells and North Avenue, that Weidenbach had taken the lead in last year's race.It was the second-hottest race in Chicago history, only 1978 was worse.Davies-Hale may have shown a liking for running in heat when he won the Boulder Bolder that year in terrific heat.Given the heat, the humidity and the wind, Weidenbach's time might have been as much as two minutes faster.O'Brien was third in 2:31:19.Following him, and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the Soviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British Midlands, who was third in 2:13:37.Still, Davies-Hale is unsure what his future in the marathon is.By comparison, last year's race was 30 degrees cooler at the start.No one who was in the lead pack at the halfway point, with the exception of Montero, finished in the top five.Ann Cody Morris won the women's wheelchair race in 1:58:51.Even the 2:28 is respectable -- only five U.S. women have run under 2:30.
