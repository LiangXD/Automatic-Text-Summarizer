The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought received _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief measure.Despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought.Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected $248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop insurance.To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought payments were matched county by county in a computer database.Government officials say they did the best they could with a rushed program.By the time checks were being written at the county level, the AP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even "ineffective herbicide."Because much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties, reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific farmers, also available under the FOIA.Gresham readily offers that he and his son operate their farms under five different names precisely because of federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000 per farmer.Loopholes were tightened in 1989's smaller $1 billion drought relief program."It was there, so I took it," said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and corn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because hail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated farm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year.The AP found some farmers who did better than just luck out.
