Patten makes endless allusions to what is good about the Hong Kong system and what is bad about the Chinese system, one obvious example being the way the two governments level with the people.7. In his annual report to the Legislative Council, Patten noted subtly and not so subtly that where Hong Kong was free to make up its mind, things had gone well in the past year, but where consultation with China was necessary, nothing seemed to have worked well.A major incompatibility in Sino-Hong Kong relations is that the sovereign body, namely China, is large but backward, whereas Hong Kong, which has no sovereignty, is small but advanced.If China continues its negative attitude toward Hong Kong, what sort of price will it have to pay?3. Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council is replete with praises for the people of Hong Kong, for their accomplishments, and for the superiority of the Hong Kong system, calling it a miracle of human society.As for making the Hong Kong system "living, automatic, and autonomous," the relations between China and the special entity of Hong Kong, how the two should be integrated and to what extent, as well as the costs and benefits of such integration... none of that has been considered at length.He may still be impenetrably thick-headed, but he has mellowed considerably and become more practical.After Patten came to Hong Kong, the Chinese could no longer keep acting anti-democratic.Now Patten takes life in Hong Kong as his point of departure, arguing that democratic politics of a high quality are what the people of Hong Kong need to maintain the "Hong Kong system."(Section 174) "The reason is that we still have not been able to convince Chinese officials that Hong Kong citizens' expectations about the development of their political system are in no way excessive but are reasonable and should be met, that they form part of the natural evolution of a society as it matures and becomes more sophisticated.The people of Hong Kong might blame the Chinese Government for the delay in solving all those problems that need to be tackled urgently.However, if they give way, they would be handing a victory to Patten.One year after arriving in Hong Kong, Patten has certainly commanded much authority with his solid political ideas.The way Christopher Patten talked last year, you would have thought he were in Britain."...outstanding achievements have been scored on all fronts during the past year...with one lone exception," which was Hong Kong's effort to "further its understanding with China" and "replace unproductive speculation with sincere trust."(Section 182) Patten took the initiative to define the relations between China and Hong Kong, giving substance to their contacts as well as clarifying the nature of such relations.China has always looked at Hong Kong unilaterally from top to bottom, demanding that it fall in line with China and not the other way round.The fact of the matter is that these expectations can be met within the framework of "one nation, two systems."It is hard for the Chinese to sing the praises of the Hong Kong system, Hong Kong people, and Hong Kong society.If they continue to insist that Patten is guilty of the "three violations" and refuse to make adjustments and concessions, they would have a lot of ideological work to do on the Hong Kong people, besides giving Patten a reason to withdraw from the talks.What should be China's attitude now?Even more striking is the open dialogue and debate that took place in an atmosphere of freedom between Patten and the people of Hong Kong on an equal plane after the governor presented his second annual report (in which the Chinese authorities also played an active part).What the Chinese wanted to prove was that Patten would not be able to accomplish a thing without China's cooperation, that he would end up with not just one broken leg, but two broken legs.Patten said, "When many places in the world identify with Hong Kong's value system and seek to duplicate its success story, would the world become a better place, a more prosperous place?1. Abandoning his "from politics to politics" stance, which is that politics is self-justifying and self-sufficient, Patten has now woven politics into the lives of the people of Hong Kong, making it part and parcel of the local way of life and inseparable from the war on corruption, the rule of law, freedom, education, and the quality of governance -- all "perennial concerns" in Chinese society.
