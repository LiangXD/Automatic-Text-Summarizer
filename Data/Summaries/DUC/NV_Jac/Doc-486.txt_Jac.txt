Scientists had to be sure there would be that many in bloom every day of the year.Plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands in Biosphere II.In all, some 3,800 species of plant and animal life are being invited to the party, and as in the original Eden, snakes.It is the professional nature of engineers and architects to keep the outside world out.The oxygen is breathed in by humans and animals who breathe out carbon dioxide which is breathed in by the plants and used in photosynthesis which produces more oxygen.In short, this small world in some cases is too small for its own good.Probably the first to consider Earth and its environment as a biosphere was a Soviet scientist, V.I. Vernadsky in 1926.Now suddenly they had to devise ways to keep the wild world in.In the beginning, or near it, they suggested that oxygen was sparse and so most of the early creatures were anaerobic bacteria that didn't need oxygen.Biosphere II is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural proclivity of water.So Dr. Tony Burgess of the University of Arizona patterned the deserts after those of Baja California where the cactus and other plants have learned to live with ocean fog.
