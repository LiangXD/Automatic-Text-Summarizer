The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the "mad cow" scare."Mad cow" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry.Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently.On Friday, West Germany joined France in a ban on British beef imports, citing health fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)."BSE has been around for six or seven years," said David Lewis of the Meat and Livestock Commission.No one is certain what causes the disease, which affects the cow's brain.Mad cow disease has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 14,000 cows since it was first noticed in the mid-1980s.On May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that a Siamese cat had died from a disease identical to BSE.
