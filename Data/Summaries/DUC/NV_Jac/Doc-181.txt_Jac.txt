Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually occurred.But Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around the equator and winds for "El Nino" periods, when eastern Pacific waters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of when or where a hurricane might form.Drought in West Africa is responsible for a drop in Atlantic hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, Gray said.
