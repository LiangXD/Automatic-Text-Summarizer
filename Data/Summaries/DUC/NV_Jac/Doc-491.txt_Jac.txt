Powell told lawmakers that as the President's principal military adviser in a time of shrinking budgets, he would "rather have (a force) that is smaller, as long as it's always ready to perform, as advertised, and when called upon.""I have no reservations and I know that none of my colleagues have any reservations," said Powell.Reflecting the rising skepticism, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) told Powell: "We certainly, I think, have to be prepared for backward steps to occur in the Soviet Union."It's very premature to start basing any of our plans and programs and actions" on assumptions of Gorbachev's success, said Powell.Nunn said that Powell offered "tremendous . . . talent, insight, and experience."1. The committee action came after several hours of a confirmation hearing at which Powell told the panel that he has "some level of confidence" that reforms might succeed in the Soviet Union.The Senate panel voted 20 to 0 to recommend Powell's nomination to the full Senate.(that) can be diverted from other missions, other training activities, to work with the Border Patrol and see if we can do a better job of sealing the border between the United States and Mexico," said Powell.(D-Tenn.) called Powell's appointment "one of the finest appointments that our President has made."
