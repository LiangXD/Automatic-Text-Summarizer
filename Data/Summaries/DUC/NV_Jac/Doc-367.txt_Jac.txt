Among consequences of this trend toward politicization of the courts, Bork said, is that "we may expect (judicial) confirmation battles that are increasingly bitter.In his own confirmation hearings, "many senators wanted political results from the courts," Bork said.On the matter of Bork's leanings on possible Supreme Court action on the abortion issue, "I was told by two Republican senators that they would vote against me because I might vote to overturn Roe against Wade," Bork said.The angry sessions were marked by a level of communication that was "not very high," Bork said.Constitutional law, in short, Bork said, has come to be seen as "a political weapon."In that spirit, one of the latest to join the parade of let-me-tell-you-my-side authors is Robert H. Bork, the former appeals court judge who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Reagan but was rejected by the Senate.But this "tempting," or political manipulation of the courts, long predated his attempt to secure a seat on the Supreme Court, Bork said.Whereas the Constitution specified that laws were to be made by legislators who were elected by the people, not judges appointed by the President, Bork said, "a lot of Americans now simply assume that the courts should produce results they like rather than sticking to the Constitution."By politicizing the courts, Bork elaborated, Americans have eaten away at "the people's right to legislate the laws we want to live by."Both sides, Bork said, "regard the court as in large part not a legal institution, but a political body.""At bottom," he said, his new book is "about legal theory.""So far as they were concerned, for their purposes, the Supreme Court was their branch."His unsuccessful bid for a seat on the nation's highest court forms only a part of his book, Bork said.Many feared his effect on Supreme Court decisions because they said he already was too arrogant when contending that his interpretations of the law were the ones that best matched the original intent of the framers of the Constitution.Though without its subtitle, "The Political Seduction of the Law," a book called "The Tempting of America" does sound rather like a collection of regional dessert recipes, Bork maintains that mass assumption explains "the great temptation," expecting "political results from the courts."
