"It's possible they could avoid the oil," Brown said.An experiment to assess the possibility of burning off the oil was completed early Sunday and the Coast Guard said Exxon officials were "cautiously optimistic.""It's Exxon's policy that in the waters that the ship was located in, the captain should have been on the bridge," Dunphy said.The Coast Guard said about 84,000 gallons of oil an hour was being transferred; at that rate, the unloading could take seven days.The tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday.The Coast Guard said the slick and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of about 100 square miles.Ott said fishing is an economic mainstay in Cordova, more so than in Valdez, which also draws tourists and has the oil terminal."This oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit Alaska since the Good Friday earthquake 25 years ago," Cowper said in a news release.However, the wind and waves may make it more difficult to skim oil off the water, said Coast Guard Lt.Hazelwood was in his cabin at the time of the accident, Iarossi said.More than four miles of floating boom had been placed in an effort to contain the oil, the Coast Guard said Sunday.By late Sunday, Exxon officials said a total of 37,500 barrels of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation, leaving more than 900,000 barrels on the ship.However, Exxon insisted that the area was only 10 to 12 square miles, and Coast Guard officials said they were at a loss to explain the difference in estimates.The Coast Guard said it ordered the closure to prevent pollution from being carried to Valdez on vessels passing through the oil.
