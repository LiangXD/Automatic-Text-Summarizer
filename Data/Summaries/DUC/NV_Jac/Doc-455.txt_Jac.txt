This integration is most visible in the way Hong Kong's trade has changed over the past six years.But for the re-export trade, Hong Kong would have a visible trade deficit with the rest of the world because it is becoming more of a service area and transferring some of its manufacturing to south China.The economic integration of Hong Kong with China is, considering that it has occurred just over the past 10 years, nothing short of astonishing.Yet Mr Patten's main task is to preside over the peaceful transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997.This change in Hong Kong's economy could not have happened without the historic change of course China embarked upon in 1979.WHEN Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's newly-appointed governor, arrives in the colony in July he will find that, five years away from its reversion to Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong is thriving.There have been cases of Hong Kong Chinese returning to the colony but this is hardly surprising given that their most popular destinations - Canada, the US and Australia - have all been suffering economic downturns.This group also seeks a non-confrontational policy towards China, believing that it is better to work with the future ruler than to antagonise it.To judge by the stock market, property prices, and bilateral trade with and investment in China, Hong Kong appears to have come to terms with its future ruler.During that time Hong Kong has reverted to a role it occupied before the Second World War: that of entrepot for China's trade with the outside world.
