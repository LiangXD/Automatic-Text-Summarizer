A signal that relations between Yugoslavia and Slovenia might be reconsidered came this time from the Slovene capital.In the view of Yugoslav diplomats, the normalization of relations between Slovenia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will certainly be a strenuous and long-term project.Slovenia is the former Yugoslav republic that made the greatest effort to harm the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.We are, of course, interested in normal relations between Slovenia and Yugoslavia, but some prerequisites have to be fulfilled," Jovanovic concluded his statement.There are many situations that prove that Slovenia has a hostile attitude toward Yugoslavia.In the focus of Serbian attention now are relations with Croatia, and as far as Slovenia is concerned, the official proposal for the normalization of relations has to be specified first.We are not bothered that Slovenia is an independent state.It is also true that Slovenia does not accept Yugoslavia on the international scene.
