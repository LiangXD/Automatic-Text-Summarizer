Carlucci says that Powell has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that Reagan got Powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the general had turned Carlucci down several times."Colin gets mad at me when I say this, but I think he should go to the very top of the military establishment _ up to and including chairman of the joint chiefs of staff," Carlucci has said.On personal level, however, Powell doesn't always keep up with the times.On the job, Powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he became FORSCOM commander.Powell's daily interests are more pressing: Keeping his troops ready for combat "with the hope they will never be needed."Gen. Colin L. Powell, who is expected to be named the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is described by colleagues as a "soldier's soldier" who doesn't particularly like staff jobs.
