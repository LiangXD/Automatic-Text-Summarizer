The researchers said the drug is easy to produce and thus is likely to be less expensive than other cancer treatments."It's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments.""There aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay away for as long as four years," says Lawrence Piro, chief of cancer research at Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation, La Jolla, Calif., where the drug was developed.About 50% to 60% of patients -- most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the drug, some with complete remission, he said.Dr. Piro said 2-CdA has also been used effectively in initial trials to treat more common cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.As the disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to infection and often need blood transfusions.Hoffmann-La Roche is the U.S. subsidiary of F.
