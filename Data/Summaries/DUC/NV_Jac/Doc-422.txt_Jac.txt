Las Vegas has grown from a dusty town of a few resorts into a booming metropolis of more than 600,000 people, with nearly 60,000 hotel and motel rooms to accomodate tourists.When finished sometime late next year, the $550 million resort will have 3,200 guest rooms set in a watery tropical setting that hotel officials claim will be like nothing Las Vegas has ever seen.Already boasting the world's two largest resort hotels, Las Vegas soon will have five hotel-casinos with more than 3,000 rooms apiece.Tourism is growing and the gaming and resort industries are attempting to capitalize on the trend.More than 30 years ago, Life magazine took a look at the burgeoning little desert town of Las Vegas and wondered if it wasn't overbuilt."There is still a tremendous amount of demand out there that hasn't been satisified," said Rossi Ralenkotter, director of marketing for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.Nearly 20,000 new hotel rooms either are under construction or awaiting groundbreaking, as resorts compete to add rooms they hope will bring in even more tourists and gamblers in the near future."Has Las Vegas pushed its luck too far?"
