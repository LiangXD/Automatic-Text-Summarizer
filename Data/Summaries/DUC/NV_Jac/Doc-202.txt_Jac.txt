A smaller service tunnel running between them now is being dug.The tunnels are to be completed in 1991, then the railroad tracks will be laid.Another is digging from the French coast in what the tunnel builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way in the world.The tunnel, 80-130 feet below the seabed, was 2 miles into the channel from this end Oct.At its peak, the project will employ about 11,000 workers and 11 tunneling machines."People still question whether the tunnel will be complete in May 1993 and that's ridiculous," says Kathy Watson, co-author of a book on the project.A colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of Dover, pursuing a dream born in Napoleon's time that is coming true at last.Because the machines are too large to be removed, when the digging is complete they will be rolled aside and walled in.Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium that will own the tunnel, is urging British Rail to speed its plans.
