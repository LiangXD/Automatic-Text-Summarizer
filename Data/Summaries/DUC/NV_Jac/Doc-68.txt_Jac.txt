The nuns' affirmative action for Clarence Thomas was the only effective, meaningful kind: the kind we perform for individuals, not because it is state-mandated but because it is right, not because we love a race but because we care for people and love our country.Not that the hearings will be color blind, it's just that senators are going to use Mr. Thomas's race to prove things about themselves with it.Some on the right will use Mr. Thomas's race to demonstrate again that ours is the party of true racial progress, that not a trace of racism clogs the conservative heart.But the lesson that should not be lost is the transcendent one: Clarence Thomas made it in America because he was loved.Mr. Thomas's appointment is not a traducing of the people's will but a fulfillment of their directive. --- Miss Noonan is a writer in New York.Those on the left are unmoved by Mr. Thomas's climb from nothing to something because he didn't do it the right way -- through them and with their programs.What about those poor blacks not greatly gifted or guided -- what about them?" --- For Judge Thomas's proponents, two great hopes: One is that the administration will hit America where it lives and go over the heads of the talking suits and straight to the people, presenting as witnesses on television the affirmative action crew that lifted a young boy with nothing to great heights -- the mother who was a maid, the grandmother who saved up the tuition and the nuns who helped open his eyes.
