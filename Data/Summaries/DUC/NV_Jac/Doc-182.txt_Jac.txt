"I spoke to about 5,000 people on the west coast of Florida," Sheets said.And only one satellite is available for tracking hurricanes."We'd like to be able to see all the way to Africa," which is where Atlantic hurricanes develop, he said.Last season, 505 people died in Atlantic hurricanes, including Gilbert and Joan.Since 1985, Sheets said, there seem to be more hurricanes and they're more likely to hit the United States."We may be in an upswing," he said, "possibly back to the pattern of the '40s, '50s and '60s when we had a tremendous number of landfall hurricanes."
