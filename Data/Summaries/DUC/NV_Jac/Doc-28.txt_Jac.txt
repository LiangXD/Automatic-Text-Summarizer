Mr. Gates opposed the Police Corps because its members would not be professionals.Similarly, Mr. Gates vehemently opposed the Police Corps Program backed by other police chiefs.Many chiefs openly disagreed with Mr. Gates when he opposed the Police Corps Bill in Congress.Through the years Mr. Gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing, in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime.It is hard to see how the Los Angeles Police Department can regain credibility unless Daryl Gates's leave becomes permanent.Public opinion polls in Los Angeles show the majority of people believe police brutality is common, and they disapprove of the way Mr. Gates has done his job.Or was the chief suggesting that the beating was a warning against further run-ins with the police?Even more recently, Mr. Gates told the Senate that "casual drug users should be taken out and shot."The presence of even one police corps officer witness would have deterred the criminal cops.
