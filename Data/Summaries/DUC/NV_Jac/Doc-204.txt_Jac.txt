Eurotunnel Chairman Andre Benard said the company has provided for any foreseeable problems, but stressed: "We always made it very clear that this was a risk project.""We will have the money to finish the project," says Alastair Morton, British deputy chairman of Eurotunnel, the privately owned Anglo-French company overseeing the work.The "Chunnel" between Britain and France is half-dug and scheduled to open on time in three years.It's been described as the largest current civil engineering project, a multibillion dollar link that will help revolutionize Europe's economy and physically end Britain's historic isolation, a dream born in Napoleon's day.Eurotunnel says is can survive without a new link.Eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent of Britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the first year.Assuming banks approve, the project would have a total of about $14.6 billion in debt and equity financing.The project also has raised increasing hostility among many Britons, who fear it will provide an easy conduit for ills from the continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.The Chunnel project also has been marred by eight accidental deaths on the site.
