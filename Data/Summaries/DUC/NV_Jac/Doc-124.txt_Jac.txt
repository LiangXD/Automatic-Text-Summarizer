Recent election results have shown, too, that simply being tough on guns is not enough to woo the voters.In the process they have lost touch with many of their members, who back gun control in general and specifically the Brady bill.Despite its uncertain effect, passage of the Brady bill is read by some as a sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control.The message from an outraged public is not, however, unequivocally in favour of gun control.They point to glaring failings in the federal government's policing of the 276,000 licensed gun dealers in the US as evidence of the Brady bill's likely ineffectiveness.Such beliefs have led the NRA to campaign against restrictions on machine guns, assault weapons and armour-piercing bullets.Virginia has passed a law restricting people to one gun purchase a month.Second, the NRA's insistence on combating any gun control, even that viewed as reasonable by a majority not just of the US population but of gun-owners, has driven away some former political and police supporters.Advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over stubborn resistance by Republican senators from western states such as Idaho and Alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the US.
