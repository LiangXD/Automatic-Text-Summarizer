The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that BSE was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.The Southwood report said it was "most unlikely" that the disease was a threat to humans.9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
