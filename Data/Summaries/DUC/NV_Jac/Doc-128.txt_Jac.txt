I said that although the Second Amendment has nothing to do with private uses of arms, there is an unenumerated but undeniable right to own a gun.In the same way, the right to own a gun is not disparaged by being licensed or otherwise regulated and controlled.The real issue is that the Second Amendment addressed a serious public concern, to protect the right of citizens to serve as defenders of the community in times of peril, not the personal uses of guns.
