Keefe testified about giving polygraph tests to three Pan Am baggage handlers in Frankfurt, West Germany, during his appearance before the grand jury, said a source familiar with the case.Keefe's appearance before the grand jury indicates U.S. authorities are stepping up their investigation of the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 259 passengers and crew members and 11 people on the ground.Keefe told the panel two of the three baggage handlers failed the polygraph tests when they said they knew nothing about the transfer of a piece of luggage to Flight 103, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
