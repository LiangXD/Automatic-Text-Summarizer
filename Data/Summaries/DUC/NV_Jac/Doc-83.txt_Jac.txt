Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today.This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.By contrast, blacks are genetically more resistant than whites to malaria, which is common in Africa.In the population at large, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as whites.About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the United States, resulting in 1,700 deaths.In homes where the initial source of the disease was white, 17 percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites caught the infection."We found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks," said Dr. William W. Stead.
