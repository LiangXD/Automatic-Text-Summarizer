The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions.Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in borrowing to fund the welfare state.In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these.And the demands put on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private provision of pensions and healthcare.The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support.While short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since the second world war.The ageing of the population has also contributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions.Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.But a new glue will be needed over the next 50 years if advanced economies are to pass beyond the welfare state.Increases in life expectancy have already increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions.Total government spending in the OECD countries has risen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990.Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.In a global economy, no country can long afford to burden business with higher welfare costs than its neighbours.Average government debt in OECD countries has risen from 23 per cent of GDP in 1979 to 44 per cent in 1992.The maturing of the welfare state is also a significant factor in the doubling of health expenditure since 1960.In some countries, the increase has been relatively moderate - 20 per cent or less in countries such as France, Japan and Switzerland.The strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by relating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age.
