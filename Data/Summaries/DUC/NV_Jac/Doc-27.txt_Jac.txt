The officer who shot Barnes was a two-year veteran of the force.Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong.It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year.Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens.Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said."This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr. Barnes' family and for this officer," Bishop said.No officer involved in the two killings was charged.
