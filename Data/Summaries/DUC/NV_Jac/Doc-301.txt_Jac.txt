The Northwest Airlines jet that crashed Sunday in Detroit, killing at least 154 people, was involved in two incidents of engine failure in the past two years.Sunday's crash was the first time in 24 years that passengers were killed in an accident involving a Northwest plane.A Northwest spokesman said the engines involved in those two incidents had since been replaced by other JT8D-200 series engines.FAA records show that besides those incidents that involved the plane that crashed, problems with the turbine sections of JT8D-200 series engines occurred on three Republic flights in the past four years.John Lauber, one of five members of the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a news conference at a hotel near the airport last night that there was no evidence at this point that either engine exploded or caught fire during flight.The MD-82 jet, which has a good safety record, is designed to be able to take off and land even if one engine fails.Thomas Haueter, of the safety recommendations staff of the safety agency, said that the board hadn't put out an emergency recommendation for immediate replacement of the pins because it was unclear if the problems that had occurred were merely isolated incidents or reflected system problems.The worst airline accident ever in the U.S. was the 1979 crash of an American Airlines jet in Chicago.According to Associated Press reports, some witnesses to the crash, including an air traffic controller, said they saw blue flame coming from one of the jetliner's engines just before it hit the ground and exploded into a fireball.The JT8D-219 engines used on the jet have been the subject of some concern among federal safety officals.The board made the recommendation after a March 23 incident in which an American Airlines MD-82 plane approaching the Minneapolis airport experienced an engine surge and loss of power.More than 900 of the engines have been manufactured, according to the board.Why the Northwest airliner failed to make the climb and whether it was carrying too much weight will be subjects for federal investigators, he said."Aviation is going to be a hot topic," said an aide to Sen.The engine, a JT8D-217A, was shut down, and the plane landed without further trouble.The accident, the second-deadliest ever in the U.S., could have a broad range of effects on the airline industry regardless of the specific causes, aviation specialists said.An FAA official said all jetliners, in order to be certified, must be capable of completing their takeoff ascent even if one engine fails, provided the aircraft is within prescribed weight limits.Later inspection revealed extensive turbine damage to the engine, the FAA report said.Though federal investigators were looking into a number of possible causes for the crash, which occurred shortly after takeoff, engine failure appeared to be a likely culprit."There is going to be a lot of noise from Capitol Hill," said John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute.In its April report, the National Transportation Safety Board warned that "many" of the 330 MD-80 series airplanes operated by 12 U.S. and 14 foreign airlines world-wide "are potential candidates" for engine failure.
