"What we're doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at Drexel)," in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital, Milken says, although he no longer trades or underwrites securities.Milken says that, in all, he has been approached by several hundred companies.And it is working on finding new capital for successful companies and refinancing firms that are in trouble.He says that 12 of these already are at the point where a transaction has occurred or is about to.Milken, who was one of the most feared competitors on Wall Street when he was at Drexel, now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and underwriting business that he can no longer do himself.Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, says the firm hasn't lost any clients to ICAG.But one clue to the amount of money that Milken personally is committing to the firm is how much he says ICAG is willing to invest in an individual transaction.And in a long interview in ICAG's offices, Milken confirmed that a significant part of ICAG's business will be with ordinary companies.Milken says ICAG plans to do this for other employee-owned companies as well, since many of them have trouble raising the money to buy equipment outright.But Milken maintains that he is simply doing what he has always done, advising companies to profit from market conditions.Only the firm's name, not Milken's, is on the door.Milken says his firm expects to help salvage some of the large companies that have been in the news in the last couple of months because of severe difficulties in meeting the payments on their junk debt.In an off-the-record interview, the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively said that he couldn't afford to have any formal business relationship with ICAG."It's a private firm," he says.Officials at the new firm say they are aren't making overtures to lure Drexel employees to ICAG.One ICAG staff member says Milken's old competitors today are more than happy to do business with him, now that he's no longer directly competing.Milken won't comment on the terms on which ICAG is helping these companies, but one deal that fell through suggests that, while his aim may be to help others, he isn't neglecting his own interests.At Drexel, Milken essentially created the market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, and he revolutionized the way that capital was raised for medium-sized U.S. companies.When Drexel settled a massive SEC lawsuit, the firm agreed not to do business "directly or indirectly" with Milken.Since leaving Drexel, Milken has had talks with many of his old firm's clients, according to a senior Drexel executive.Milken and staff members say they are hoping for the best and, no matter what happens, they expect ICAG to remain in business and grow.Some banks, he said, "have decided that Milken is not a credible person right now."When Drexel's former junk bond chief announced plans for the firm, he said it would help members of minority groups and unions raise the capital to own companies."The reality is that we can generate a lot of business for people," the staff member says.Milken's new company, International Capital Access Group, is open for business.Milken, however, protests any suggestion that the firm's main purpose is to make money.(Milken says he doesn't know how many.)But the new firm is also gearing up for a considerable amount of potentially more profitable business.In addition to these areas, Milken already is doing a considerable amount of mainstream business."There are some companies today that aren't knocking the cover off the ball, and yes, we are willing to help," he says.
