The Vincennes and Rogers received some "negative" mail last July, shortly after the Iranian plane was shot down, a spokesman said."That's all there was to it.No Threats However, Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made against Rogers, the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship returned to San Diego.He also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that her family had received no threats since the airplane was downed."If she didn't get out like that . . . well, she was very, very lucky," one source said.Officials said Friday that a serious investigation of the call was never launched.He said that no special security precautions had been undertaken for Rogers, crew members and their families after the Vincennes returned to San Diego.That decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew.After the bombing Friday, an FBI spokesman said the Rogerses' van was usually driven by Sharon Rogers, but two highly placed law enforcement sources told The Times that Will Rogers drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident about an hour before the blast.He returned, drank coffee with his wife, and then Sharon Rogers, who usually drove the van, left in the vehicle, investigators said.The mail was critical of the Vincennes' handling of the incident but did not contain threats, the spokesman said."It could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb," he said, "or it could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was trying not to get hurt."Other Vehicles Undamaged Though the van was surrounded on three sides by other vehicles, none of them were damaged, witnesses said.No other description of the car was available, but witnesses said there were four people in it.When Sharon Rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the Iranian jetliner.However, a senior Defense Department official said that there was "no evidence" of a terrorist connection Friday, and some law enforcement officials described the bombing as "amateurish.""Why should the Vincennes crew be treated any different?" he said.However, two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed on the transmission under the van.He said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs apparently came from one or two explosive devices, and that the apparatus was connected under the van's transmission."And then it all went up," the official said."There were no threats, nothing," he said."I believe she got out just as it blew," said Kurt Lent, a laborer who was walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded.Police and Navy officials said Rogers and his wife telephoned their son, Bill Rogers, at an eastern university, where he is a student.Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30 a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop.He noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were planted on the vehicle or that only a small amount of high-intensity explosives were used.The official also said that the van had been parked in the driveway overnight, but that neither the Rogerses nor any neighbors reported prowlers near the vehicle.
