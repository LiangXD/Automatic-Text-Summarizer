The president, who leaves office July 28, said the newly formed People's Defense Revolutionary Movement, is the "urban, metropolitan organ of the Shining Path."Shining Path rebels have formed a new front to push their insurgency into Lima and other coastal urban areas, President Alan Garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded within blocks of the Government Palace.The raids also proved that the new urban front has been formed, Garcia said: "The people who were captured were essential to the new movement."Operating out of its stronghold in Ayacucho, the Shining Path has spread throughout Peru's highlands since it launched its armed insurgency in May 1980.
