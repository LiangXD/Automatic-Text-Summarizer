It looks to us as if Clarence Thomas is the first Justice to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court with a popular mandate.They can't possibly have wanted the sexual harassment charge against Clarence Thomas to go before the entire American population.We have argued continuously during these years that this argument was false, that the voters had indeed entrusted Ronald Reagan with a mandate (his campaign positions were clear) and that the losing side was trying to overturn the results of these elections.They have now given their consent in three successive presidential elections to a direction that can fairly be called conservative.As for Clarence Thomas, we don't agree that he joins the Court in a damaged state.Now, with Clarence Thomas heading for the Court and the voters going back to their daily lives, what has been learned?If there is a group of true political independents in this country, they are it.
