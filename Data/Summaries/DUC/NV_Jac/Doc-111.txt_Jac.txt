Elizabeth Taylor has rallied from a near-fatal bout with pneumonia _ and even joked about coming out in her "balcony attire" to wave to reporters _ but is "not out of the woods," doctors say.Miss Taylor has had back troubles since she fell off a horse during filming in 1945 of "National Velvet.""I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and I believe that has now passed," Dr. Bernard Weintraub, a lung specialist treating Miss Taylor at St. Johns Hospital and Health Center, said Wednesday.
