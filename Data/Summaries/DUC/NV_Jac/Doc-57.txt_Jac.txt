Mr Clinton promised yesterday his reforms would be based on the principle that 'welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life'.The president said he would focus on better implementation of the Family Support Act, a 1988 welfare reform based on the work of an NGA task-force which he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.
