This, in fact, may have been one reason why the load on the United flight was light.If preliminary reports that there was wind shear in the area are true, then "that would indicate there was some instability in the atmosphere," he added.Yesterday's marks the third crash of a United jet in the past three years.In Sunday's crash, the jetliner was a few miles from the airport and so should have been at a somewhat higher altitude.The jet involved in the crash is almost nine years old.Moments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23 miles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, Mr. Hall said.
