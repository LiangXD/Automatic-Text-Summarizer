United Nations Security Council; November 29, 1990; ...; War Pros; Here are the major justifications for war that have been advanced by Bush or his supporters:; Counter aggression:; Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait has posed the first crisis of the post-Cold War world.More likely to bog down the alliance is the static defense line the Iraqis have built up around Kuwait, which include concrete trenches; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; INTERNATIONAL FORCES IN THE GULF; Iraqi forces total 1,030,000.But even if war becomes necessary to force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, it would be better to wage it after the sanctions have weakened the Iraqi army and air force, depriving them of spare parts and supplies.; Oil:; Most of the oil output from Iraq and Kuwait could be saved through tougher fuel conservation measures.Some of Iraq's differences with Kuwait may be legitimate.; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; HOW THE WAR MIGHT UNFOLD; PHASE 1 (DAY ONE TO THREE) (includes small graphics); Objective: Destroy the country's air defense systems, air force installations and command centers through bombing raids, cutting off most of the Iraqi troops from Baghdad's central command.Bush orders U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia in response to fears of an Iraqi invasion of that country.; 9: U.N. Security Council declares Iraq's annexation of Kuwait null and void.If allowed to corner the world energy market, Saddam could threaten access to oil at reasonable prices.; Iraq's weaponry:; Iraq which has a stockpile of chemical weapons and is developing biological and nuclear weapons, could one day threaten the security of other oil-rich Arab countries and Israel if its arsenal is not destroyed now.; Military readiness:; U.S. forces, which will eventually total some 430,000, will not be able to maintain their readiness indefinitely.Also, much of the U.S. technology, including the Stealth, hasn't been fully battle-tested.; ...; PHASE 3 (DAY SEVEN TO 90); Objective: To liberate Kuwait by isolating it and overcoming the Iraqi troops there.; U.S.-led forces would use aircraft such as the A-10 Thunderbolt (Warthogs) and Apache helicopters to smash Iraqi tanks and undermine resistance to ground forces, both in Kuwait and Iraq.; Paratroopers would be dropped behind the Iraqi lines in Kuwait.; Marines would attempt another amphibious amphibious assault on the shore of Kuwait.; Alliance troops on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border would push across it, slowly smashing and pushing aside the fortifications the Iraqis have set up along the frontier.; The alliance forces Would attempt to engage the elite Republican guard forces, which number some 105,000, most of which are stationed near Basra.; Obstacles: The Iraqi troops are war-tested and have the home advantage: Protecting Iraq and what they believe to be an extension of their nation's territory.Handful of medical personnel sent have since returned.; Pakistan: Thirteen thousand troops sent.; ...; Mideast (includes map); Egypt: Has sent 29,250 ground troops.; Gulf Cooperation Council (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait): In all, GCO and other local Arab troops total 150,000.; Saudi Arabia: Has sent 55,000 soldiers and assorted air and ground weaponry.; Syria: Has sent 21,000 ground troops.; ...; Other countries; Australia: Two guided-missile frigates and a supply ship.; Canada: Two destroyers and a supply ship; Morocco: Has sent 1,700 ground troops.; Niger: Has sent 480 ground troops.; Senegal: Has sent 500 ground troops.; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; THE ECONOMY AND WAR; SHORT WAR SCENARIO; Foreign crude oil (includes graph on prices by quarter for 1990 and 1991); Key assumptions; A quick, positive solution to Kuwait crisis achieved this winter.; Oil prices drop below $20 by late spring.With Iraq's ground forces stunned, Turkish and Syrian troops amassed on the northern border would invade.; Obstacles: Though most Iraqi air defenses and forces could be eliminated, many of the country's enormous supply of air defense guns would be functional and deadly.
