Moreover, the quoted minimum wage for a state is often deceptive.California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages.Some states offer what is, in reality, a menu of minimum wages rather than a single minimum.Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05.Yet 41 states are still at or below the current federal level.Moreover, 13 states have minimums below the federal level and nine have no minimum at all.The advantage of allowing state or regional differences in minimum-wage levels is that the appropriate minimum wage for Connecticut might force massive layoffs in Texas.
