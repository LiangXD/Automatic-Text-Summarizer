Steger, who in the past has picked his own teams, says he is honored that the Soviet Union and China will be sending official representatives.These ominous changes are most apparent in Antarctica, making it "like a canary in a mine," Steger said.The team will be under the ozone hole for about 40 days and 500 miles as they cross a 13,000-foot high plateau known as the Area of Inaccessibility.Antarctica's 5.4 million square miles is more than China and India combined."We want the world to know much, much more about Antarctica after our expedition than it did before we set out," Steger said.The other environmental nightmare awakening interest in Antarctica is the discovery of a giant hole in the ozone layer directly over the continent.There's nothing to map," Steger said.Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snow tractors, but this will be the first unmechanized attempt.This one would do that and more: draw attention to threats against nature and to the need for international cooperation in protecting Antarctica.Scientists predict continued ozone depletion will increase skin cancer, but such thinking is "myopic," Steger said.The USSR also plans to send a military cargo plane to pick up the team from its rendezvous at Steger's Minnesota camp; the U.S. State Department, while not officially sanctioning the trek, is expected to let the plane land.The other members of the team are glaciologist Qin Dahe of China; Geoff Somers, who has spent 42 months in Antarctica with the British Antarctic Survey; and Keizo Funatsu of Japan, a former economist who turned to dog-sledding and adventure.
