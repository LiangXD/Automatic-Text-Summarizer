"I think it's utter stupidity," Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said."This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into doing what the federal government wants it to do," said Gates.Police actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said.But, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any nonviolent demonstrator is often "barbaric," and she supports restraints on the police.At demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: "L.A. blue, we're with you.""It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent," said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration.It's a pain control technique," he said.A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: "By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . .Sobel was "amused" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives.Meanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it.A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting.Trying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.Suddenly, some pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion Republicans are voicing the sort of "police state" rhetoric once associated with anti-war radicals.In fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta.In reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used "in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . . all through the '60s, all through the '70s," Gates said.This time, however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes from anti-abortion protesters with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives."The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground," Nichols said.Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police.Police departments nationwide say it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative protesters cooperate.In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along.Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and "go limp" when asked to move, others link arms.* NEW USE FOR OLD TOOL An ancient Asian farm tool has become a cutting edge weapon for many police officers in Southern California.* In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: "Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em.""Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take action against abortion," he said in a sworn statement last August, given as part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices.Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa.If you don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are possible."Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights."But if this "horrendous" new measure has its intended effect, eliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, his department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe take over any facility they choose, he said.Operation Rescue protesters stand out, he said.In demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and Denver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of "curbside justice."In fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force.As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.What they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights.""All I want my officers to think of at the time that they're taking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest."The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous.
