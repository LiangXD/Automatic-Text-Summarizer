A boom wasn't placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it wasn't available in Valdez, Exxon officials have said.Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances there will be no damage to the British Columbia coast if the tanker is towed to Oregon, and the mayor of Valdez said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude."The Exxon Valdez accident has taught us that simply having a plan is not sufficient," the Alaska Republican said.Iarossi also said Exxon has changed its policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited, four hours before sailing.Neil Goldschmidt said Tuesday there are "a lot of questions that need to be answered" before the Valdez is allowed in.Meanwhile, Exxon said placing an oil-catching boom around the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line.Early Tuesday, Exxon said it had finished transferring about 42 million gallons of crude to three other ships.Of about three dozen oil-soaked otters rescued following the spill, about one-third have died, Alaska Department of Fish and Game spokesman Jon Lyman said.
