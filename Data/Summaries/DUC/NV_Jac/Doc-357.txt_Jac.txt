For starters, there's likely to be new resistance in Israel, where some are already asking what this war would have been like with a pro-Iraqi Palestinian state next door.Then the U.S. would extract its ground forces from the region while relying on Gulf governments to craft a new security system that could be silently supported by Washington.The problem is exacerbated by the growing likelihood, acknowledged privately by Bush administration aides, that Saddam Hussein will survive in power for at least a while longer.President Hafez Assad's power clearly is enhanced by the defeat of his archrival next door, Saddam Hussein, and his new chumminess with Washington.The overall security and prestige of America's friends, of course, is sure to be enhanced by the crushing defeat allied forces have dealt to what was widely considered the Arab world's best army.So Mr. Assad is gambling that he will be able to use the Iraqi defeat to enhance his own strength in the region and secure his control over Lebanon while the U.S. and other Western countries keep silent in appreciation for his help in the Gulf.Similarly, Jordan's open sympathy for Iraq has deeply strained relations with the U.S., creating another impediment to solving the Palestinian problem.Here are some of the challenges and opportunities as they now appear on the eve of a clear military victory: The first order of business will be simply pacifying the stormy border between Iraq and Kuwait."At this point, making it very clear Saddam Hussein has been defeated and there are no illusions about it is good -- provided that we know how to play the next phase," said William Quandt, a former National Security Council Middle East analyst now with the Brookings Institution.Mr. Bush last night emphasized that the temporary cease-fire would be off the minute that Iraq fired any Scud missiles.Beyond that, officials of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and the five smaller Gulf Arab states, already have worked out plans for an Islamic peacekeeping force to guard Kuwait.Syrians don't love Saddam Hussein, but they aren't fond of the U.S., either.Although Mr. Bush took pains to note that "no one country can claim this victory as its own," the triumph will clearly leave the U.S., along with its friends in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as the dominant powers in the Middle East."We've been saying these are Arab matters for a specific reason," says one Bush administration official."If Saddam Hussein is weak enough, you'll see that kind of thing going on again," predicts Kenneth Katzman, a former U.S. intelligence analyst who now is a defense consultant.Tehran will insist on being a part of any new Persian Gulf security system, and may use its influence within it to agitate for expelling any Western forces from the region.Yet that problem may be harder to solve now, rather than easier.The Bush administration already is laying plans to make sure its gains aren't squandered after the war.
