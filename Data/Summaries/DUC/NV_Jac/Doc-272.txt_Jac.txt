In the current House it is 8%.In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won.The polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way they can control Congress effectively is by limiting terms.Democratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor had spirited competition in 1984 when he won with 57%; this year he has no opponent at all.Critics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not -- it's wrong to blame Congress for the now nearly 100% re-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for.Senators have become just as brazen as their House brethren in shutting out competition.
