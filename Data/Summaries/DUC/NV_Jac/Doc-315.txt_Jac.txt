But whatever the future of Drexel and its once-star junk bond chief, it is clear that Milken is an exceptional individual who was driven from the very beginning with unusual determination.Milken virtually single-handedly pioneered the modern junk bond market, now worth $180 billion in total bonds outstanding, and the fuel that has financed hundreds of small- and middle-size businesses and wave after wave of corporate takeovers.Milken viewed the issuance of junk bonds by small- and medium-size companies as part of a crusade to change the face of corporate America.By the time he was a high school student in the San Fernando Valley, it was clear that Michael Milken had a bright future.Soon, Milken found that trading junk bonds wasn't enough.Drexel and Milken defenders say such practices were necessary to maintain orderly markets in junk bonds where there were few buyers and sellers anyway.While Milken's junk bonds helped companies create thousands of new jobs, they also led to layoffs of workers at firms taken over by raiders financed by junk bonds.But despite the image of Milken as a devoted father and charitable giver, federal investigators and critics believe that he built his junk bond empire partly on deceit and manipulation.Junk bonds at the time were primarily debt issues that were once highly rated but had fallen in value and increased in risk when the issuing companies fell on hard times.He and Drexel began underwriting new junk bonds, issued by companies that were too small, young or risky to get conventional bank loans or issue conventional high-rated corporate bonds.To spur this crusade, Milken also created and unleashed a stable of corporate raiders whose hostile takeover bids were made possible by junk financing.Junk bond issuers often were asked to buy junk bonds issued by other corporations.By many estimates, Milken probably achieved that milestone, because by the age of 30 he was a fast-rising star at the fast-rising securities firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., managing its high-yield "junk bond" operations and reaping huge profits for the firm and himself.Milken is expected to be indicted separately on these charges soon, possibly this week."Capital is no longer a scarce resource," Milken told a group of high school students in a 1986 speech.Out West, Milken felt he could work long hours yet still be home in time for dinner with his family.And while Milken's family foundations donated millions of dollars of his profits to various charitable causes, he also is accused of questionable practices that netted exorbitant profits for himself and colleagues.The news Wednesday that Milken will be fired by Drexel and will not paid his 1988 bonus of $200 million as part of the company's settlement of securities fraud charges signals the end to the Milken era at Drexel.Milken's shrewd trading of junk bonds soon began making millions of dollars for Drexel -- and for himself and his band of hard-working traders and salesmen.Milken also is described by colleagues as a supportive, although somewhat harried, manager.Milken, friends say, also wanted to be close to his father, who was then dying of cancer."Mike's a builder; everything he's touched has been the better for it," colleague Horowitz said.And while his junk bond machine transformed Drexel from a second-rate securities firm into one of the most powerful on Wall Street, his alleged transgressions as its junk bond chief ultimately could be the firm's undoing.Managed Investments "He was very successful in everything he did, whether it was sports or school service or debate," recalled Harry Horowitz, a Milken friend since childhood who followed him to Drexel and now serves as a senior vice president there.He must have talked to 200 people a day, so he was a good source of information and ideas."Although takeovers account for only about a fourth of junk bonds issued, the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors charge, among other things, that Drexel's junk bond operations engaged in an array of securities violations, including market manipulation, inadequate disclosure, "parking" of securities to hide their true ownership and other infractions.
