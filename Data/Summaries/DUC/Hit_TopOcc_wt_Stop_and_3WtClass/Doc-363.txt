justice holmes would have spent much of his confirmation battle explaining how it was that he could hold such benighted views, and defending why he really wasn't prejudiced against the handicapped. judge bork defended himself well this week, with scholarly precision and often with humor, but in washington reasonableness alone is not enough to win a seat on the court. a group known as people for the american way papered washington with ads headlining the case of robert bork vs. the people, suggesting, apparently, that anyone who supports judge bork opposes the people, not to mention the american way. judge bork had to explain that, yes, there are all kinds of privacy rights in the constitution (the first, 4th and 5th amendments, for example), but he didn't believe there is any generalized, undefined right. so americans were left with the spectacle of this distinguished judge and scholar having to plead in public that he is not a bigot, that, indeed, he had once persuaded the senior partners in his chicago law firm to end their quota on jewish attorneys. judge bork's supporters in the white house believe that all of this helped his cause, that it proved he wasn't, as one put it, a neanderthal. if judge bork is not confirmed, however, the record of this week suggests that the reason will result less from his own failings than from the ferocity and distortions of his opponents.
