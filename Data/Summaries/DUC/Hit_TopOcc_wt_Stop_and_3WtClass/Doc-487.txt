today we gather at a new instrument... to explore the mysteries of our very own home planet, bass said, as the crew members, wearing futuristic black uniforms, fought to contain their emotions. i have had a vision that man could change from being a desert-maker into a builder of oases, crew member mark nelson said before stepping through the air lock. space biospheres ventures, developer of the private, for-profit project, expects to draw up to a million visitors annually and has applied for some 50 design patents. the crew members, ranging in age from 27 to 67, will raise their own food and recycle all air, water and wastes. the 45-minute closing ceremony after dawn today included prayers from a tibetan monk and a sun dance by dan old elk, a sioux from montana who presented each crew member with a braided sprig of sweet grass from canada. each crew member is likely to spend about four hours daily on farming and other chores to maintain the complicated machinery driving the biosphere. but margret augustine, president and chief executive officer of the project, said problems could crop up after a month or so that would require the crew to leave temporarily before returning for a solid two years.
