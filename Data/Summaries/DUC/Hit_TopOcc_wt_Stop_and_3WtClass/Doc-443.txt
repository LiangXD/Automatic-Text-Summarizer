crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s. flue-cured tobacco accounts for just over half of this, and while there is likely to be some modest growth in the value of its output this year, the rest, with the exceptions of beef and horticulture will fall catastrophically so much so that, in real terms, farm output in 1992 is projected to slump to its lowest levels for 30 years. following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the zimbabwean dollar, exports of farm produce in us dollar terms will be sharply lower, with tobacco earnings of less than usdollars 500m, compared with dollars 520m in 1991 (28 per cent of total exports). the collapse of sugar, cotton, and maize exports and reduced foreign earnings from coffee and tea will cost the country at least dollars 150m (10 per cent of exports) over the next 12 months. the traditional suppliers of maize to these countries - south africa and zimbabwe - will be importing up to 7m tonnes themselves this year (5m tonnes for south africa and 2m tonnes for zimbabwe). zimbabwe's authorities will have to grapple with the problems either of running the trains through to the main distribution centres, such as harare and bulawayo, or transferring the maize to the zimbabwe rail and road systems at the beit bridge border. at best, it will take the industry until 1994-95 to regain average production levels of the late 1980s, while the economy as a whole is unlikely to recover fully from the drought of 1992 for at least two years.
