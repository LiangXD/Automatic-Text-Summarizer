black americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today. the research found that when living conditions are identical, black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the tb bacteria. another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the tb bacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone to tuberculosis. stead's study found that blacks got infected more readily than whites, regardless of the race of the person who initially brought the infection into the nursing home. this phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks. stead speculated that whites have evolved better defenses against tb, because the bacteria has long been common in europe and parts of africa north of the sahara, but is traditionally rare in sub-saharan africa. others possible factors include homelessness and immigration of people from areas where the disease is still common.
