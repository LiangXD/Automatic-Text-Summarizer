for the tabloid press had been humming with rumors that liz taylor had aids virtually since she was checked into daniel freeman hospital in marina del rey april 9 with a high fever and sinus infection. liz is as close to american royalty as you can have, and our readers... in the heartland... they're living and dying with her, said barry levine, hollywood bureau chief of the star, which featured a cover photograph of liz, hooked up to an intravenous tube and oxygen mask, being transferred from the marina del rey hospital to st. john's. some press coverage has bent over backwards to tug at the bounds of credibility the national enquirer has liz communing with the ghosts of forbes and one-time husband richard burton. if liz's public is fascinated by her frailties, perhaps reassured somehow by the knowledge that even the gods are vulnerable, their interest is also piqued by the public face she puts on her relentless brushes with illness and addiction. the taylor wit shone through even wednesday's press conference, when doctors passed on the actress' desire to come out and wave at you, but she wasn't in her balcony attire. over the years she has endured about 20 major operations on her back, appendix, eyes and teeth when the asian flu threatened taylor's life, doctors made a hole in her throat so she could breathe. her addictions have even been linked to a criminal investigation by the los angeles county district attorney's office last week, prosecutors announced that no charges would be filed against taylor's doctors, who had been accused of over-prescribing dependence-forming drugs.
