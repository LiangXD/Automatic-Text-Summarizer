psychologists who studied the downing of an iranian civilian airliner in the persian gulf say the military needs to better understand stress and should spend more on psychological research and improve its crew training. the judgment of the navy cruiser crew that mistakenly shot down the iranian plane july 3 was clouded by misconceptions caused by stress, the psychologists said. "there is much knowledge about how decisions go wrong and how they can be improved that is not being put to use in military decision-making," dr. paul slovic, a psychology professor from the university of oregon, told a house panel thursday. dr. steven zornetzer, representing the navy's office of naval research, responded that the service does try to consider stress and is spending $12 million a year on basic research into psychological questions. a navy investigation attributed the incident to stress-related mistakes made by the crew of the aegis-class cruiser, one of the navy's most sophisticated warships. les aspin, d-wis., chairman of the panel, said, "misinterpretations of data provided by the aegis weapon system and chaotic communications in the command center have pointed up troubles with man's ability to make fast, accurate decisions in combat." dr. richard nisbett, a psychology professor at the university of michigan, noted that the vincennes crew was on alert for an attack by iranian planes.
