the focus of the drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most areas, the national weather service reported thursday. rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts along the u.s.-canadian border, possibly triggering scattered showers in the extreme northern plains and upper mississippi valley. in addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the northern great plains and rocky mountains. and a separate climate assessment added that many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months. the drought region now extends well into west virginia and includes nearly all of ohio and indiana and much of kentucky and tennessee, the weather service drought advisory said. the national picture shows the current drought to be about equivalent to that of 1911, and still somewhat less severe than in several years in the 1930s or 1956. in addition to thursday's short-range forecast, the medium-range outlook through july 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain hotter than normal, particularly the tennessee valley, lower midwest, central and northern great plains, northern rockies and great basin.
