as of wednesday, 12 days after the exxon valdez ran aground, the 240,000-barrel slick was estimated to affect an area the size of delaware, and exxon's fleet of oil-skimming boats had picked up only about 5% of the spilled oil. steve cowper said the coast guard should be better able to handle coordination and management of the cleanup than exxon, which he said was too bureaucratic. exxon spokesman henry beathard said the company disagreed with charges it was not handling the cleanup properly and thought exxon was the best organization to manage the effort. the 987-foot ship lifted off the reef three hours earlier than the exxon salvage crew predicted, proceeding without problem under close watch of a flotilla of six tugs and other support craft, including the coast guard cutter rush, to a cove on uninhabited naked island 25 miles to the southwest, where repairs will be made. almost 1 million barrels of oil were pumped from the exxon valdez to three smaller tankers over the last 11 days, and the salvage process began as soon as the last of the tankers left for southern california refineries on tuesday. the port of valdez was closed at 10 a.m. to clear the iceberg-dotted waters of other vessels as the refloating was attempted and coast guard spokesman bruce pimental said that the vital oil terminal would remain closed until the stricken tanker was safely anchored. exxon officials were reluctant to estimate how long temporary repairs would take or discuss where the tanker would be taken to permanently patch its hull and rebuild its internal pumping system, which also was compromised in the accident.
