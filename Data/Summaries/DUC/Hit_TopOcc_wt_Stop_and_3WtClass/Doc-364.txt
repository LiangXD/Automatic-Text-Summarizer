legal experts differed sharply in testimony before the senate judiciary committee over what impact judge robert bork's free-market approach to antitrust law would have on competition and consumers. but donald baker, a washington lawyer and former chief of the justice department's antitrust division, said in a statement that judge bork is in the mainstream of antitrust, which means his antitrust thinking.... is widely used by antitrust practitioners, antitrust courts and even antitrust professors. speaking to representatives of groups supporting the nomination, he portrayed judge bork's opponents as liberal special interest groups, asserted that judge bork would be tough on criminals, and said there has been a deliberate campaign of disinformation and distortion waged against the nominee. he said judge bork favors making legal practically all price and other restrictive agreements between manufacturers and distributors, and that his approach to mergers between competitors would make the reagan administration's lenient policy seem recklessly restrictive. mr. reagan maintained, as the white house has for months, that judge bork's philosophy is in the mainstream of contemporary thought. but the president also emphasized, in stronger terms than previously, his view that judge bork would be a law-and-order justice who would aid the fight against crime. judge bork has argued for more reasonable interpretations of criminal procedures that assure both justice and the prompt conviction of criminals, rather than allowing dangerous criminals to go free on unjustified technicalities, mr. reagan said.
