it is calling on the united states and other nations participating in the conference, which begins monday in chile, to designate antarctica as a world science park. bruce vento (d-minn.), chairman of the house interior subcommittee on parks and public land, said he fears that recurring degradation has made antarctica an environmental time bomb ready to explode. congressional legislation calling for preservation of antarctica is awaiting president bush's signature, but there has been speculation that the interior department might urge bush to veto the measure. the legislation for the first time would apply u.s. environmental protection laws to any activity in antarctica sponsored by an agency of the u.s. government. the united states should be leading the way and trying to protect the island instead of trying to protect the mineral convention, said rep. the focus of a dispute between congress and the state department is the ratification of the convention on the regulation of antarctic mineral resources activities, on which the state department has worked for six years. but tucker scully, director of the office of ocean affairs at the state department and the lead u.s. negotiator for antarctic issues, disagreed with the hands-off approach to the continent.
