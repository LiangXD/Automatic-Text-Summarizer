what we're doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at drexel), in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital, milken says, although he no longer trades or underwrites securities. in an off-the-record interview, the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of milken's at drexel and praises milken effusively said that he couldn't afford to have any formal business relationship with icag. but one clue to the amount of money that milken personally is committing to the firm is how much he says icag is willing to invest in an individual transaction. by helping companies, milken means suggesting ways that they could improve their basic business, working out creative means of raising capital or recapitalizing to reduce interest costs, and using his vast network of contacts to put companies in touch with potential investors. oscar u. mutz, president and chief executive of forum group, an indianapolis developer of retirement communities that is a drexel customer, says: i don't ask drexel's permission to go see morgan stanley (another wall street investment bank), and i don't ask drexel's permission to go see michael milken or anybody else. milken, who was one of the most feared competitors on wall street when he was at drexel, now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and underwriting business that he can no longer do himself. milken himself takes pains to downplay his former role as competitor, saying that as a former buyer and seller of securities, he always had to maintain good relationships with other firms.
