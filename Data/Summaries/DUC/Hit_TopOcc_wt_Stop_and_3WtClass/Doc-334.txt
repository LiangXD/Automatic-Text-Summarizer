during the 1988 campaign, bush conceded in interviews that he had to do some of the dirty work in attacking dukakis his alternating nice and nasty faces came to be known as george the gentle and george the ripper. in the many times over the past three years when sununu helped land the president in the political soup, the washington political cognoscenti speculated that bush was keeping his chief of staff only out of loyalty to sununu for helping him win the new hampshire primary, or because bush was too nice to fire anyone, or because he was too indecisive. while sununu's lack of political skill in dealing with political washington eventually cost him his job, and while his fatal flaw may have been in believing that he was smarter than bush, the chief of staff was -- often in an inept way -- trying to fulfill the mandate he had been given by his boss. in many critical ways, sununu exacerbated bush's limitations, rather than making up for them, and whenever the spotlight swung away from foreign affairs, it became painfully apparent that this was a white house without a long-range agenda, without a communications strategy and without first-rate thinkers in many top jobs. as bush tried to be the ultimate washington insider, the chief of staff alienated congress, cabinet members, house republicans and the press, who disdained sununu because they believed he misled them. when the glow faded from the persian gulf war, and the country began looking to the white house for leadership on the stagnant economy and the pain of many americans, the president once again allowed himself to be guided by sununu and his closest white house ally, richard darman, the budget chief. important republicans scorned by sununu began going on the record with their advice to bush that he was being ill served by his chief of staff.
