but when the shadow's narrow path does cross inhabited areas, people flock there to experience totality -- to watch the light snap off and the stars snap on, and to gaze at the sun's shaggy corona hanging in the dark sky for a few minutes before daylight abruptly returns. also, its 150-mile-wide path across hawaii, baja california, mexico city and four central american capital cities puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history, says alan dyer, an editor of astronomy magazine. it's going to be great from up there on the mountain, said harold zirin, a california institute of technology astronomer who will be at one of the observatories atop mauna kea, a dormant volcano that makes up a large piece of the island of hawaii. (the keck observatory, being built by the university of california and the california institute of technology, is behind its original construction schedule and will not be completed in time for the eclipse.) what they want to know is more about the temperature and composition of the sun's upper atmosphere -- layers called the chromosphere and the corona -- which normally is difficult to examine against the glare of the sun. they hope the information will provide clues to what causes the sun's 11-year cycle of sunspots and flares (now near its peak), what propels the solar wind and why the sun's outer atmosphere is, paradoxically, so much hotter than its lower atmosphere. solar wind studies at some observatories, astronomers will take repeated photographs of the corona during the eclipse to study it close up and to watch for material accelerating outward to become solar wind.
