if mr ernesto zedillo, mexico's next president, had any doubts about the difficulties of reforming mexico's governing party and the country's corrupt judicial and legal system, the assassination last week of mr jose francisco ruiz massieu, the party's number two official, will probably have removed them. mr ruiz massieu's killing was allegedly ordered by mr manuel munoz rocha, a federal deputy of the ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri), and mr abraham rubio canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to the gulf drug cartel in the state of tamaulipas. this alleged alliance between a hardliner in the governing party and a man with links to a drug gang has underlined concerns that efforts by mr zedillo to reform his party and the country's criminal justice system will be met with fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from these changes. since mr ruiz massieu's assassination, there has been renewed speculation that political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the killing six months ago of mr luis donaldo colosio, the ruling party's reform-minded presidential candidate, even though no evidence has emerged to indicate this is the case. two newspapers reported yesterday that mr munoz rocha has admitted to a role in the crime but put the responsibility on mr rubio canales, who reportedly blames mr ruiz massieu for his conviction for fraud in 1992, and the prison sentence he is currently serving. as if to underline this pledge, ms maria de los angeles moreno, the head of the pri group in the chamber of deputies and a reformist, was appointed to replace mr ruiz massieu as the party's secretary-general. mr ruiz massieu has taken charge of the investigation into his brother's death, and search for drug cartel members appears to have intensified.
