at the same time, however, the aids epidemic is being followed by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists said. "i think there is evidence that a substantial number of people who would have died are now alive," haseltine said at the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science. a number of treatments for aids and aids-related infections are available, he said, but many of them are not available to the poor or to developing countries. "there's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible," said john mcgowan of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases in bethesda, md. sten vermund, also of the allergy institute, noted that an epidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in aids patients in the inner cities. there is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have aids, but that is likely, vermund said. he said the rise in tuberculosis began before the aids epidemic, probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the 1970s.
