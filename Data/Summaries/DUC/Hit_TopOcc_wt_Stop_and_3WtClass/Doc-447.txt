they didn't know it had a habit of exploding with a force twice as great as the 1980 eruption of mount st. helens in washington -- or that the debris from these eruptions had covered much of what was now clark air base. (check) information is routinely analyzed by computer, allowing researchers to assess a situation quickly -- and to develop computer models for predicting the behavior of volcanoes. the 1980s was a very interesting decade because of the number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring information, said steven brantley, a geologist with the survey's cascades volcano observatory in vancouver, wash. it alerted the american public to volcano hazards and prompted a tenfold increase in government spending for volcano research and monitoring, said geologist robert tilling of usgs in menlo park. such a quick response is crucial because only a few dozen of the world's 500 active volcanoes have been adequately investigated and monitored. struggling to hear their instruments above the noise of nearby broadcast towers, he and his colleagues warned local officials that an eruption was on its way. tools give clues that can save lives the basic tools of volcano monitoring are cheaper and more portable than they were 10 years ago.
