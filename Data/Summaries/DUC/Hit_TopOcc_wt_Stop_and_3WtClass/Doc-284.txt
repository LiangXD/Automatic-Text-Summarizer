further study of a newly isolated hormone found in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the most common form of the disease, a scientist says. "we have a lot of evidence that this is likely to be, if not the final cause, at least a major part of the disease process," said new zealand biochemist garth cooper. the research "opens the door to the scientific study of the disease at a level that wasn't possible before and potentially the mechanisms that we uncover may be very wide ranging," he said. in his presentation, cooper said the hormone, dubbed "amylin," was normally undetectable but found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics. amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in type ii diabetes, he said. type ii diabetes afflicts the majority of the nation's estimated 11 million diabetics, according to the american diabetes association. scientists already knew of another pancreatic hormone that blocks insulin, but it is not found in abnormal levels in diabetics, said pi-sunyer, director of the endocrinology, diabetes and nutrition division at st. luke's-roosevelt hospital center in new york.
