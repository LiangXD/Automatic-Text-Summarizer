but the incident raises questions about sununu's judgment because it came only a few weeks after reports of his use of government jets for personal and political purposes. the latest flap has dominated white house briefings the past two days and prompted bush to suggest wednesday that sununu shouldn't use his government car for such purposes again. i recognize, and i think the governor (sununu) does, there's an appearance problem, said bush, who nonetheless defended sununu's use of the car as permissible in this case and said sununu's job was safe. white house spokesman marlin fitzwater, amplifying bush's comments, made it clear that bush had told sununu that he was concerned by the appearance of impropriety and that he wanted his chief of staff to take no more embarrassing trips. and some former white house officials say sununu should recognize that he is not serving bush well. in light of his problems with his jet travel and all that, he ought to be a little careful, said lyn nofziger, a white house political director under ronald reagan. as sununu himself has noted, some of the criticism goes with the job of saying no to administration officials and lawmakers who want the president's ear.
