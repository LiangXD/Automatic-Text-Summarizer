the eruptions at mount pinatubo finally gave harlow the chance to put his skills and experience to work saving lives. harlow and his team predicted the 1989 eruption of redoubt volcano in alaska, but few lives were threatened in the remote area. three weeks ago, harlow joined a team of five u.s. geological survey scientists who worked with 10 filipino scientists to try to forecast the eruption of the volcano, which had been dormant for about 600 years. harlow's team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption is imminent. since late tuesday, harlow's colleagues have not been able to get through on the single phone line into the bunker at clark air base, but do not believe the team is in danger. lord said harlow's love affair with volcanoes began when he was an undergraduate student at dartmouth college and his professor took the entire class to observe an eruption in guatemala. he's somebody who's fascinated by that kind of energy, said lord, a psychotherapist who has accompanied harlow to several volcanoes.
