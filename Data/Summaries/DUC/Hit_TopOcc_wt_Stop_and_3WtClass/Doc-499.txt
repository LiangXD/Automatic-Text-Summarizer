as a result, gen. powell, named the new national security adviser last week, appears to be the right man for the job at this stage of the reagan administration. secretary of state george shultz and frank carlucci, the current national security adviser and mr. reagan's nominee to become secretary of defense, are both better known in congress and will be more visible, selling the pending arms-control treaty and other administration policies. gen. powell, a genial and plain-spoken 50-year-old, is one of a special breed of washington figures: he is well known within the tightly knit national security establishment, yet largely unknown to the rest of the nation. when the reagan administration was planning its invasion of grenada, for example, gen. powell was serving as mr. weinberger's chief military assistant at the pentagon. gen. powell also has shown that he can present issues to his boss without seeming to impose his own views -- a skill useful in maintaining the image of honest broker of ideas important for a national security adviser. colleagues say it is extremely unlikely that mr. powell, both because of his own style and experience in the affair, would try to keep information from president reagan as adm. it isn't a term a grandiloquent national security adviser like henry kissinger would have used, but it's an indicator of the kind of efficient and noncontroversial nsc operation gen. powell can be expected to run.
