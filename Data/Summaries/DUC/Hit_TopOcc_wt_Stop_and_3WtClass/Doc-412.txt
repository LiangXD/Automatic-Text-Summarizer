someone set a fire early today in a storage room on the luxury liner regent star, five days after the ship ran aground in delaware bay because of another fire that cut off power, authorities said. no passengers were aboard and no injuries were reported in the 5 a.m. blaze, which was controlled within 90 minutes, said patrick mckee, a dispatcher for the city fire department. there were no immediate suspects and no immediate evidence to indicate that the fire was linked to the earlier fire, christmas said. the 20,000-ton liner was on its way from jamaica to philadelphia on sunday when a small fire prompted a power loss, allowing the ship to drift onto a sandbar. thursday, coast guard petty officer ken beatty said the ship passed all inspections and there was no serious damage from the grounding. the ship had been due to start on a two-day cruise later today, but that was canceled after the second fire broke out, authorities said. an hour after this morning's fire was controlled, about 300 crew members sat or stood in small groups alongside the port of history museum where the ship was tied up.
