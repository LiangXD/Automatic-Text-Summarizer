his time of 5.77 seconds was eclipsed by the 5.75-second time of daron council, a former narcotics officer who now works in crime prevention for the alachua county, fla., sheriff's department. he would merely have been a gold medalist if a positive test at the 1988 olympics had not turned him into the most vilified champion in the history of the games. there was a lot of pressure on me because it was my first race back, and it was hard to concentrate on the race with the way the fans were yelling for me. i'm in very good shape, but i'm not in racing shape, johnson said as he was escorted to drug testing, for which he was randomly selected. it was a different-looking johnson than the one who had bolted to apparent victory in the olympics. despite johnson's trimness, he said he weighed the same -- 174 pounds -- and was lifting the same amount of weight -- bench-pressing 365 pounds -- as before his two-year suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing steroid. when he was introduced before the race, johnson was given a thunderous standing ovation.
