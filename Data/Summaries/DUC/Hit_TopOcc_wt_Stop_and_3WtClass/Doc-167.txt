meanwhile, exxon said placing an oil-catching boom around the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line. iarossi also said exxon has changed its policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited, four hours before sailing. neil goldschmidt said tuesday there are "a lot of questions that need to be answered" before the valdez is allowed in. canadian authorities also asked exxon for assurances there will be no damage to the british columbia coast if the tanker is towed to oregon, and the mayor of valdez said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude. but after long island law enforcement authorities waited a second day for hazelwood to turn himself in, the suffolk county district attorney's office announced there would be no surrender that day. frank murkowski, a champion of oil exploration in alaska, asked that plans for drilling in bristol bay, the state's richest fishing grounds, be set aside until the industry can demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills. meanwhile, a multimillion-dollar class-action lawsuit was filed monday in federal court in california against exxon corp., charging that the spill has led to gas prices of 10 to 15 cents more a gallon for california drivers.
