lives like judge thomas's remind us of this simple truth. --- it was once thought that to choose a conservative black for a high appointment put liberals in an uncomfortable position, but we will learn in the thomas hearings that this is no longer so. this will be cloud cover for their real intention, which is to serve the interests of the interest groups -- the pro-abortion lobby, the civil rights lobby, labor -- that control their careers. those on the left are unmoved by mr. thomas's climb from nothing to something because he didn't do it the right way -- through them and with their programs. he has been helped all his life by affirmative action, but the kind liberals do not see and cannot accept: the uncoerced, unforced affirmative action that americans tend to take when someone at a disadvantage -- race, physical disability -- needs help. the nuns' affirmative action for clarence thomas was the only effective, meaningful kind: the kind we perform for individuals, not because it is state-mandated but because it is right, not because we love a race but because we care for people and love our country. what about those poor blacks not greatly gifted or guided -- what about them? --- for judge thomas's proponents, two great hopes: one is that the administration will hit america where it lives and go over the heads of the talking suits and straight to the people, presenting as witnesses on television the affirmative action crew that lifted a young boy with nothing to great heights -- the mother who was a maid, the grandmother who saved up the tuition and the nuns who helped open his eyes. mr. thomas's appointment is not a traducing of the people's will but a fulfillment of their directive. --- miss noonan is a writer in new york.
