the second amendment, in its language and its history, makes plain that the need for a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition for the right to keep and bear arms. mr. goldwin makes this mistake, in turn, because he has misread madison's original version of the second amendment, which exempted conscientious objectors from military service. roger pilon senior fellow and director center for constitutional studies cato institute washington --- the militia is not the national guard but rather the people of the original states. the addition in the early drafts of a conscientious-objector clause was added for the preservation of religious freedoms, which the colonists had not had in england. in my personal celebration of this 200-year-old document, i have pledged the following: i will give up my freedom of speech when they cut out my tongue i will give up my right to worship when they have slain my god and myself i will assemble with the people of my choice even when they are imprisoned, and i will give up my rifle when they pry my cold dead fingers from around it. updating the right to bear arms from 1791 to 1991, when i report for service i'll bring, as required, a few items consistent with the current infantryman's inventory: a barett light.50 semiautomatic sniper rifle, so i can reach out and touch people half a mile away a squad automatic weapon firing 5.56mm rounds at the rate of a whole lot per second out of 30-round clips or hundred-round belts a 40mm grenade launcher... but you get the idea. then, as a thoroughly modern, well-regulated militiaman, i'll take my weapons home, just as did morgan's riflemen, and the musket bearers of lexington and concord, and the colonial light artillerists.
