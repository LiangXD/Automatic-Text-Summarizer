a time magazine/cable news network poll reports that 87% of gun owners themselves favor a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases three-quarters favor registration of semi-automatic weapons and handguns, and half favor registration of rifles and shotguns. unfortunately, there is the second amendment to the constitution: a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. but why leap to the conclusion that a broadly worded constitutional freedom ( the right of the people to keep and bear arms ) is narrowly limited by its stated purpose, unless you're trying to explain it away? a colleague says that if liberals interpreted the second amendment the way they interpret the rest of the bill of rights, there would be law professors arguing that gun ownership is mandatory. kates expends most energy demonstrating that at the time of the bill of rights, all able-bodied men were considered to be part of the militia and were expected to defend the state if necessary. kates also marshals impressive historical evidence that the second amendment, like other bill of rights protections, was intended to incorporate english common law rights of the time, which pretty clearly included the right to keep a gun in your home for reasons having nothing to do with the militia. but in what i suspect was the main purpose of his exercise -- establishing that a flat ban on handguns would be hard to justify under the constitution -- kates builds a distressingly good case.
