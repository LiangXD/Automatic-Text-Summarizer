the bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients. anthony beilenson, who said plainly, the truth is, for welfare reform to be successful, it's got to be expensive. they point out that part of the money will go for special education, training and work programs for welfare mothers, to induce them off the rolls and into jobs. the bulk of the new money would go to higher afdc pay-outs, extension of mandatory benefits to two-parent families and maintenance of certain benefits for welfare recipients earning some income. together, spending for the seven major welfare programs (those just mentioned plus the women, infants and children program and the low income energy assistance program) has actually increased since 1970 by 232% in constant dollars, to an annual total $65.7 billion. the house democrats' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious. it is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the family welfare reform act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency.
