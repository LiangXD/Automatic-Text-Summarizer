in addition to air fare and hotel, runners are guaranteed spots in restricted entry races such as the london marathon. most marathons take you through cities, so you get a chance to see things you'd never see on a sightseeing bus, said fred lebow, president of the new york roadrunner's club and director of the new york marathon. lebow has run in 32 marathons, including london, paris, rome, stockholm, iceland, seoul and vienna. the cities are different, but most marathons include a carbo-loading pasta party the night before, medical exams, a post-race celebration, commemorative t-shirts and awards to finishers. england has similar organizations: sports tours international and keith prowse, a company that specializes in british theater, sports and concert tours. running 26 miles just to see a city definitely isn't for everyone, but at the very least, it's a way to kill two birds with one stone. if you're interested if you're interested in combining a vacation and marathon, here are some firms to contact: (box) marathon tours, 108 main st., charlestown, mass.
