an unqualified mate was piloting the exxon valdez -- violating both coast guard regulations and company policy -- when the tanker crashed into rocks, unleashing the worst oil spill in u.s. history, exxon shipping co. said sunday. cousins, a three-year employee of exxon, did not have the coast guard certification required to pilot through the sound but was qualified under other circumstances to steer the ship, iarossi said. a monitor from the u.s. fish and wildlife service said he felt encouraged about impact on the area's abundant marine life after patrolling the 50-square-mile slick by boat saturday. the reason we haven't seen a large number of birds affected so far is that the oil is out in the middle of the sound, said everett robinson-wilson, the agency's environmental contaminant coordinator. neither exxon nor the state and federal agencies involved in the operation could say how much oil had been mopped up or what percentage of the slick is contained. hasn't seen plan we have been told by exxon that they will come up with an organized cleanup plan, but we've yet to see one, said barbara holian, spokeswoman for the state department of environmental conservation. the agency is studying its legal options and may ask the coast guard to take over the cleanup from exxon, she said.
