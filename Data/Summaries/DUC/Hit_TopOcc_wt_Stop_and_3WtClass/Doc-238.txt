arthur andersen &amp company yesterday released a survey, by its tax and business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives of medium-sized companies in canada, mexico and the us strongly support nafta. meanwhile in mexico the country's congress launched a fierce attack on mr perot and other critics of its political system yesterday, in a furious response to mr perot's comments in the debate. the mexican congress issued a statement, supported by most political parties, which said: 'we cannot ignore however, that certain judgments expressed, apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country, attack and offend mexicans. us opponents of nafta believe that fear of job and investment losses to mexico will outweigh any new-found enthusiasm for the pact. 'the political equation still is going to be that congressmen who vote for nafta will have to look for other employment next year.' trying to blunt any momentum for the administration, congressman david bonior, an anti-nafta whip, on wednesday announced that he had 219 of 434 members pledged to vote against the pact. the anti-nafta citizens' trade campaign is bringing 'nafta claus' to the capitol to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell nafta to a reluctant congress.
