in washington, intelligence specialists said they believe that the jetliner may have been bombed by people seeking to retaliate against france for its recent actions in lebanon. ever since, one intelligence official said wednesday, the french government has realized that its planes were being targeted for some sort of terrorist attack. on wednesday, michel friess, a spokesman for uta, said that the wide surface over which the debris of the airplane has been found suggests a high-altitude explosion that leads one to think of a criminal attack. in santa monica, a rand corp. analyst, bruce hoffman, said wednesday he believed the attack was probably staged by shiite muslim groups concerned that france might intervene in lebanon on behalf of the maronite christians led by aoun. it could be that the maronites' opponents in general were determined to deliver some sort of a knockout blow in lebanon, and (it) was designed as a warning to make the french think twice. according to one well-informed intelligence official, both french and american officials took that threat seriously and searched all the luggage on the plane before allowing it to depart. while france's willingness to bargain with terrorists for the freedom of hostages had in the past created a modus vivendi that appeared to spare the country from violent attacks, hoffman and other analysts suggested that the stakes in lebanon had become too important for those old rules to apply.
