francis, the canadian national sprint coach, knew the polysyllabic names and complex characteristics of steroids -- furazabol, stanozolol, dianabol -- as if they were members of his family. and although he spoke of his athletes as if they were family members, too, he made it plain, under oath, that he had given them every steroid combination imaginable, his experiments all carefully calibrated, charted and analyzed. and because of that testimony, we have speed trap, an elaboration of what francis said at the inquiry and a history of his remarkable path through the world of track and field. he argues, essentially, that to be a world-class sprinter, you must use steroids -- he makes this argument even as johnson attempts a comeback for the 1992 olympic games in barcelona, spain, without them. by encouraging his athletes to use steroids -- and francis maintains that they all wanted to do so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up -- francis argues that he is simply helping to create a level playing field. at the end of speed trap, francis says that steroids cannot be simply banned -- their use is too prevalent, they can be disguised too easily and they work too well. it is a formidable challenge to distinguish between nature and artifice, a task i would leave to the philosophers.
