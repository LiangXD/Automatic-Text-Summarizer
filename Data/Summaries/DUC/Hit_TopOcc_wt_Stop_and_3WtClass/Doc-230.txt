only weeks before the mine came into production in july 1992 at a cost of usdollars 400m, de beers' central selling organisation, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from angola. this year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so that the cso is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to take from producers. about 70 per cent of venetia's diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at dollars 100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about dollars 500m. the mine has also revitalised de beers' production, as it is accounting for half the group's output in south africa and replacing production from its 100-year-old kimberley mines, which are now fading away. venetia's success is strategically important to de beers because, when its output is added to that in botswana and namibia, it gives the group direct control over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output. and, while venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes of waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected 23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour relations and environmental issues, at least as far as south africa is concerned. venetia is also breaking with the de beers' tradition that, for security reasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security area once it is no longer useful.
