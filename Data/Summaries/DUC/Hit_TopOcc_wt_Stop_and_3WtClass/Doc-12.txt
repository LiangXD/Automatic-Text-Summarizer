damage caused by hurricane andrew could rise to dollars 20bn, it was estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest us storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of new orleans. the hurricane tore through southern florida early on monday morning, causing billions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterday was moving north-west across the gulf of mexico with winds of about 140 miles an hour. ms kate hale, director of emergency services in florida's dade county, which bore the brunt of the storm, estimated that andrew had already caused dollars 15bn to dollars 20bn (pounds 7.5bn-pounds 10bn) of damage. new orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable because the city lies below sea level, has the mississippi river running through its centre and a large lake immediately to the north. the brunt of insurance claims from the florida storm will fall on the us industry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the state farm group and the allstate insurance unit of sears roebuck. according to balcombe group, a uk-based claims adjustment firm, other insurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are hartford insurance, aetna and travellers. the last serious us hurricane, hugo, which struck south carolina in 1989, cost the industry dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of the total damage caused ranged between dollars 6bn and dollars 10bn.
