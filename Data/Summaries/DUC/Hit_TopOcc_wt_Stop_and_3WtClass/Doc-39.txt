also on e-day, july 11, crowded cruise ships will linger off mexico's pacific coast, and thousands of u.s. tourists will drive south into baja california, which, usually boasting clear skies, is being billed as the world's most promising site from which to view nature's own light show. eclipse fans from japan to new york to the netherlands are expected in droves, but californians -- because of their proximity to baja and propensity for mystical phenomena -- should be conspicuous. however, the chic hot spot for eclipse watchers won't be mexico, but the big island of hawaii, where the 18,000 tourists who would be there anyway to enjoy the sunshine will be joined by an additional 30,000 or more coming to watch the sun go out for four minutes. but mexico will host the biggest share of travelers, partly because of its easy access from the united states and partly since the eclipse will last longest here: up to seven minutes, which is three more minutes than the maximum length in hawaii. we're worried that californians will drive down on the spur of the moment, without taking water or fuel, said marivi lerdo, who promotes tourism to mexico in new york. at six observatories atop hawaii's mauna kea, a dormant volcano that is the highest peak in the pacific, solar researchers will turn their telescopes on the sun's outer atmosphere as the moon covers the rest of the star. staring at the sun during a partial eclipse could quickly -- without your feeling a thing -- burn into your retina a permanent image of the crescent sun, causing severe and permanent vision loss.
