"this situation, i think, was everyone's secret nightmare about what could happen with oil traffic in the sound," said dennis kelso, commissioner of the alaska department of environmental conservation. efforts to begin pumping 200,000 gallons of oil off the exxon valdez onto another tanker, the exxon baton rouge, were halted early saturday when authorities noticed that oil appeared to leaking as the pumping operation proceeded. he also said four members of the coast guard's pacific strike team from san francisco, specially trained to deal with pollution and oil spills, arrived saturday and were helping to rig pumps and assemble equipment needed to transfer oil to the baton rouge. the spill's effect on wildlife had not yet been assessed, but commercial fishermen who depend on the sound for a catch worth millions of dollars were outraged and said a key herring spawning area had been polluted. "there's a high concentration of sea otter, waterfowl, sea birds and pink salmon in that area," said steve goldstein, a spokesman for the interior department in washington. "we feel that this should have been the easiest oil spill in the world to clean up," said riki ott, chairman of the organization's habitat committee. the largest tanker spill in history resulted from the july 19, 1979, collision off tobago of the supertankers atlantic empress and aegean captain, in which 300,000 tons _ more than 80 million gallons _ of oil was lost.
