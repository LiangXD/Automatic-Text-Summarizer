they're going to begin dying like bloody flies, said ed rist, head of care's east africa unit. even as africa slips into what could become the worst human disaster in its history, there is debate about whether the united states should aggressively intervene or offer assistance with political conditions attached. other famines there, most recently in the mid- and late 1980s, focused the attention of westerners with the media's shocking images of the crisis, including skeletal children suckling at their mothers' dry breasts. by the time we see the kind of pictures that would motivate people to act, it will be too late, said peter laugharn, coordinator for save the children's horn of africa program. because of internal government opposition, civil war and an undeveloped infrastructure, delivering food supplies and obtaining accurate numbers are difficult and sometimes impossible, they say. just as the need is exploding, however, resources of relief programs such as care are decreasing, according to reports from the general accounting office and the committee on refugees. although officials at the agency for international development won't confirm it, relief workers say the agency diverted a shipment of food from mozambique until the country promised the food would be delivered to its hungry population instead of to the army.
