while little can be done to control the natural fires that occur in chaparral country, homeowners can change their approach to landscaping and help improve the chances of their homes and property surviving a brush fire. the idea behind fire-resistant landscaping -- firescaping -- is to design landscaping to minimize the fire hazard, says owen dell, a santa barbara landscape contractor who has many canyon and hillside homeowners as clients. dell, the santa barbara city fire department, the city government and a number of volunteers combined their efforts and began planning the santa barbara firescapes demonstration garden to educate the public about reducing the risks of wildfire near their homes. the concept behind the garden is that while no plant is fireproof, some are more flammable than others. zone 4, farthest from the house, consists of native vegetation that has been thinned to reduce the amount of fuel that could feed a fire. cactus, tobira and shiny leaf jasmine are examples of fire-resistant plants that still have a high aesthetic appeal. just as appropriate landscaping can help gardeners with water shortages, so may careful landscaping help reduce the risk of significant property damage in the most fire-prone areas.
