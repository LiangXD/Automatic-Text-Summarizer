america's senior military officer tuesday endorsed the east bloc's move toward a more defensive military posture and reassured his warsaw pact counterparts that the united states and its nato allies will not launch an offensive military operation against eastern europe. despite the encouraging signs, the west's key concern remains the specter of confronting greatly superior forces armed, trained and suited for offensive ground operations, powell said in prepared remarks at a vienna session of defense chiefs representing 35 nations from both the east and the west. powell's remarks appeared to be directed primarily at the chiefs of eastern europe's military organizations, whose future roles in the warsaw pact are uncertain as a result of the the major domestic upheavals that have swept their nations. u.s. military intelligence officials have complained that while the soviets say they are reshaping their forces for defensive operations, they continue to deploy large supplies of spare weapons parts and huge ammunition caches near the east-west border, where they could be used by troops in an offensive operation. powell delivered his remarks on the first day of an unprecedented military doctrine seminar organized by a 35-nation forum that negotiates limitations on the military operations and practices of its member countries, most of which are european nations. saying the seminar's task is to help shape a new order in europe, powell defended u.s. military initiatives that have introduced to europe new, long-range weapons designed to attack soviet forces sent in to reinforce the first wave of a warsaw pact attack on western europe. this nato commitment to preserve territorial integrity at every potential point of attack... explains the nato strategy of bringing force to bear on successive echelons of attacking forces, powell said, noting that nato would be overwhelmed quickly if it had to face the full brunt of the warsaw pact's tank armies.
