dickey, who was testifying under subpoena, admitted under questioning that the black man, don jackson, never used profanity during the arrest as dickey had indicated in his report. boatwright questioned whether the car in which jackson was riding was actually weaving -- the stated cause for the traffic stop -- and whether jackson acted aggressively toward the officers, as dickey said in his report. earlier, under questioning by boatwright and as the videotape was played, dickey testified that the alleged infraction for which the jackson car was stopped -- crossing the center divider -- occurred before it could be seen on a tape shot from the nbc chase vehicle, but he maintained that the tape does show jackson's car weaving slowly within the traffic lane. boatwright, standing in front of the television monitor, pointed out that a videotape shot from the jackson car's rear window shows the street lights passing by in a consistent pattern -- indicating the car was not weaving. jackson, also testifying under subpoena, said that he and jeff hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer who drove the car, took great care not to break traffic laws when they cruised along pacific coast highway in long beach. he alleged that in addition to pushing his face into the glass, dickey hurt him by bending his fingers while handcuffing him and pushed his face into the hood of the police car. at one point in the proceeding, boatwright had dickey and jackson weighed in an attempt to show that jackson is shorter and weighs less than the officer.
