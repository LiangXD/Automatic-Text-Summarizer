even before biden rapped the opening gavel, thomas' nomination triggered a confirmation battle more akin to a political campaign -- television commercials, endorsements by dozens of groups for and against, and a daily drumbeat of support from president bush. biden said he would be looking closely to see whether thomas' philosophy would lead to imposition of a moral code on the constitution and radical change in legal opinion. thurmond, of south carolina, said thomas has all it takes to become an outstanding member of the supreme court. it is not appropriate that philosophy alone should bar a nominee from the supreme court unless that nominee holds a belief that is contrary to the fundamental, longstanding principles of our nation, thurmond said in prepared comments. white house spokesman judy smith said today that, although the white house would not divulge numbers in an informal head count, we're confident judge thomas will be confirmed. the committee is expected to closely examine thomas' record as chairman of the federal equal employment opportunity commission and as head of the education department's civil rights office. feminist groups have been in the forefront of the liberal coalition opposing thomas, warning that his vote added to an already conservative supreme court could overturn federal protection for abortion rights and send the issue back to state legislatures.
