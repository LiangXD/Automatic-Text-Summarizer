in a voluminous report issued yesterday, the national transportation safety board said these and other incidents carry a clear warning: many foreign-flag cruise ships that sail from u.s. ports have serious safety problems and the potential for a catastrophic accident is significant. the board, in sweeping recommendations, is seeking both legislation and voluntary cooperation from the industry to improve cruise-ship safety, which it says is marred by the less-than-exacting rules governing foreign-flag carriers. foreign-registered vessels make up the vast majority of cruise ships sailing from u.s. ports and catering to americans. ships operating from u.s. ports carried about five million passengers last year, and in anticipation of continued growth, 20 cruise ships are under construction around the world. but the overriding concern, the board said, is that foreign cruise ships are subject to rules that are less stringent and vigorously enforced than those imposed on u.s. flag vessels. but almost all cruise ships operating out of the continental u.s. sail under foreign flags, and the u.s. coast guard conducts only cursory inspections of foreign vessels. to reduce the chances of a cruise-ship disaster, the safety board is pushing for legislation that would give the u.s. coast guard the authority to enforce u.s. safety rules on foreign-flag vessels.
