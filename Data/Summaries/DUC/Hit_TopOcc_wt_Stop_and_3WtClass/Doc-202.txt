a colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the english channel from the white cliffs of dover, pursuing a dream born in napoleon's time that is coming true at last. it will enable freight to travel on one train instead of being shifted to trucks for a cross-channel ferry trip subject to weather and shipping strikes. britain's entry into the european economic community engendered a spirit of unity and the digging began again in 1974, but two years later a new british government shelved the project. with trade barriers among the 12 eec countries set to fall in 1992, colin kirkland, technical director of eurotunnel's on the british side, says the tunnel will be completed this time. eurotunnel ordered a management shakeup and threatened trans-manche link, the consortium of 10 british and french engineering companies building the tunnel, with penalties of $25 million if the diggers did not pass the three-mile mark by nov. with a laser beam to keep the driver on course, the 700-foot-long behemoth creeps along, pressing curved slabs of scottish granite and pulverized ash into the newly exposed tunnel wall. eurotunnel will run shuttle trains once every three minutes at peak times between terminals near folkestone and calais, and british rail and the frenh state railroad will operate trains from london and paris.
