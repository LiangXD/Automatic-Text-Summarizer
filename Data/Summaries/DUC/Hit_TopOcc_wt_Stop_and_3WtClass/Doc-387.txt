it's a polygraph test, an examination by that simple machine that supposedly detects the lies of those who submit to its cold wires and straps. critics, including psychologists, labor unions and many judges, say the polygraph is nothing but a crude interrogation tool with as much credibility as a mood ring. wouldn't it be nice if you had a simple test to prove deception? said david lykken, professor of psychology at the university of minnesota and a nationally known polygraph expert. candidly, there's a lot of art that goes into it, said paul minor, former fbi chief of polygraphs, who tested john delorean and anita hill. the highly trained examiner is relying on their skill as an interrogator, said oakland labor lawyer brad seligman, who successfully opposed pre-employment polygraph tests in 1989 at an electronics store chain. pathological liars studies also have been done by polygraphers to prove that pathological liars and psychopaths have no advantage because both types know they're lying and neither wants to get caught, said david raskin, a polygraph examiner and university of utah psychologist. there isn't any single study that resolves the controversy when one wants to know the accuracy of the polygraph in the real world, said frank horvath, president of the american polygraph association and professor of criminology at michigan state university at east lansing.
