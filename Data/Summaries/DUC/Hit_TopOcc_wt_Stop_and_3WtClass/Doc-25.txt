police had arrested flores on suspicion of assaulting an officer and of resisting arrest but the district attorney's office decided two weeks later to prosecute flores on the five misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest. but the district attorney's office declined to file any charges because the police report failed to show that gonzalez was involved in the altercation, brodie said. officer robert camarillo said in a police report that cornett was arrested in the 3600 block of taffrail road on suspicion of brandishing a weapon, resisting arrest and possessing a loaded firearm. 14, 1989, the police department and officers jana younger, fred sedillos and james struck, guzman-flores contends that he was grabbed from behind by younger while in the alley. the officer poked him with a baton and questioned him about a car parked nearby, guzman-flores said in the suit. but flores' lawyer, sherrie l. mccracken, said the report states that officers were at the shop responding to a complaint of a man with a gun. mccracken said the officers continued to question flores in english, but flores -- a recent immigrant from mexico who speaks only spanish -- could not respond.
