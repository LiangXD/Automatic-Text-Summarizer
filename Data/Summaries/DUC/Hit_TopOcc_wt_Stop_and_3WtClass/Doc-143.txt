on one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries. on the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as bank of boston decided monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible. it's a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out, says lawrence cohn, an analyst at merrill lynch &amp co. the bank of boston decision may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks, adds james j. mcdermott, jr., director of research at keefe bruyette &amp woods inc., a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks. now that bank of boston has reserved and written off most of its loans to less-developed countries, it's likely to be much less willing to join any such new efforts. moreover, most of the nation's big banks couldn't afford to follow bank of boston's lead without crippling their capital, and reducing their common equity-asset ratios to unacceptably low levels. in order to take steps similar to bank of boston's, large money-center banks would have to sell assets, shrink balance sheets and slash dividends -- and they show little sign of doing that. bank of boston announced monday that it was writing off $200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the third world on a non-accrual basis.
