the deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry, followed 10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown hotel, touched off an outcry by minority leaders for an outside review of the department. the city's police chief, john laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society. since former vice president hubert h. humphrey, then a 35-year-old mayor running for the u.s. senate electrified the 1948 democratic national convention with his historic speech in support of civil rights, minneapolis has been viewed as a liberal, progressive city. in a series of rallies in recent weeks, protesters demanded that officers involved in the drug raid be suspended, charges against those arrested at the hotel be dropped, and that a citizen police review board be established. gleason glover, president of the minneapolis urban league, which works for interracial cooperation, said police racism has been a problem since he took over the league position 21 years ago. "the matter of police misconduct and brutality has been going on for at least the 21 years i've been here, but i think the deaths pushed the issue beyond the point of tolerance that usually is the case in matters of police misconduct," glover said. laux said the 750-member department, which includes 62 minority members and 68 white women, will begin cultural awareness training for all officers, probably this fall.
