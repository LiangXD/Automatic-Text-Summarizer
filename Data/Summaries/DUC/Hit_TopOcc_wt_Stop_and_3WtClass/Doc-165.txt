the tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, exxon shipping co. said sunday. exxon shipping spokesman brian dunphy told the associated press that the captain of the tanker exxon valdez, joseph hazelwood, was not on the bridge at the time of the accident and that third mate gregory cousins was in command. more than four miles of floating boom had been placed in an effort to contain the oil, the coast guard said sunday. however, exxon insisted that the area was only 10 to 12 square miles, and coast guard officials said they were at a loss to explain the difference in estimates. the coast guard said about 84,000 gallons of oil an hour was being transferred at that rate, the unloading could take seven days. by late sunday, exxon officials said a total of 37,500 barrels of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation, leaving more than 900,000 barrels on the ship. an experiment to assess the possibility of burning off the oil was completed early sunday and the coast guard said exxon officials were "cautiously optimistic."
