the accidental shooting death of a young stockbroker by an officer looking for a burglar is one more strike against a police force already struggling with allegations of brutality and racism. police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong. it was the seventh shooting death involving kansas city police officers this year. two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said. barnes made "a kind of lunging motion," and the officer fired from about 5 to 8 feet, mills said. police chief steven bishop said before the latest slaying that the department's standing has fallen in the community, and a "behavior modification" program is being developed for offending officers. in another case, three undercover officers were suspended for a shooting this spring that left a young black man crippled.
