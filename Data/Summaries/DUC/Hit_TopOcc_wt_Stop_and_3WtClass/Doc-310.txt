in an episode of high drama, judge clarence thomas, who was only hours away from winning a lifetime seat on the supreme court, and anita hill, who says he made her a victim of sexual harassment, begin to tell their versions of the story this morning before the senate judiciary committee and an audience of millions. </lp> <text> the proceedings will be carried live on abc, nbc, cbs, cnn, public television and cable outlets. judge thomas also has to convince the lawmakers -- and the public, watching at home or offices -- that he did nothing to give the appearance that he was harassing her on sexual matters or was using his position as her boss to create an atmosphere of discomfort. if you listen to her carefully, no one can believe that woman is attempting to smear this man, says roger wilkins, a thomas opponent and former johnson administration official who now teaches at virginia's george mason university. the witnesses judge thomas has summoned on his behalf will seek to pick her story apart, citing telephone log comments indicating that ms. hill just called to say hello or needs your advice on getting research grants or wanted to congratulate on marriage. ms. hill will need to convincingly explain or refute those messages, as well as reports that have judge thomas, for example, helping her land a job on the law faculty at oral roberts university. mr. biden has told associates that he regards this episode as a terribly ugly chapter on capitol hill, and will seek in the televised hearings that begin this morning to reclaim the high ground for congress. but the groups could also lose by winning: they know that if judge thomas performs poorly today and is defeated, it is unlikely the president will nominate another black jurist. --- jeffrey h. birnbaum contributed to this article.
