less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed colombia to the brink of political chaos. "the gravest aspect of colombia's bloodletting is that the government has no idea how to even slow it," said a member of a regional human rights committee based in medellin, the cocaine capital. but the medellin cartel denied involvement, and no government official has yet said who was responsible for pizarro's assassination. traffickers have carried out a terrorist campaign that has killed nearly 300 colombians in the past nine months in an effort to halt the government's campaign to capture and extradite drug barons to the united states. former president alfonso lopez said the assassinations of three candidates indicated that colombia's armed forces must be reorganized. official investigations have shown that certain members of the armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the country's right-wing death squads. one of the country's presidential candidates, alvaro gomez, said friday that barco should name a three-man council to run colombia's security forces to avoid a military coup.
