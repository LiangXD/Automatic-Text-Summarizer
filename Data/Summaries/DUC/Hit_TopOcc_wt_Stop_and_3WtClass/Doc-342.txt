with the demise of the soviet union, the end of the cold war and worsening economic problems, former east bloc countries are slashing antarctic research budgets. but the national science foundation, which runs u.s. bases, thinks that the government's commitment to antarctica will wane, what with new restrictions on mineral development and declining soviet competition. such environmentalists as jacques cousteau campaigned for the antarctic minerals ban so antarctica could be used as an environmental laboratory to study the ozone layer, global warming and pollution. nations realized they needed a base to qualify for membership in the treaty system that governs antarctica, which was up for renegotiation this year. instead, in october, the antarctic treaty nations approved a substitute that bars mineral and oil exploration for at least 50 years and requires environmental safeguards for research bases. of the $193 million the u.s. plans to spend this fiscal year in antarctica, only $22 million is budgeted for science. they bring families to live in antarctica, not just scientists, encourage women to give birth at their bases and postmark letters there -- all to back claims of sovereignty.
