richard lacey, a microbiology professor at leeds university and the leading critic of government policy on bse, said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance. the advisers, led by the government's chief medical officer kenneth calman and chief veterinary officer keith meldrum, put out a detailed statement to justify their view that last month's death of 65-year-old duncan templeman - following that of peter warhurst, 61, a year ago - showed 'no features that give cause for undue concern'. robert will of edinburgh's western general hospital, who has been monitoring cjd in the uk since 1990 on behalf of the health department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with bse-affected herds. one argument put forward by the health department is that cjd has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if bse had triggered any cases of cjd. 'it is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of bse and the occurrence of disease in the patient.' the second annual report of will's national cjd surveillance unit in edinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a disturbing rise in incidence: from 32 uk cases in the year ended april 1991 to 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3. the epidemic continues to defy the ministry of agriculture's predictions that it is about to wane so far this year there have been 26,695 reported cases, compared with 25,898 to the same date last year.
