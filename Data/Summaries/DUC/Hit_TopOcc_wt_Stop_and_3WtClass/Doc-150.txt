carl lewis said he knew ben johnson was taking performance-enhancing drugs just after their 100-meter final last fall at the seoul olympics. now lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of johnson's drug test, which returned a positive result for the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol. according to francis' testimony, johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples. lewis said sunday that officials of the international amateur athletics federation should disallow johnson's world record from rome because francis has testified his sprinter took drugs before the world championships. if it has been proven that he took drugs, i would think that (withdrawing the record) is the responsible thing for the sport, lewis said sunday. according to testimony, since 1981 johnson has taken such drugs as furazabol, stanozolol and the human growth hormone, which is taken from the pituitary glands of human cadavers or can be taken in synthetic form. lewis, who won four gold medals at the 1984 summer games and has been one of the great sprinters and long jumpers in track and field, said he is determined to help the sport's image.
