augustus hawkins (d., calif.), who head the senate and house labor committees, are expected to introduce legislation to increase the minimum wage from its current rate of $3.35 an hour to about $4.65 hourly over three years, with future automatic annual adjustments. what's less certain is the shape the bill will finally take, and whether a veto is inevitable from a president who once said the minimum wage has caused more misery and unemployment than anything else since the great depression. republicans generally contend that the way to help the low-paid isn't by mandating higher pay and forcing some of them out of jobs but by expanding job training and education. nearly 3.5 million hourly workers earn the minimum wage, according to the labor department, but it's expected that any increase would also benefit the nearly 1.5 million workers who are paid below the minimum and others who earn slightly above the minimum. the historical goal has been a minimum wage equal to half the average wage for non-supervisory private workers, which is currently $8.88 an hour. reaching a consensus among the bill's backers has been difficult as strategists try to balance the concerns of labor and other interests with political expediency. republicans have warned they may counter the push to expand the minimum wage with a long-sought subminimum wage for teens, but an administration official says no decision has yet been made on its position on an increase.
