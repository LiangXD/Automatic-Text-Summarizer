here are excerpts of the speech to the security council on thursday by foreign minister ali-akbar velayati of iran, delivered in farsi and translated by the iranian mission: in the morning of sunday july 2, 1988, families and friends of 290 passengers and crew said farewell to their loved ones in tehran and bandar abbas airports _ unaware of the dastardly attack that awaited them, unaware of the tragic destiny that would be imposed upon them by a reckless and incompetent naval force led by aggressive and expansionist policy-makers. according to the transcript of the communication between the pilot and bandar abbas tower, before permission for takeoff was granted the tower asked the pilot to make sure that his transponder was turned on. uss vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as american officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from bandar abbas to dubai. notwithstanding the fact that the iranian air force had no f-14 operations in the morning of that unfortunate sunday in or around the strait of hormuz, it may be noted that the military experts well-familiar with f-14 and its capabilities have held that f-14 could not have presented any serious danger to the uss vincennes or any surface target for that matter. possibly the most fallacious argument of the american officials in justifying their inexplicable crime was a claim that the airliner did not respond to the alleged warnings issued by the warship. while every available evidence including the transcripts read earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any warning, many have contended that in such a short and routine flight, the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency civilian frequency. furthermore, positioning itself right in the middle of an international civil airway, it is ironic that the ship expected the plane to go outside of the corridor, not be coming onto the vincennes.
