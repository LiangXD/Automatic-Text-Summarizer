columbia savings &amp loan association has filed a $6 billion civil lawsuit accusing michael milken and other former drexel burnham lambert inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk bonds in the 1980s. the lawsuit, filed wednesday by the failing savings and loan, claims that milken and others manipulated and coerced columbia and other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky high-yield bonds. columbia, based in beverly hills, said in the lawsuit that milken and other drexel officials manipulated, coerced and deceived the thrift by promising that the market for the bonds would remain active and the thrift would make money. the 176-page lawsuit by columbia also claims that milken and other drexel employees appropriated stock in buyouts for themselves via the investment partnerships that should have gone to junk bond buyers in the deals. columbia was one of many savings and loans, big investors and other institutions that invested heavily in deals financed or supported by drexel in the 1980s. columbia says in the suit that its junk bonds have a total face value of $4.3 billion, but that it has written down their value to $2.5 billion to account for the decline in their market price. the suit says columbia was "ill-equipped" to make use of relaxed federal laws in the early 1980s that allowed thrifts to invest in corporate securities such as junk bonds.
