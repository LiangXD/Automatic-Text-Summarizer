monday's parliamentary declaration provides for establishing an independent legal system that would take precedence over federal laws and for slovenian control over armed forces stationed in the republic, state media said. the ljubljana nightly television news said the declaration asked slovenian authorities to "assume control over units of the (yugoslav) armed forces stationed on slovenian territory," and said a 30 percent cut in defense spending would be implemented. a coalition of center-right parties formed a new government last month in slovenia, the most prosperous of yugoslavia's six republics, after trouncing reform communists in the first free state elections held in communist-ruled yugoslavia in 45 years. the republic's new authorities demand that yugoslavia transform itself into a loose confederation of sovereign states. the slovenian declaration also said police should take over control of frontiers with neighboring italy and austria, replacing border guards deployed for the past 45 years by yugoslavia's communist government, ljubljana tv said. slovenia's president, milan kucan, has said that slovenia intends to proclaim sovereignty as part of its drive for liberal political and economic reform in yugoslavia. the timing of monday's proclamation by slovenia may have been affected by serbia's sudden decision last week to hold a special referendum sunday and monday on adopting consitutional reforms that would virtually destroy any remaining autonomy for its troubled province of kosovo.
