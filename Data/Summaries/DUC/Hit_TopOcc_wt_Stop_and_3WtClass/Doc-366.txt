as the senate takes up robert bork's nomination to the supreme court, we would like to believe that there might be some senators among his declared opponents with the statesmanship to admit they were initially misinformed. if these deliberations are serious, the evidence on this page and elsewhere the past two weeks should cause some thoughtful senators to reconsider. contrary to the smears, robert bork has not been a racist, sexist, sterilizer or bedroom spy in his careers as yale law professor, u.s. solicitor general or appeals judge. even harvard's laurence tribe got into the game by mischaracterizing judge bork's ninth amendment views, not to mention justice black's. now, to justify supporting this assault, the supposedly statesmanlike howell heflin is attacking judge bork from the right. he told an alabama radio station that he was troubled by judge bork's extremism -- an admission that he had been a socialist, a libertarian, that he nearly became a communist, and actually recruited people to attend communist party meetings, and had a strange life style. i was further disturbed by his refusal to discuss his belief in god -- or the lack thereof.
