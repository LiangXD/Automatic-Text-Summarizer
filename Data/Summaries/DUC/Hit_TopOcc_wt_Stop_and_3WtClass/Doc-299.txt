although it has always been difficult to measure the effect of crashes on travel, this accident comes just as people were starting to get over fears of terrorism related to the persian gulf war. about two hours before yesterday's crash, the national weather service in colorado springs issued its first high wind warning for the area since january, according to james hall, a meteorological technician observer in colorado springs. a federal aviation administration official said, there were some reports of gusting winds but whether or not that had any impact or whether there was any kind of mechanical problem, i can't speculate. another faa official said that although it is too early to pinpoint the cause, wind shear would be a major area of investigation. however, he said that wind shear is most dangerous when an aircraft is flying at a very low altitude, either shortly before landing or right after takeoff. in sunday's crash, the jetliner was a few miles from the airport and so should have been at a somewhat higher altitude. the plane was operated by an engine manufactured by united technologies corp.'s pratt &amp whitney division.
