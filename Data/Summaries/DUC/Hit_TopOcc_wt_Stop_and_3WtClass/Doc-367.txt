in that spirit, one of the latest to join the parade of let-me-tell-you-my-side authors is robert h. bork, the former appeals court judge who was nominated to the supreme court by president reagan but was rejected by the senate. but at a preview-of-coming-attractions press briefing at the annual convention of american booksellers assn. in washington over the weekend, bork -- the target of the first all-out, national political campaign to defeat a supreme court nominee -- insisted that his book was more about the general tendency to run law into politics than about his own particular unhappy experience. bork's constitutional expertise was one of the qualities that reagan said figured strongly in his decision to nominate bork for the supreme court and to support bork's decision to tough out his bitter, ultimately unsuccessful five-month fight for the position in 1987. many feared his effect on supreme court decisions because they said he already was too arrogant when contending that his interpretations of the law were the ones that best matched the original intent of the framers of the constitution. the founders of this nation thought the primary means of assuring our liberty was not the courts, bork said this weekend, but rather the assignment of different functions to different branches of government. whereas the constitution specified that laws were to be made by legislators who were elected by the people, not judges appointed by the president, bork said, a lot of americans now simply assume that the courts should produce results they like rather than sticking to the constitution. among consequences of this trend toward politicization of the courts, bork said, is that we may expect (judicial) confirmation battles that are increasingly bitter.
