scientists and engineers in chile, which has the distinction of playing host to the largest earthquake ever measured, are waiting with serious interest reports on the oct. the san francisco quake measuring 7.1 was comparable to the earthquake that struck santiago and central chile in march, 1985, killing 180 people and toppling some 70,000 homes. the frequency of earth movements prompts chileans to say that every president has at least one major earthquake during the traditional six-year term in office. the long history of earth movements in chile has led to a sharing of information with u.s. and japanese scientists and engineers over the behavior of the earth and of buildings during earthquakes. while california engineers have promoted a flexible design of steel framed buildings that allows them to swing in a quake, chileans opt for stiffer construction. just a few months before the 1906 earthquake in san francisco, a quake measuring 8.5 struck the central chilean coast, destroying the city of valparaiso. on may 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles long in southern chile, releasing energy nearly 1,000 times that of this year's san francisco quake.
