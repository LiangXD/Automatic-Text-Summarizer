judge thomas, who has been sitting on the federal appeals court in washington for just 14 months, won't be confirmed without a fight in the senate focusing on his inexperience on the bench and his strong opposition to affirmative action. while liberals will focus on judge thomas's legal inexperience, his record on the bench doesn't present them with the sort of target they had with the articulated, sharply conservative legal views of robert bork, whose supreme court nomination was defeated in 1987. a number of senate democrats, including judiciary chairman joseph biden of delaware, stressed when judge thomas was confirmed for the appeals court that he would face tougher scrutiny if he were nominated for the supreme court. judge thomas's strong opposition to affirmative action and the abortion debate will be grist for his confirmation hearings. as other supreme court nominees have done, however, judge thomas is likely to go to great lengths to avoid committing himself on abortion, an issue that is expected to come before the court again and again. the questions are: will judge thomas use the case to once again attack affirmative action, and will that pour fuel on his confirmation fight? in his press conference, mr. bush strongly denied the very thought of that, insisting that race wasn't a factor in the selection of judge thomas.
