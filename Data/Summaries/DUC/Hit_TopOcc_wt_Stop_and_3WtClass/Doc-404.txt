it's been like a big roller coaster ride about his release, anderson's 36-year-old brother john said from his home in ocala, fla. eight other westerners have been freed since august, when the united nations launched negotiations involving a complex swap of western hostages, hundreds of arabs held by israel, and information about missing israelis. confusion about anderson's whereabouts arose after a five-page arabic-language statement from the islamic jihad group that held anderson announced today he would be set free, but its wording was unclear as to whether he had already been released. anderson said in a videotaped statement released today by his captors to the associated press in damascus that he was to be freed. anderson's release marks the end of the seven-year american hostage drama in lebanon, which brought an outpouring of public support for the captives and put intense pressure on the reagan and bush administrations to get them out. the hostage-holders have in the past few years been isolated by the desire of syria and iran to improve ties with the west. this week's releases follow by days washington's payment to iran of $278 million for weaponry impounded during the 1979-80 tehran hostage crisis.
