house minority leader bob michel, r-ill., who met with bush and relayed his comments to reporters, said the president "made it abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility, not one penny, not one deviation" from his position on the minimum wage. edward m. kennedy, d-mass., would raise the hourly minimum from $3.35 to $4.65 by january 1992 and contains no provision allowing a lower wage for new workers. but kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his measure identical to the house bill passed two weeks ago, which has a final wage of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants in the job market a "sub-minimum" for two months. thad cochran, r-miss., told reporters afterward that "the message that was given to the president by the senate (gop) leadership was that we're going to stand with him on the minimum wage issue. but only about half of the 84 percent who initially favored a higher minimum wage said they would hold to that opinion even if it meant businesses would stop hiring, or would fire, workers because of added payroll costs caused by a higher minimum wage. a lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage said bush's repeated veto threats had all but quashed any hopes by democratic sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president. the president said his support for those increases hinges on a provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for six months regardless of any past experience with another employer.
