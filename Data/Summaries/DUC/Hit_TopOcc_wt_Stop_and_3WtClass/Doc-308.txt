believing this to be true, opponents of the reagan presidency then argued that his nomination of the like-minded judge bork was also illegitimate. we have argued continuously during these years that this argument was false, that the voters had indeed entrusted ronald reagan with a mandate (his campaign positions were clear) and that the losing side was trying to overturn the results of these elections. this doesn't mean that the american people support judge thomas -- or robert bork or ronald reagan -- in every detail of their political beliefs. that system has depended crucially on the support of an ideologically compliant washington press corps, which would normally render a target politically controversial and, in a risk-averse town, untouchable. washington's reporters, who had already largely broken away from the editorial controls of traditional journalism, even broke away from the congressional staffs and special-interest groups, building the sexual harassment story into a bonfire of personal and political grievances. the democratic party has to decide whether its future lies with the world view of the special-interest groups and anonymous congressional staff, or with people such as bill clinton, doug wilder, paul tsongas and others, mostly beyond-the-beltway governors, trying to conform the party's historic ideals to the temper of the modern electorate. but history will note that at the moment clarence thomas was about to be destroyed by the old order, the american people came forward and by the millions confirmed his appointment to the supreme court.
