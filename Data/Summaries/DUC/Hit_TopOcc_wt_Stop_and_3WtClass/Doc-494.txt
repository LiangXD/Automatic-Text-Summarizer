but the silky steeliness displayed during the crisis by powell, the first black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has revived discussion of moving vice president dan quayle out to make room for the general on the 1992 republican ticket. but on domestic issues, powell has signaled values that reflect the experiences that shaped him -- a course that led him down roads many republicans see only from inside their cars, with the windows sealed and the doors locked. powell is, after all, not a product of comfortable suburbia, but a son of jamaican immigrants who was born in harlem, grew up in the south bronx, watched his parents struggle to earn a living as a sales clerk and a seamstress in new york's garment district, attended the public city college of new york and joined the rotc during the 1950s, partly because it was one of the few institutions offering opportunities to blacks. though some blacks have criticized powell for being too cautious in addressing issues of concern to african-americans, he has, on several occasions, pointedly indicated that he has not forgotten those struggles. a few years ago, he told a dinner of the joint center for political and economic studies that he was mindful... that the struggle is not over... that the struggle will not be over until every american is able to find his or her own place in our society, limited only by his or her own ability. more recently, powell displayed impatience with the progress of that struggle, when he told a congressional committee questioning the large number of minority soldiers in the gulf war that he wish(ed) that there were other activities in our society... as open as the military is to upward mobility, to achievement, to allowing them in. rather, if he choose a political career as a democrat, powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's henry scoop jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions on defending u.s. interests abroad.
