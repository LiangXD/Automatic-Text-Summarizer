this new concept of triggering cancer cells to mature and die contrasts with the conventional concept of chemotherapy, in which drugs simply poison malignant cells. the drug used in the experimental treatment is known as tretinoin, which belongs to a class of chemicals called retinoic acids that are related to vitamin a. the tretinoin used in the leukemia patients, however, is a pill that was prepared for the experiment by chemists at hoffmann-la roche inc., the u.s. arm of roche holding ltd. of switzerland. the tip-off that an tretinoin-like drug might be effective in treating the leukemia came from a genetic finding, dr. raymond p. warrell jr. of memorial sloan-kettering and his colleagues in new york and at m.d. anderson cancer center in houston reported in this week's new england journal of medicine. this and other laboratory findings suggested that the immaturity of the leukemic white blood cells might somehow be related to a foul-up in the way the cells handled or failed to handle retinoic acid. the nature of the genetic damage also hinted that doses of retinoic acids might prod the immature malignant cells to proceed to maturity and then die as normal white blood cells do. but, he added, the u.s. group is the first to show that the drug works by triggering the immature cancer cells to mature, or to differentiate, in the biologists jargon.
