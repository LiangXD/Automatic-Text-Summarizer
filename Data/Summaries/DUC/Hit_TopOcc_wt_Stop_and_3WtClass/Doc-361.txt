he has been a law professor at yale and solicitor general of the u.s. as solicitor general, he was in charge not only of representing the u.s. before the supreme court but also of deciding when the government should appeal decisions to higher courts. commenting on judge bork's nomination to the supreme court, geoffrey stone, dean of the university of chicago law school, called it a four-star appointment and commented that it was rare to get anyone with anywhere near his credentials. judge bork's elevation to the supreme court may very well tip the balance toward this neutrality of interpretation, and there are those who fear that the court -- no longer able to do what the individual justices may think is good or moral or right -- will reject activist social, economic and criminal-justice agendas. more than 150 years earlier, francis bacon had warned judges to remember that their office is jus dicere, and not jus dare to interpret law, and not to make law, or give law. they began, in the words of the late supreme court justice felix frankfurter -- a social liberal but a judicial conservative -- infusing into the vagueness of constitutional or statutory provisions their mere private notions of social policy and traded their black robes of judgment for the mantle of what sociologist david reisman has called omnicompetent arrogance. this is how he put it in a september 1985 interview, which appeared in judicial notice: the job of a judge is to understand the principle that the framers were trying to protect, and apply that principle in today's circumstances, which the framers could not have foreseen. in many respects, the judiciary has become the master branch of government because we have permitted judges' personal views to supplant the rule of established law.
