"i've always said that my position on minimum wage is that i would want it linked to a training wage, to a differential of sorts, so that you don't throw people out of work by raising the minimum wage," bush said at a white house news conference. the president's comments came a day after mrs. dole told the senate labor committee that bush's support of legislation to raise the minimum wage would hinge on whether lawmakers included a training wage in the legislation. bush's stand puts him in opposition to the head of the labor committee, edward m. kennedy, who said thursday he remained opposed to a training wage and was confident his bill to raise the minimum hourly wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 would pass this year. mrs. dole, sworn in to her cabinet post four hours before the hearing, was not specific as to how high bush favors raising the minimum wage or what kind of time limit to set on the training wage. mrs. dole said she could help erase the so-called "skills gap" in the american labor force by working to better coordinate the numerous job-training programs of government agencies and placing an emphasis on training the poor and unemployed. in a brief interview after the hearing, kennedy, who introduced his minimum wage bill wednesday, said "my views haven't changed" and that he would try to get the bill through the senate without a provision for a training wage. organized labor supports the increased minimum wage but opposes the training wage, in part because it believes some employers would use the lower wage to cut their costs by hiring people at the training wage and laying off higher-paid workers.
