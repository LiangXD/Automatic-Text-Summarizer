mr kraai van niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on continued political reform in south africa, and prieska is the centre of his constituency. he had delivered a speech at another town that morning now he was pressing the flesh of his fellow farmers before addressing a house meeting in the late afternoon and another in the local town hall in the evening. when i went with him to his 13,000-hectare holding, which has an annual rainfall of just 6 inches and where temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s centigrade are normal throughout the long summer, he explained that the secret of success on such dry bush veldt was to restrict stocking rates (he runs only one merino wool sheep per 10 hectares) and to conserve what little moisture was available. it is, in fact, the arable farmers further east who are suffering most, as i had seen and heard for myself a few days earlier, and mr van niekerk has already set up committees of bankers, extension officers and local farmers' representatives, to try to find ways to avoid many of them going bankrupt. to allow vast numbers of farms to go out of business at a time when there is little enthusiasm, even among successful farmers for expansion, would put tens of thousands of black farm labourers out of work. some commentators have suggested that the port facilities are inadequate to handle such volumes within the time available but mr van niekerk assured me that his department had done the calculations and confirmed that they can and that imports have already begun to arrive. but in the meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the south african budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow.
