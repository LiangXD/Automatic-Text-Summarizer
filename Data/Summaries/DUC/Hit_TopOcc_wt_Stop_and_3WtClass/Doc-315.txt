by many estimates, milken probably achieved that milestone, because by the age of 30 he was a fast-rising star at the fast-rising securities firm of drexel burnham lambert inc., managing its high-yield junk bond operations and reaping huge profits for the firm and himself. milken virtually single-handedly pioneered the modern junk bond market, now worth $180 billion in total bonds outstanding, and the fuel that has financed hundreds of small- and middle-size businesses and wave after wave of corporate takeovers. he has indelibly changed the course and face of the investment banking business and the economy as a whole, said fredric roberts, head of a los angeles investment banking firm bearing his name and southern california district director for the national assn. of securities dealers. and while his junk bond machine transformed drexel from a second-rate securities firm into one of the most powerful on wall street, his alleged transgressions as its junk bond chief ultimately could be the firm's undoing. milken believed that investors were overly pessimistic about these bonds -- which often could be bought for as little as 20 cents or 30 cents on the dollar -- and that their higher yields more than compensated for their added risk of default. but despite the image of milken as a devoted father and charitable giver, federal investigators and critics believe that he built his junk bond empire partly on deceit and manipulation. although takeovers account for only about a fourth of junk bonds issued, the securities and exchange commission and federal prosecutors charge, among other things, that drexel's junk bond operations engaged in an array of securities violations, including market manipulation, inadequate disclosure, parking of securities to hide their true ownership and other infractions.
