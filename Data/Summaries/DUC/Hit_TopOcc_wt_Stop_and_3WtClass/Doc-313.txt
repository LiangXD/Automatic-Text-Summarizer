while the views of president bush's first supreme court nominee, david souter, were virtually unknown before his confirmation, the 43-year-old mr. thomas has boldly articulated his vision of constitutional law, both as a judge -- he now sits on the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, the nation's second-highest bench -- and, before that, as chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission for eight years. mr. thomas maintains, with support from abraham lincoln and abolitionist frederick douglass, that the constitution must be read in the context of the principle of equality inherent in the declaration of independence. it is here, under the stern tutelage of his grandfather, myers anderson, that mr. thomas locates the beginning of his true education. at a conference of black conservatives in san francisco, calif., mr. thomas's eloquent departures from the civil rights orthodoxy on quotas and government handouts greatly impressed the newly installed reagan administration, and in 1981 he was nominated to be assistant secretary for civil rights in the department of education. mr. thomas had his skirmishes with the leadership conference on civil rights, an umbrella group instrumental in defeating the bork nomination, and he made a dangerous enemy in the american association of retired persons, which accused him of letting legal protections for the elderly lapse. the reason for the smooth passage, eeoc vice chairman ricky silber man (whose husband laurence silberman sits on the d.c. circuit with mr. thomas and is his closest friend on the bench) thinks, is that clarence has an amazing ability to neutralize opposition. while at the eeoc, mr. thomas gave speeches accusing the republican party of blatant indifference toward black voters, and chastised ronald reagan in particular for letting bob jones university get away with racial discrimination, and for foot dragging on the voting rights act extension.
