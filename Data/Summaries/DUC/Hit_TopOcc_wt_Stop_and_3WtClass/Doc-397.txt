carlson, commander of the uss sides, a frigate that was on the scene when the uss vincennes shot down the airbus on july 3, 1988, clearly put the blame on actions taken by the ship and disputed any notion of self-defense. will rogers, skipper of the vincennes at the time, said carlson's assessment was subjective and not in line with the navy's conclusions. "the navy investigated the events of july 3, 1988, in excruciating detail and published its findings in the fogarty report," rogers said in a statement issued by the navy in san diego, where he is stationed. "commander carlson's comments in the magazine article are his personal opinions of the airbus incident," he said. "it's published by the naval institute, a private self-supported non-profit professional society and it's a forum for people to express personal opinions and assertions in various articles related to navy issues, but the naval institute is not part of the u.s. government, so his comments are his own personal opinion," he said. on the day of the incident, carlson said, a crewman informed him that the vincennes had classified the plane as an iranian f-14 fighter. "the vincennes saw an opportunity for action, and pressed hard for commander middle east force to give permission to fire," carlson said.
