a study has found that the u.s. death toll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted, the head of the national hurricane center said tuesday to mark the opening of the 1988 atlantic storm season. recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for the atlantic and gulf coasts show that many more people than earlier thought must be evacuated under certain conditions, said center director bob sheets. "it's quite possible this year that we could lose goes-west at anytime," hurricane specialist bob case said of the geo-stationary earth-orbiting environmental satellite, which records atmospheric conditions over the pacific ocean and part of the western hemisphere. if that satellite does stop working, goes-east would have to be directed to move from its equatorial orbit over brazil to a spot south of the texas gulf coast, where it would provide a view of the western hemisphere with limited vision in the hurricane-spawning eastern atlantic, he said. 30, has 10 named tropical storms with rain and maximum sustained wind exceeding 39 mph, six of which become hurricanes with drenching rain and wind over 74 mph, case said. hurricane arlene meandered through the atlantic in mid-august with top wind of 75 mph. here are the names to be given to atlantic tropical storms that could grow into hurricanes this season: alberto, beryl, chris, debby, ernesto, florence, gilbert, helene, isaac, joan, keith, leslie, michael, nadine, oscar, patty, rafael, sandy, tony, valerie and william.
