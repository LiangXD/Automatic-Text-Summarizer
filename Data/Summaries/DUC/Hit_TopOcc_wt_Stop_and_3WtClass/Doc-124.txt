the legislation - known as the brady bill after mr james brady, the former white house press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on president ronald reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on purchases of handguns. advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over stubborn resistance by republican senators from western states such as idaho and alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the us. despite its uncertain effect, passage of the brady bill is read by some as a sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control. paradoxically, while thousands of people have been telephoning their republican senators to demand that they stop blocking the brady bill, thousands have also been flocking to join the national rifle association, the leading organisation among the pro-gun lobbies. although democratic governor jim florio of new jersey came close to victory in the gubernatorial race this month by striking a tougher stance on both guns and crime in general than his republican challenger, mrs christine todd whitman, this was not enough. second, the nra's insistence on combating any gun control, even that viewed as reasonable by a majority not just of the us population but of gun-owners, has driven away some former political and police supporters. these converts to gun control, however, are a long way from believing that the answer to violent crime lies in more radical action, such as the proposal of senator john chafee, a rhode island republican, for a complete ban on handguns.
