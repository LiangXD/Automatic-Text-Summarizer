he's expected to win easy senate confirmation and make history as the first black and the youngest-ever officer to hold the post. powell, who served as national security adviser in the final year of president ronald reagan's administration, will succeed adm. "as we face the challenges of the '90s, it is most important that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff be a person of breadth, judgment, experience and total integrity," bush said. "he was marvelous to work with, because he could deal with all the internal conflicts" that the national security council adviser must resolve for the president, said dan howard, former nsc spokesman who was recently confirmed as undersecretary of the navy. as well, powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political finesse with congress are as essential as toughened battlefield instincts. he was a key figure in the planning of reagan's national security strategy and for his summits with soviet leader mikhail s. gorbachev. powell served in southeast asia as an adviser to south vietnamese units in 1962 and 1963 and as executive officer of an infantry battalion and as a division operations officer in 1968 and 1969.
