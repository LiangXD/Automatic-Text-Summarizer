typhoon yunya, packing 80 mph winds, slammed into the eastern coast of luzon island, which includes mount pinatubo, early in the day. meanwhile, president corazon aquino dismissed a british newspaper report that americans had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages nuclear storage sites at clark air base, abandoned monday by nearly 15,000 americans. the u.s. military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000 americans who crowded onto subic bay naval base as a bizarre tropical blizzard of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base friday during a third day of increasingly violent eruptions of mount pinatubo. headlights and street lamps were turned on at midafternoon as a dark, black cloud passed over the giant navy base and dropped a gritty rain of mud drops, she said. five explosions shook the mountain early today, showering ash over a wide area and providing a spectacular pre-dawn display of nature's fireworks against a backdrop of lightning and rain. raymundo punongbayan, director of the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology, said friday's blasts were part of a single eruption, the largest since mount pinatubo awoke sunday from its 600-year slumber. a british newspaper, the guardian, reported thursday that the americans declared a nuclear alert at clark late wednesday and informed governments in manila and hong kong that a nuclear accident in the region was possible.
