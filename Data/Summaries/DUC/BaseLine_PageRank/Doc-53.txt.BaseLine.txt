In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years. He instructed his charges to draw up plans for immediate action that would enable poor families to achieve real and lasting emancipation from welfare dependency. The success of welfare, he said, should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare. The president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families. Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty. To pull away now would be to undercut the welfare-reform movement just as it has hit its stride. This suggests that the Democrats aren't as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the American public are. The Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy. This past December, a coalition of some 80 organizations, most with headquarters in Washington, issued a statement of principles calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs.
