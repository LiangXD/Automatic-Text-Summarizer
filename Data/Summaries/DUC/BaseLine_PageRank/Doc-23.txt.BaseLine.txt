In mid-June, a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department was settled when police agreed to stop using a martial-arts weapon, nunchakus, while arresting anti-abortion advocates.; Hundreds have charged that police in more than 50 cities have used excessive force in removing demonstrators intent on closing down abortion facilities. The demonstrators, most associated with Operation Rescue, have charged and testified that police tactics used during the past 2 1/2 years in cities such as Denver, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles have resulted in serious injury and led to sexual abuse against women who have been arrested.; Operation Rescue, which draws participants largely from conservative Catholic and Protestant circles, is a national movement that organizes demonstrations at abortion facilities. Other scenes show police apparently placing fingers into the nostrils of one demonstrator and grabbing the breast of a female protester to force compliance.; The settlement over police use of nunchakus in Los Angeles, like the videos and photographs showing police using pain compliance techniques on Rescue participants, received little attention from the public, civil rights groups or the press. I am concerned that anti-abortion protesters are receiving selective prosecution and selectively harsh treatment, unlike that received by other demonstrators for other causes, said Allen, who generally opposes abortion.; Colleen O'Connor, the American Civil Liberties Union's national public education director, and Carol Sobel, the ACLU's senior staff counsel in Los Angeles, said they agree that police have abused Operation Rescue participants.
