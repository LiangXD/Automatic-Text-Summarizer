Typhoon Yunya, packing 80 mph winds, slammed into the eastern coast of Luzon island, which includes Mount Pinatubo, early in the day. About 84,000 people, including Americans, have been evacuated.; Police said 12 people had been arrested for looting at Clark.; Five explosions shook the mountain early today, showering ash over a wide area and providing a spectacular pre-dawn display of nature's fireworks against a backdrop of lightning and rain.; Friday, eight thunderous explosions shot a cloud of ash and steam nearly 19 miles high.; Friday's eruptions hurled ash over Clark, 10 miles east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles southwest, where the Clark personnel had been temporarily housed. But Aquino told reporters the story was baseless and purely fabricated. ; The United States refuses to confirm or deny that it stores nuclear weapons in the Philippines.; Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus also said the eruption should have no effect on talks on the future of Clark and Subic, where leases expire Sept.
