The plane, normally equipped to carry nuclear bombs, crashed about 1:15 a.m., said Lt. During such maneuvers, landing gears touch the ground but the plane doesn't land. All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman. The crew members crawled or were helped out of the front section of the aircraft, he said. Members of the crew suffered broken bones, but no one was burned, said Capt. Senior Airman Tim Sanders, another base spokesman, said those aboard were Capt. Mark Hartney, 29, an aircraft commander from Mulberry, Fla.; 1st Lt. Michael S. Debruzzi, 26, a pilot from New Brighton, Minn.; Capt. Anthony D. Phillips, 28, a radar navigator from Folkston, Ga.; 1st Lt. James W. Herrmann, 30, a navigator from Sharpsville, Pa.; 1st Lt. William R. Kroeger, 52, an instructor pilot from Fountain Hills, Ariz.; and 1st Lt. Gregory C. Smith, 26, an upgrade pilot from Henning, Minn. Hartney was the aircraft commander, but Debruzzi also was qualified to fly the plane, Bailey said. She did not know who was at the controls at the time of the crash. The Air Force has had more trouble recently with the B-52's successor, the B-1B bomber. Although smaller than the B-52, the B-1B can fly at supersonic speeds and carry more bombs.
