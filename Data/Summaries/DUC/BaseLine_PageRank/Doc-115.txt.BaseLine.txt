The lawsuit, which has been pending for nine months, arose out of two articles published by the Enquirer in June 1990 reporting on Miss Taylor's condition and activities at St. John's Hospital, Santa Monica, Calif., where she was treated last spring for pneumonia. Miss Taylor said she feels completely vindicated, and that after the newspaper's management determined the articles were in error, the Enquirer acted promptly and in good faith.
