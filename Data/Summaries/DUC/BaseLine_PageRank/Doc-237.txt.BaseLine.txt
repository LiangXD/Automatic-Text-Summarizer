The so-called NADBank has been strongly supported by Congressman Esteban Torres, who has insisted on some sort of lending institution to support adjustment throughout the continent. It is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants a reason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it is pushing feverishly to turn anti-Nafta public opinion around. The White House 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110 Republicans in favour, 65-75 Democrats in favour; and 20-30 leaning towards it. Members of the cabinet are being sent to congressional districts, where they visit and publicise factories that are expected to gain jobs if Nafta passes. He envisioned continent-wide free trade 'when we'll have over 700m people in this trading bloc, united in believing that we can help one another grow and flourish,' he said.
