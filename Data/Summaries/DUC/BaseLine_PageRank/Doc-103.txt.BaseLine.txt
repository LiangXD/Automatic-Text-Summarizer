Thousands more acres of brush and timber went up in smoke Saturday in seven states in the West, threatening homes in some places, and firefighters contended with wind and high temperatures. "As the day heats up, you'll get these reburns going out and the trees dry out and they'll torch," said Forest Service spokesman Ed Christian in Wyoming. "We hope Mother Nature cooperates with us," said Mary Plumb of the federal Bureau of Land Management in Utah. Elsewhere, four big fires burned in interior Alaska, one having charred an estimated 24,000 acres. The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates federal firefighting efforts, listed 7,000 to 7,500 people on the fire lines, along with 42 air tankers, 14 guide planes and 10 helicopters, spokesman Arnold Hartigan said Saturday. So far this fire season, the agency has had 31,000 fires reported, which have burned 1,117,000 acres. The fact that there are more acres burned this year, but fewer fires, "means this year's fires are in very rugged, inaccessible terrain, which makes them hard to fight," said Hartigan. "Also, some of them are in areas where there have not been any fires for years, and that means there is excellent fuel available." It was 80 percent contained, but after a week of temperatures around 100 degrees, the National Weather Service predicted possible dry lightning storms and gusting wind. Forest Service spokeswoman Cece Stewart said three helicopters scattered incendiary bombs made of chemically treated plastic balls on an unburned 200-acre area between fire lines and the main fire in an effort to stop the fire's advance. High wind also was expected in northern California, where a 2,500-acre fire near Janesville on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada destroyed two mobile homes. Relentless winds first pushed the fire north, then south, prompting Sheriff Ron Jarrel to order the evacuation of a sparsely populated area about a mile south of the fire line, Reider said.
