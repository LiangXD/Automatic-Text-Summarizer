We've had no report of any wildlife hurt at this time, he said. But environmentalists feared that if the oil reached the shore, marine birds would be threatened. Environmentalists also expressed concern about whales, sea lions and other wildlife. Infuriated local residents and environmentalists complained about the slow pace of the cleanup. Critical of Efforts Where was the crackerjack response team that was supposed to be out there? They are moving way too slowly, said University of Alaska professor Richard Steiner, who flew over the slick Friday. There (was) no oil (cleanup equipment) out there and it's been 14 hours since it happened. We saw six sea lions inside the slick, swimming, trying to avoid it, and they had no idea which way to go. Cindy Lowry, Alaska regional director for Greenpeace, also complained about the pace of the cleanup. It is more than 12 hours later and there is no (cleanup) boom, no sweepers. This will affect everything in the food chain, from crab larvae to orca whales. Floating Oil Booms Gonzales, the Coast Guard spokesman, said the terminal has cleanup equipment on site for minor spills. Prince William Sound, home to orcas, sea otters and fur seals, is important to both the fishing and the recreation industries. It's also a pretty well-established tourist attraction, with sailing and glacier viewing trips. Expected Worst But this could be a catastrophic occurrence, so we're concerned, he said. Living in Valdez, we've always worried that sometime something like this could happen. Cowper said that conventional responses, such as booms, probably would not work because the spill is so large. You probably couldn't do it (contain the spill) with all the equipment available in North America.
