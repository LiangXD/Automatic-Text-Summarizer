Her condition is presently stabilizing, and her physicians are pleased with her progress. The statement provided no additional details of Taylor's condition, and hospital officials declined to comment beyond the statement. Lisa del Favero, a New York City publicist for Taylor, said the actress is seriously ill, but she's not on her deathbed. Taylor's doctors expect to have results of the biopsy by Thursday, she said. Del Favero said Taylor's four children -- Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and Michael Wilding -- were with her at the hospital. If you don't know what the trouble is, you grab a biopsy and study it, because that's where the problem is, Mohler explained. If they (took a biopsy), I'm sure she was not responding to antibiotics. Mohler said Taylor's doctors are taking a prudent course by placing her on a ventilator. Taylor, 58, entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey on April 10 suffering what her publicist then described as a severe sinus infection.
