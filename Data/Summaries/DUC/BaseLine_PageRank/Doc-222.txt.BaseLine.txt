The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is floundering, and the international tin cartel has collapsed. Sales still soared 40% to a near-record $2.56 billion, double the $1.26 billion posted in the 1982 doldrums. Figures for 1986 aren't yet available, but De Beers says it was another record. About three-fourths of American women own diamond engagement rings that cost an average $1,300. General diamond image advertising aims at perpetuating the mystique of quality diamonds as the ultimate expression of love, he says. One out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings two decades ago. Now two-thirds do, and Japan is the second-largest diamond jewelry market, followed by West Germany. As the sole middleman, De Beers usually avoids the acrimony that has divided other cartels. The dealer must accept or reject the entire box, valued at between $1 million and $25 million. The cartel hasn't cut prices since it was founded more than half a century ago. OPEC members tend to do what they like, says Jo Flies, chief economist of the Antwerp Diamond Council. Some analysts warn, however, that De Beers's future may be affected by the surge in diamond output elsewhere, notably Australia. The Soviet Union, which produces an estimated 12 million carats of top-grade diamonds annually, is another unknown. International sanctions, including a possible U.S. import ban on South African diamonds, pose a growing threat. Recent history indicates, however, that it would be hasty to write off the cartel. While average prices of De Beers's rough diamonds rose 37%, prices of polished diamonds in dealers' stocks collapsed. The top-grade investment diamond, D-Flawless, tumbled to around $8,000 a carat in 1985 from an average of $55,000 in 1980. Meanwhile, diamond demand by consumers increased, fueled by De Beers's promotion campaign and favorable economic trends. Since November 1985, prices of D-Flawless diamonds have risen 56% to around $14,000 a carat.
