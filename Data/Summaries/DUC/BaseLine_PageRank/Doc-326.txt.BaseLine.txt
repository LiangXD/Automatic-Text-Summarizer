In response to questions about Mr. Sununu's recent shift to use of corporate jets in the wake of restrictions imposed last month on his use of government planes, the White House released the list of five jets the chief of staff has used for travel to fund-raisers. The identity of owners of two of the jets already had been publicized, and the others are not large national corporations. Boyden Gray's office approved all the travel in advance, and he vetoed some suggested corporate jets because of potential conflicts of interest, White House officials said. Use of corporate jets for political travel is legal provided the corporation is reimbursed for providing the ride or reports the travel as an in-kind political contribution. On June 7, Mr. Sununu used a jet provided by Fiber Materials Inc. of Biddeford, Maine, to travel to a fund-raiser for the Maine Republican party. He had taken his White House limousine to reach nearby New York to attend a stamp auction before that event.
