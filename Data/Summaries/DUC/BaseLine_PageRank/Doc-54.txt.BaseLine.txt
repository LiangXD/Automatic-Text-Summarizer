While there is agreement in virtually every quarter that something needs to be done about welfare, disagreement remains over exactly what to do. They would require all able-bodied welfare recipients (except mothers with children under 3 years of age) to work in exchange for their benefits. Those who do would be eligible for help with education and training, day care and transportation. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, even backed off earlier criticism of the administration's welfare plan, saying after the White House meeting, I feel better about the prospects of welfare reform than I did yesterday. However committed the administration and Congress may be to reform, they're unlikely to endorse a plan that increases the deficit. By setting aside more money for job training, day care and other support, they say, taxpayers would ultimately realize savings as welfare recipients are weaned from the public rolls. But taxpayers can be forgiven if they view this part of the governors' argument with skepticism. After all, Americans have spent more than $1 trillion over the past two decades to alleviate poverty and curb dependency without seeing evidence of an appreciable return on their substantial investment. Nonetheless there is merit in the governors' plan, as there is in the administration's reform proposals, and in the reform bills under consideration in the Senate. Only by requiring individual initiative and productivity can welfare recipients ever achieve self-sufficiency.
