Thus he says that In this version, 'bearing arms' must mean 'to render military service,' or why else would there have to be an exemption for religious reasons? Plainly, any conscientious-objector provision would arise not from a right but from a duty to serve in the militia. Yet Mr. Goldwin believes the amendment means, as he later says, that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the militia. Roger Pilon Senior Fellow and Director Center for Constitutional Studies CATO Institute Washington --- The militia is not the National Guard but rather the people of the original states. Thomas Jefferson moved to prevent this type of power in a few people's hands by the Second Amendment. He stated, No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. It is unfortunate today's scholars seem to spend their time picking apart history and the great thoughts of the visionary men who formed this country. Samuel R. Bush III Cincinnati --- Let those who want guns join the National Guard, says Mr. Goldwin. Plea bargaining was not epidemic; judges did not provide revolving doors on prisons. If anything, the reasons for citizens to own weapons for self-defense are more compelling today than they were in 1791. Consider that George Mason (1725-1792), the great Virginia constitutionalist, defined quite clearly the meaning of the word militia during a debate in 1788. I, along with millions of other Americans, am not against sensible gun control, i.e., licensing, character searches, etc. Edward F. Menninger Sterling Heights, Mich. --- Mr. Goldwin suggests gun control via enlistment in the National Guard.
