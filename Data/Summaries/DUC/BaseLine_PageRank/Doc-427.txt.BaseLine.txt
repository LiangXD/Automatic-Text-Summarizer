Her husband had just died, and years of suffering from diabetes had left her without sight in one eye and only limited vision in the other. </P> <P> The one ray of hope was financial. Prudently invested, it would help support her modest but comfortable life in Santa Maria, Calif. </P> <P> But Lampel reckoned without Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and Arizona home builder Charles H. Keating Jr., who had acquired the thrift the year before. Shunning traditional home mortgages, they channeled the S&amp;L's funds into huge tracts of raw land in Arizona, luxurious hotel projects, a portfolio of junk bonds and other speculative ventures, according to federal regulators. </P> <P> Now, federal and state investigators, regulators and lawmakers are poring over the details of Keating's activities. Already, regulators have filed a civil racketeering lawsuit accusing Keating and other Lincoln executives of squandering $1.1 billion in federally insured deposits through a series of illegal, fraudulent and imprudent acts. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other senators who accepted large campaign contributions from Keating and then intervened with regulators on his behalf. </P> <P> Compounding the ultimate cost to others, Keating and his associates sold about $200 million in now-worthless debt securities to unwary customers such as Mrs. Lampel at Lincoln's branch offices. Many of the purchasers were elderly Southern Californians who thought the securities -- issued by Lincoln's parent company -- were federally insured. </P> <P> Keating has repeatedly denied the government's charges. That, not his own actions, drove Lincoln to ruin, he says. </P> <P> As a longtime home builder and mortgage lender, he said, his operation always has concentrated on single-family housing. The close association they developed continued long after Keating left Cincinnati in 1976 to take over a foundering Lindner real estate development firm in Phoenix. </P> <P> A few years after moving West, Keating had his first serious brush with federal regulators. They were also allowed to place customer funds in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds and other non-traditional investments. </P> <P> Real estate developers saw the thrifts as ideal sources of cash for their own ventures. In addition, the rules required thrift owners to put up only $3 of their own cash for every $100 in S&amp;L investments. The capital requirement for banks was twice as high: $6 for every $100 in assets. </P> <P> California was an especially tempting target for such takeovers. He also bought the Hotel Pontchartrain, a troubled hotel in downtown Detroit, and initiated elaborate renovations. </P> <P> -- He used Lincoln funds to buy junk bonds and dabble in foreign currency trading. Edwin J. Gray, whose position as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board made him the nation's top savings and loan regulator, was one of them. </P> <P> Across the country, S&amp;Ls were using their customers' money to acquire stakes in windmill farms, restaurants and a host of other businesses they knew little about. Such investments, far from returning the industry to health, were bringing new losses so huge they threatened the solvency of the federal deposit insurance fund. </P> <P> Gray began speaking out. What's more, he proposed a rule to require all federally insured thrifts, including state-chartered S&amp;Ls such as Lincoln, to limit direct investments to 10% of their assets. </P> <P> Keating for one was furious. Arguing that Gray's proposed restriction would destroy the industry, Keating began lobbying hard against it. </P> <P> He hired Alan Greenspan, a respected economist who had served as a senior official in the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations and now heads the Federal Reserve Board, to analyze the proposed rule. Greenspan produced a report opposing it. </P> <P> Although executives at other savings and loans also lobbied against the direct investment rule, Keating was perhaps the most prominent and persistent opponent. </P> <P> Keating arranged for a congressional resolution that called on Gray to delay implementing the investment restriction for six months. Although 225 House members signed the resolution, it failed to sway the regulators. </P> <P> Unable to stop the restriction, Keating found a way to blunt its impact on Lincoln. </P> <P> The Gray rule would be adopted in early 1985, Keating learned, but would be applied retroactively to Dec. 10, 1984; any direct investments made before that date would be permitted to stand, even if they exceeded the 10% limit. </P> <P> Three days before the expected deadline, Lincoln won approval from the California Department of Savings and Loan to move an additional $800 million into direct investments. That increased Lincoln's direct investments to about 40% of its $2.2 billion in assets. </P> <P> Customers Targeted </P> <P> In 1986, Keating and his executives came up with an innovative way to raise unrestricted funds for American Continental: They would sell debt securities similar to the bonds issued by most of America's major corporations. But, instead of selling them through Wall Street brokerages and other investment firms, they would peddle the securities to Lincoln customers. </P> <P> The California Department of Corporations routinely approved American Continental's first request to sell the debt securities, called subordinated debentures. The California Department of Corporations approved the sales, even though the agency's own staff and the state's top savings and loan regulators expressed concern about the company's financial condition and ability to repay the debt. </P> <P> In little more than two years, American Continental sold about $200 million worth of debt securities to nearly 22,000 investors. Wall, a former staff aide to the Senate Banking Committee, said that there was insufficient evidence to justify the extreme action proposed by the San Francisco overseers. </P> <P> If the rebuff angered the regional examiners, what came next stunned them. A year later, Wall stripped them of their supervisory responsibility for Lincoln and transferred jurisdiction to Washington. </P> <P> Wall said an internal investigation had determined that substantial animosity had developed between Lincoln and the San Francisco regulators and that leaks of confidential financial information had damaged the savings and loan. Wall ordered a new examination directed by Washington-based regulators. </P> <P> Instead of absolving Lincoln, however, the new audit reached even more damaging conclusions. Among other things, it called into question the tax-sharing plan Lincoln and its accountants had devised in 1986. </P> <P> As a subsidiary of American Continental, Lincoln did not deal directly with the Internal Revenue Service on taxes. (D-Mich.) -- had received more than $300,000 in campaign contributions from Keating, his family and his business associates. </P> <P> In addition, Cranston solicited $850,000 from Keating for three voter registration groups that signed up primarily Democrats. And McCain's wife and her father invested nearly $360,000 in a 1986 Keating partnership that put up a Phoenix shopping center. </P> <P> The first meeting, on April 2, 1987, involved bank board Chairman Gray and Sens. They say they met with Gray to discuss the unusually lengthy audit of Lincoln by the San Francisco regional office; their only message, the four senators say, was that the regulators should charge Keating with something or get off his back. </P> <P> The second meeting occurred a week later. Lincoln's regular depositors would be made whole by taxpayers through the federal deposit insurance program, but the 22,000 investors who had bought the American Continental debt securities were left holding worthless paper. There was no federal insurance for them. </P> <P> One of those investors was Shirley Lampel. </P> <P> In 1985, Lampel's husband had died of a heart attack at the age of 58. With Social Security payments and the monthly income from her husband's $30,000 life insurance proceeds, she would make it. </P> <P> One day, after moving from Santa Maria to Tustin, she had noticed a large newspaper advertisement about an investment opportunity being offered at a Lincoln office near her condominium. She took her life insurance proceeds and practically beat down the door at the Lincoln branch to buy American Continental debt securities. </P> <P> After being assured that Lincoln was safe and sound, she had signed two pieces of paper and handed over a $30,000 cashier's check. She could not read the fine print, and she said no one ever read the documents to her. </P> <P> I thought I was buying something similar to a certificate of deposit, she said.
