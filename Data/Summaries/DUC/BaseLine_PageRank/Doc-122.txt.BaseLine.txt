The Constitution was ratified without adopting any of the scores of proposed amendments. But in several states ratification came only with solemn pledges that amendments would follow. In this version, bearing arms must mean to render military service, or why else would there have to be an exemption for religious reasons? But what about the private right to keep and bear arms, to own a gun for self-defense and hunting? But such facts tell us almost nothing relevant to our question. The Constitution nevertheless says nothing about the undeniable right to own a dog. There are uncountable numbers of rights not enumerated in the Constitution. These rights are neither denied nor disparaged by not being raised to the explicit constitutional level. Every free able-bodied white male citizen (it was 1792, after all) was required by the act to enroll in the militia for training and active service in case of need. When reporting for service, every militiaman was required to provide a prescribed rifle or musket, and ammunition. Here we see the link of the private and public aspects of bearing arms. The expectation was that every man would have his own firearms. What does this mean for the question of gun control today? In plain 1990s English, if you want to own a gun, sign up with the National Guard. Restoring a 200-year-old understanding of the Constitution may be difficult, but there isn't time to dawdle. Americans now own more than 200 million guns, and opinion polls show Americans want gun control.
