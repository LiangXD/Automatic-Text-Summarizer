A 66-year-old physician, a botanist and a marine biologist were among four men and four women picked today to spend two years inside a 2\-acre sealed dome intended to be a microcosm of Earth. The eight from the United States, West Germany, England and Belgium will be the crew of the giant terrarium known as Biosphere II. The privately financed $30 million project aims for a December start. Two others who had been finalists included Norberto Alvarez-Romo, 37, of Guadalajara, Mexico, and Silke Schneider, 31, a West German.
