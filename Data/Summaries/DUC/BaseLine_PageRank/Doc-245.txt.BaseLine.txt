The lawmakers who replaced the Communists as leaders of the prosperous northern republic of Slovenia have proclaimed the state's full sovereignty, but stopped short of calling for secession. There was no immediate reaction to the Slovenian declaration from federal authorities or from rival Serbia. Monday's parliamentary declaration provides for establishing an independent legal system that would take precedence over federal laws and for Slovenian control over armed forces stationed in the republic, state media said. The document said Slovenia should adopt a new democratic constitution within the next 12 months, but made no mention of earlier calls for the republic to secede from the troubled Yugoslav federation. The media said a joint session of the republic's 240-seat legislature voted unanimously to adopt the Declaration of Sovereignty of the State of Slovenia. The republic's new authorities demand that Yugoslavia transform itself into a loose confederation of sovereign states. They threaten that Slovenia will declare full independence from Yugoslavia if the remaining republics do not accept its proposals for a confederation. Premier Lojze Peterle and other Slovenian leaders also say Slovenia should take urgent steps to join the European Community, no matter what Yugoslavia's Communist-ruled southern states say.
