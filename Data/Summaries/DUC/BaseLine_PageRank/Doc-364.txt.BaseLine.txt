Legal experts differed sharply in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over what impact Judge Robert Bork's free-market approach to antitrust law would have on competition and consumers. Meanwhile, President Reagan launched a new, more vigorous campaign on behalf of Judge Bork's nomination, which is losing momentum. There are three I can count on for sure, he told reporters. He added: They're pretty experienced and tough and may be able to withstand White House pressure to support Judge Bork. Packwood's prediction is significant because moderate Republicans are one of two groups, along with southern Democrats, who may tip the balance for or against Judge Bork in the closely divided Senate. Democratic strategists say they need at least three or four Republican votes against the nomination to defeat it. Cranston said on Tuesday that he estimated 49 votes against Judge Bork, 40 in favor and 11 undecided. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the chief Republican vote counter in the Senate, also disputed Mr. Cranston's count. In yesterday's testimony, Robert Pitofsky, dean of Georgetown University Law School and a former Federal Trade Commission member, said Judge Bork advocates an antitrust program more conservative than proposed by almost anyone else. But in testimony delivered Tuesday night, Mr. Baker and University of Michigan Law School professor Thomas Kauper praised Mr. Bork's contribution to antitrust theory. Mr. Kauper said there isn't any reason to assume Judge Bork would overrule antitrust precedents or federal laws and that Judge Bork advocates an antitrust approach designed to promote consumer welfare. We will not be satisfied with allowing special interests to determine the qualifications to serve on our country's highest court, he asserted.
