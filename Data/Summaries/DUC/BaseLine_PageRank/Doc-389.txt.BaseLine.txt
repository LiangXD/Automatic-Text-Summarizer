According to the transcript of the communication between the pilot and Bandar Abbas tower, before permission for takeoff was granted the tower asked the pilot to make sure that his transponder was turned on. The plane was flying on a scheduled flight using the internationally established and published Amber 59 airway that is used at least 14 times a week, five of which between the same two airports. Seconds after the last communication between the plane and the tower, the plane was targeted by two surface-to-air Standard guided missiles from USS Vincennes, the most technologically sophisticated naval ship.... USS Vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as American officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai. Another story which was fabricated to misguide the international public opinion was the claim by the United States that the airliner was not transmitting the appropriate signals. Crowe claimed on July 3, 1988: "There were electronic indications on Vincennes that led it to believe that the aircraft was an F-14." F-14 fighters, as it should be known most vividly to the Americans who made them, are designed for air-to-air attack and not air-to-surface operations. Possibly the most fallacious argument of the American officials in justifying their inexplicable crime was a claim that the airliner did not respond to the alleged warnings issued by the warship.
