Last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths, but even so, more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation. Unusually warm and wet weather last November helped trigger a record number of tornadoes for that month, at 121 across the country. That took place on Mother's Day when 57 twisters tore through parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. Arkansas and Tennessee recorded the most fatalities last year with six deaths apiece, followed by Florida with five. Four people were killed in North Carolina and two each in Mississippi and Nebraska. States with a single fatality apiece were Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. The transition from winter to spring, spurring unsettled weather and frequent thunderstorms, helps create tornadoes, violently twisting winds that reach down from thunderclouds. June ranks second, averaging 150 tornadoes, followed by April with 109 in a typical year. Other months averaging more than a twister-a-day somewhere in the nation are July, 82; August, 57; March, 50 and September, 38. The weather service even has its own radio network which can provide continual updates.
