The single-engine Cessna 177 crashed Sunday night in thick woods near the tiny community of Janice. Searchers combed the heavily wooded DeSoto National Forest through the night but were unable to find the wreckage until Monday morning, when they spotted it from the air. There was a 300-foot-long path cut by the plane, Harrison County Sheriff's Department Capt. Smith, 45, died the same day the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) and 15 others was found on an Ethiopian mountainside. We (the congressional delegation) had come to depend on him in the fight against drugs, said Rep. Jack Barker, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman here, said the plane lost radar contact at 9:25. Lamar Breland told the Associated Press that my wife was preparing to go to bed, and we heard a plane coming over. In Miami, Jorge Prellezo, regional director of the National Transportation Safety Board, said a team of investigators had been dispatched to the scene. Investigators generally take months to establish a probable cause of such incidents. He was Harrison County Sheriff from 1984 to 1989, and was Gulfport police chief from 1977 to 1983. As sheriff, Smith coordinated anti-drug efforts of federal, local and state agencies across five states. Researcher Edith M. Stanley in Atlanta and staff writer Lori Silver in Washington contributed to this story.
