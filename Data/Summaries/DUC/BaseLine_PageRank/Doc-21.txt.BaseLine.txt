You can only wind the watch so tightly before it's going to snap. I think we're approaching that breaking point," said Van Hayden, 25, a student who says police beat him at the hotel. The city's police chief, John Laux, says there is no reason to assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present in all segments of society. "The whole society to different degrees has problems of racism," he said. Everyone always says, 'I can't believe this is happening in Minnesota, in Minneapolis, the home of progressiveness.' "There are bad apples in every bunch and the Minneapolis Police Department is no exception," said Councilwoman Sayles Belton. "I don't think they (the good officers) are pleased with the few that are giving them the bad rap _ the spoilers." Lloyd Smalley, 71, and Lillian Weiss, 65, were killed Jan. No one conducting the raid knew the elderly people were living there, said Laux. A grand jury decided not to bring charges against any officers, but an FBI investigation is continuing. Partygoers alleged that officers used the term "nigger," and beat some of those arrested. Laux said his officers have denied using racial names and said protesters lied about the number of people receiving medical attention following the arrests. Our goal is to find out who can offer that to us and in what form," said Laux.
