Beginning this summer, Torres and other health professionals will be offering nutrition and exercise classes geared toward Hispanics in an effort to educate them on the dangers of diabetes.; According to state Health Department statistics, the incidence of diabetes in the Hispanic population is three times that of the general population. Health experts believe the Hispanic diet and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors.; Our food is one of the richest in terms of taste and nutrition, said Torres. But it's the way we prepare the food that messes things up for us. ; In her classes, Torres said she will instruct her students to prepare tamales, refried beans and other traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil rather than the more traditional recipes that call for the use of lard.
