Waite, 51, an Anglican Church envoy, was kidnapped Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving his west Beirut hotel to negotiate with representatives of Anderson's kidnappers. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon. The staff sang "Happy birthday, Dear Terry" and blew out a candle on a white cake. "I beg you to release Terry and the others for humanitarian reasons. His daughter Gabrielle has matured from a child of 8 to a young woman of 14," she added. "Terry and myself would sit through those long nights and speak with great pain and remorse and longing for his daughter," Keenan said.
