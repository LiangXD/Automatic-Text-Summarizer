Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun. In the eastern town of Joensuu, a television news broadcast late Saturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzle falling. At that time, the moon will begin gradually moving between the Earth and the sun. About 10,000 people _ including 3,000 foreigners _ have converged on Joensuu, about 50 miles from the Soviet border. There conditions there are considered especially good for viewing the eclipse _ weather permitting. Ten months ago, Joensuu hired an "eclipse secretary" to handle arrangements for the expected influx of visitors. But that official, Marjut Cadia, said she had underestimated the interest in the event. Scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse, including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun. Seppo Linnaluoto of the Ursa Astronomical Association said the best place for observations of this eclipse will be the northeast Soviet Union.
