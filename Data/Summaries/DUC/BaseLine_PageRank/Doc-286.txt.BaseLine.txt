Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes, but it is most prevalent among minorities, especially Native Americans, blacks and Hispanics. More than 150,000 Americans die from diabetes each year; another 150,000 deaths are diabetes-related, according to the American Diabetes Association. No one really knows what sparks it, but researchers believe Hispanics could hold the key. San Antonio, the nation's ninth largest city, with a population that is 50 percent Hispanic, is becoming the base for diabetes studies. An epidemiologist at the center, Dr. Michael Stern, has devoted 10 years to studying Hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study of Type II diabetes. Type II, the most common form, develops mostly in obese adults over 40 who also may have a family history of the disease. In obese diabetics, the body has too much insulin because it is burning more fats than sugars. Stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics, fewer would get the disease. Teresa Castro, 54, whose diabetic husband died at age 37, went through the screening eight years ago. She was told that because of her weight, 254 pounds, she had hypertension and was at risk of diabetes. That's why I went to it, because being poor I couldn't afford to go to the doctor for this type of checkup," she said. "My mother has diabetes and they tell me I might have diabetes, too, but I don't know too much about it. That will include work for Lipha Chemicals, which makes an anti-diabetic drug called metaforim that improves the body's ability to respond to insulin. "The problem with Type II diabetics is not that they don't make enough insulin; they don't respond to the insulin," DeFronzo said.
