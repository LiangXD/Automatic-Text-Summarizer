Mad cow disease has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. I think everyone agrees that the risks are low, says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder. Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s. In the course of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and totally disoriented. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE. Ireland's Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of Northern Ireland. David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of BSE hysteria in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is remote. A commission chaired by Sir Richard Southwood, a professor at Oxford University, reported last year that the cause of BSE is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses. The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a shrewd guess that BSE is transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.
