As Hurricane Gilbert's record-breaking fury sends Caribbean islanders scrambling for cover, National Hurricane Center Director Bob Sheets remained calm at his helm. EDT Tuesday night, making Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere in terms of barometric pressure, but Sheets handled a mob of reporters with ease. Rosy-cheeked and good-natured, Sheets was named acting director during the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season and became director in March. "He knows his job very well and he's a calm personality," Vivian Jorge, the center's budget analyst, said of Sheets. On days with especially active tropical weather, Ms. Jorge steps in to coordinate media interviews. The major television networks, local stations and print media were on hand to monitor the hurricane. "You feel a lot more confident about what you're doing than with weaker systems." His previous experience with hurricanes has served him well in keeping off the pressure during these sometimes 18-hour days.
