The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, has been the prime mover for action against the UK. A series of restrictions have been imposed in the UK beef sector, which Britain and the commission say are working.
