That lower figure would result in the loss of an estimated $56 million a year in federal revenue, they said. Such exclusions, the letter said, could result in the county losing representatives in Congress because districts are determined by population. Just Thursday, efforts to include illegal aliens in the Census received a major boost when negotiators from the U.S. Senate and House agreed on the issue. Before Thursday's action, the Senate had voted to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens, although the House had twice rejected efforts to exclude aliens. If those residents had been included, it could have meant another $2.2 million in state and federal revenue, according to city officials.
