Hundreds of small grass and brush fires were reported over the July 4 weekend, some caused by fireworks, in various parts of the country. Ray Wood, regional ranger for the New York Department of Environmental Conservation in the Hudson Valley. In California, a fireworks-caused blaze that swept over 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park was declared contained at dawn Tuesday. "We have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket," said Mary Hale, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry. By Monday, $384,000 had been spent to combat the fire, she said. Authorities will try to recover that money, said Pat Kaunert of the U.S. Forest Service. More than 670 firefighters from federal, state and local agencies cut trails in the rugged terrain by hand and used airplanes to drop fire retardant, officials said. In Utah, Chief Ranger Bob Andrew said the Zion blaze was ignited by lightning June 19. Weekend rain helped keep it from spreading outside the wilderness boundary, said fire information Officer Jo Barnier in Billings. Rain Monday night also calmed three fires in Yellowstone National Park in the state's northwest corner. In Michigan, authorities concluded a hot exhaust pipe or exhaust particles triggered the Upper Peninsula fire, said Mary Mumford, spokeswoman for Hiawatha National Forest. Firefighters also battled two smaller fires that broke out on the Upper Peninsula Tuesday, burning 220 acres, Department of Natural Resources spokesman Bob Heyd said.
