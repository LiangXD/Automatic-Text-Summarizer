The Navy cutter Vigilant escorted the 465-foot ship, the Scandinavian Star, as a precaution, according to Chief Petty Officer Luis Diaz of the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami. "The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the Mexican navy to Cancun," said Diaz. There were no injuries from the fire, but a 71-year-old St. Petersburg man who suffered a heart attack was in stable condition and on his way home aboard a Coast Guard plane. The 449 passengers will be flown to St. Petersburg, said Jill DeChello, spokesman for the ship's owner, SeaEscape Ltd. of Miami. The Scandinavian Star was on a 3-day cruise to Cozumel, Mexico, and was returning to St. Petersburg when the fire broke out about 1 a.m. "I feel they are two totally different incidents that are in no way related," said Ms. DeChello.
