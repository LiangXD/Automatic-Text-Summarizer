PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within the next 10 days to reform the US social safety net of welfare programmes. 'The bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and the right support systems,' Mr Clinton said. These suspicions were enhanced when Ms Donna Shalala, new secretary of health and human services, last month devoted only one sentence to welfare reform in a five-page statement of goals. With the onset of the recession, state revenues have been constrained while the number of welfare recipients has grown by 30 per cent.
