But on the flight from South Korea, he denied using the drugs even though Olympic officials said the results were indisputable. "I got nothing to hide," Johnson told The Boston Globe during the flight to New York, where he then boarded another plane for Canada. "There's no gold now, just disappointment," said Boyd Plaxton, 26, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, one of 200 people on hand when Johnson's plane landed. Chaos spoiled a gilt-edged moment for a man who had run 100 meters in the fastest time ever, 9.79 seconds. Johnson, surrounded by a phalanx of security guards, ducked into a car and made a mad dash for the door when he arrived at the house. On the way to New York, however, he stayed in the passenger cabin, appearing calm throughout the flight, the Globe said. "First I was shocked, but after a while, I don't care," Johnson said when asked what he felt after he was informed he had failed the drug test. Sports Minister Jean Charest said Johnson had tested negative for drugs in August and had passed eight tests in two years. Johnson's family and close friends also denied he took steroids "I know my son doesn't take drugs. I know it," said his father, Ben Johnson Sr., from Falmouth, Jamaica, in an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail. "Ben loved mom too much to discredit her in any way," said his sister, Claire Rodney, of suburban Toronto. It was surrendered to Canadian Olympic officials before the family left South Korea on Monday. He wants to be with people who love him now, not the hypocrites who abandoned him," Ms. Rodney said outside her mother's house. His personal physician, Dr. George Astaphan, also said no steroids were dispensed.
