CHINA stepped up the war of words over the future of Hong Kong yesterday, threatening to ignore the results of democratic elections proposed by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, once it assumes control in 1997. Mr Lu also added his voice to personal criticism of the governor, saying that he would be condemned by history over his handling of the Hong Kong issue. Speaking at a Beijing press conference, he left the door open, however, for further contacts with Britain, saying that China 'always stands for co-operation, and not confrontation'. An official added: 'The only sensible way forward is for the two sides to sit down and discuss without preconditions the points of difference between us.' The Hang Seng index was some 200 points down before Mr Lu's press conference, but recovered most of its losses to close at 5,958.33, down 21.7 on the day. We have to do this because the kitchen started by Mr Chris Patten before 1997 will not converge with the stipulations of the Basic Law after 1997.'
