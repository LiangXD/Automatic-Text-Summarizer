MR HARRY Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and De Beers, is to visit Russia next week at a time when the republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamond industry. His visit also comes at a time when the beleaguered diamond industry is rife with rumours about unofficial exports from Russia contributing to the present market turmoil which might force De Beers to cut its dividend payment this year. 'It appears to be another sign that the former De Beers' chairman is taking a more active role in guiding the company through its current difficulties,' says the Diamantaire newsletter today. De Beers said yesterday that the visit by Mr Oppenheimer, accompanied by his son Nicholas, was a private one originally arranged for August last year but postponed because of the coup d'etat in the former Soviet Union. De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, in 1990 signed a Dollars 5bn, five-year sales contract with the former Soviet Union and at the same time advanced a loan of Dollars 1bn. These proposals are being opposed by the Yakut government, which is backing a joint-stock company, Almazy Rossli (Diamonds of Russia), being set up with Mr Valery Rudakov, formerly in charge of Rosalmazzoloto, at its head. Observers expect Mr Oppenheimer to bring his formidable negotiating skills to bear to ensure that De Beers grip on the diamond market is in no way weakened by any changes in Russia.
