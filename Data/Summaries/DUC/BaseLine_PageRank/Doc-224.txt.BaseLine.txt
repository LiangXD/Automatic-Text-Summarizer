The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa's giant De Beers diamond organization. Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa. The British government is expected to rule in the next few weeks whether to allow Minorco to proceed with its 2.9 billion-pound (about $5.1 billion) bid for Consolidated Gold following an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. De Beers' Central Selling Organization, which controls 80 percent of world diamond trading, has been based in London for 60 years.
