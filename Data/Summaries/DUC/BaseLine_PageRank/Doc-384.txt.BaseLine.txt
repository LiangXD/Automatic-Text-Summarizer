"They have been useless and give misleading information," said Leonard Saxe, a visiting professor of psychology at Brandeis University and a leading opponent of polygraph testing. Last week, the state Supreme Court banned lie detector tests from being introduced as evidence in criminal trials. Massachusetts had been one of the last remaining states that gave defendants the right to use polygraphs to support their alibis. The court was not alone in deciding against polygraphs, which attempt to determine someone's honesty by their physiological response to certain questions. Last year, Congress prohibited most private sector employers from using lie dectectors to screen job applicants or randomly test workers. He declined to give specific numbers, but he said the drop was "about as sharp as you can get." Buckley said his group had about 3,000 members a year ago, but the number has dropped by a third. "A lot of them had to change careers," he said. Law enforcement agencies use lie detectors to interview witnesses when investigating crimes. Timothy Cornish, a prosecutor in the New Mexico attorney general's office, called polygraph exams "witchcraft." "It can, if used in an unbridled way, change the entire truth-seeking process," he said. "Every piece of evidence has a dose of uncertainty," Raskin said.
