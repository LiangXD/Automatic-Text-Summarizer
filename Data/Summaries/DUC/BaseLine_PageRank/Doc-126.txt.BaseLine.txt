According to Mr. Gartner, this year about 3,000 teen-agers... will use handguns to kill themselves. Suicides are, without doubt, tragic events affecting parents, families and society. Is how these people killed themselves the real issue, or is why more important? The reason Washington has yet to enact serious gun-control laws is due to the enormous voting and financial pressure of the pro-gun lobby. While Congress is congratulating itself on how well it acted during the vote on the Persian Gulf war, more than 100 body bags were filled here in the U.S. due to handgun violence. The NRA has not acted prudently and is alienating the support and respect of many legislators, police departments and its members. James Forbes Atlanta --- It is refreshing to read the actual motives of those who claim they simply want a waiting period for the purchase of a handgun. Mr. Gartner has now made it abundantly clear that his goal is the elimination of handguns from our society. Richard W. Bonds Cordova, Tenn. --- Mr. Gartner should have read The Federalist No. Furthermore, Madison makes it clear that state militias, by the fact of their being organized, would give private arms their greatest effectiveness in the resistance to tyranny. Thus the well-organized militia phrase in the Second Amendment was not intended to restrict arms to those in the militia -- as the anti-gun lobby would have us believe.
