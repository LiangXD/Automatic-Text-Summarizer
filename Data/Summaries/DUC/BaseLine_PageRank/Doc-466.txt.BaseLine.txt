Men who smoke heavily are nearly twice as likely as nonsmokers to die from a common form of leukemia, concludes a report by the University of Edinburgh. The analysis, based on a previous study of 248,046 U.S. veterans, offers the firmest link yet between cigarette consumption and the disease. The earlier study tallied overall deaths from various causes, including 723 deaths due to leukemia. These heavy smokers had a 93% greater chance of developing fatal leukemia than the veterans who never had smoked. And men using fewer than 10 cigarettes daily were 31% more likely to die from leukemia than nonsmokers, according to the report. Previous studies have observed higher death rates from leukemia among smokers, but either involved fewer patients or didn't compare amounts smoked with incidence of the disease.
