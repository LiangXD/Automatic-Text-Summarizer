Rowley said other Western states also are experiencing drought, which means they won't be able to send us the firefighting forces they normally can deploy out here.... Los Angeles, which has an annual average of 14.93 inches of rainfall, has received 6.18 inches so far this season, promising to make this the driest season in 30 years. The rainfall season, which runs from July 1 to June 30, is almost over for 1989-90, and Southern California seldom gets much measurable rain in late May and the month of June. Rowley said the long drought has weakened the vegetation in Southern California, making it more vulnerable to disease and infestation by pests. He said that with normal rainfall, pine trees are vigorous enough to fight off bark beetles, which bore into trunks and limbs to lay their eggs. But during the current dry spell, the trees haven't been able to produce enough sap to rid themselves of the beetles. The fungus, first observed about eight years ago, attacks broad-leafed plants such as mountain lilac, manzanita and sumac, some of the more fire-resistant species of brush. Officials said large patches of this dead and dying brush now mottle the hillsides, ready to burst into flame at the slightest spark. Fire officials generally have responded to the threat with increased training and requests for federal money to pay for extra firefighting personnel. Especially threatened suburban communities include portions of Rolling Hills, Rancho Palos Verdes, Beverly Hills, Glendale, Pasadena, Altadena, Arcadia, Monrovia, Bradbury, Duarte, Azusa, Glendora, Claremont and Whittier. FIRE STRESS AREAS Map shows largely undeveloped land where dead brush and a lack of leaf moisture in live brush create high fire hazards. Fire officials say these are areas where blazes can start and expand rapidly, spreading from open land to homes and other structures. Do not not store firewood, trash or other combustibles within 30 feet of any building.
