People caught by Hurricane Hugo last year might disagree, but forecasters here say the deadly storm may have had a positive side effect _ it got the public's attention. Hugo, which caused an unprecedented $10 billion in damage, killed 28 people in the Lesser Antilles islands and an additional 29 in South Carolina. But it would have been much more deadly if it had hit almost anywhere else, says Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center. 30, Sheets and other hurricane experts are using Hugo's example to get the attention of complacent coastal residents who've never experienced such fury. "We'll take advantage of the fact that there was a Hugo last year and raise people's awareness," said Sheets. It heavily damaged the fishing village of McClellanville and several small rural communities, but the population there is sparse. "Compare that situation to the Miami-through-Palm Beach area _ all of Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties would have been... destroyed." Since then, the population of areas such as south Florida has ballooned and most residents have never directly experienced a hurricane. Gray came to this conclusion after his usually accurate predictions for hurricane activity were off the mark last year. Gray realized the 30-year drought in Africa's Sahel region corresponds almost exactly to the years when no major hurricanes have struck the southeastern coast.
