(These volcanoes -- including Mount Lassen in the Sierra Nevada, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in the Cascade Range -- arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.); Pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980. That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.; Risk to planes; Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base, Lipman said.; Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash -- indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their engines stalled by the grit.; So far, the winds have blown ash away from the base. But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash directly toward the base.; The volcano's activity -- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, Lipman said.; The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside.
