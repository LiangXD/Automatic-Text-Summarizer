The "statement of solidarity with Anderson" is from "the leading freedom of expression organizations in the Western world," Anne Nelson, executive director of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, said Monday. Ms. Nelson said she also will read the statement Thursday at the National Press Club in Washington during a news conference announcing her group's "annual attacks-on-the-press report." "We call on President Bush and Vice President Quayle to use every possible means at their disposal to bring Terry Anderson and the other hostages home," Ms. Nelson said. In London, IFJ Secretary General Aidan White will be accompanied by McCarthy's girlfriend, Gill Morell, and several trade union leaders when they meet with U.S. Embassy officials.
