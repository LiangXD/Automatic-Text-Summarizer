To justify seizing Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., regulators arbitrarily wrote down the value of its $1.4-billion loan portfolio as 50% less and slashed the worth of its extensive land, hotel and stock holdings by 75%, the thrift's former owner said Wednesday. Reading from a Federal Home Loan Bank Board analysis of Lincoln's loan and equity portfolios prepared a week after the government imposed a conservatorship April 14, 1989, Keating called the numbers absurd. The document estimated that the thrift's assets were worth only $2 billion to $2.5 billion, or $1.85 billion to $2.2 billion less than what they were listed on Lincoln's books at the time. For nearly a year, Keating has asserted that he ran Lincoln soundly, and that regulators could show the thrift was insolvent only by placing a lower value on its assets. Comparing the figures from the regulators' analysis with those provided by American Continental's chief financial officer, he testified Wednesday that only 3% of Lincoln's $1.4-billion mortage-loan portfolio was more than 60 days in default. Robert Wurzelbacher, Keating's son-in-law who headed Lincoln's real estate investments, likened the analysis to a family buying a $100,000 home with a $20,000 down payment and an $80,000 loan. It wasn't until August that the regulators asserted that Lincoln's alleged losses actually exceeded the value of its assets and imposed a receivership that took ownership of the thrift from Keating.
