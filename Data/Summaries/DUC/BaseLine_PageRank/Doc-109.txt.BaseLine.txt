Actress Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized with pneumonia, was listed as stable Thursday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, her publicist said. We have nothing else," said Lisa Del Favaro, a Taylor spokeswoman with Chen Sam and Associates public relations in New York City. "She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized," Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist treating Miss Taylor, said in a statement Tuesday. The actress had a nearly fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, the year she won an Oscar for "Butterfield 8."
