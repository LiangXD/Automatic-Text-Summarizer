Although 16 nations fly flags in Antarctica, and seven claim slices of it, no one holds title. In Paris, bginning Monday, 39 nations will review the 1959 Antarctic Treaty that expires in 1991. They also will examine the remains of the Antarctic Minerals Convention, signed in May 1988. The convention would have allowed controlled mining and oil exploration, replacing a voluntary moratorium. But Australia, one of seven claimant nations with a veto, decided not to ratify it. The United States, the Soviet Union and Japan, among others, are pressing for a minerals accord. France, echoing Australia's concerns, wants Antarctica to be an unspoiled world park. Detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitably pollutes a reserve crucial to man's survival. Upsetting its delicate balance, they say, will have consequences no one can predict. Scientists worry that tourists, whose numbers now approach 10,000 a year, endanger fragile ecosystems. Huge ice floes menace ships' hulls, adding a threat of oil pollution. Penguin colonies, like rush-hour crowds dressed in black tie, amuse scientists who try to take them seriously. Human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birds and marine mammals, scientists say. In Antarctica, with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds, accidents are common. Once damage is done, experience shows, it is very difficult to correct.
