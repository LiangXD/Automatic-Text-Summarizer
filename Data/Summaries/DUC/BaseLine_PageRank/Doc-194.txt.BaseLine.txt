With a third presidential candidate assassinated, Colombia's government refused Friday to put off next month's election and vowed to keep up the fight against drug traffickers. That is not the first time there have been contradictory communiques, verbal and faxed, claiming and and then denying responsibility for assassinations and terrorist acts. Since then, drug traffickers have killed more than 230 people, including judges, politicians, policemen, soldiers, newspaper employees and two other presidential candidates. But Interior Minister Horacio Serpa told reporters Friday that the elections will not be postponed or canceled. On Friday, thousands of men, women and children filed past Pizarro's coffin, displayed in an open patio in the Congress building. Supporters of Pizarro's M-19 movement burned buses and threw rocks at police in clashes in several cities. Hundreds of leftist guerrillas belonging to the M-19 rebel group laid down their arms last month and formed a political party with Pizarro as its presidential candidate. Government officials had said Pizarro could have helped mediate peace agreements with other leftist insurgents. Governing party candidate Cesar Gaviria, the presidential front-runner, suspended campaign activities following the Pizarro killing. The other candidates are Alvaro Gomez Hurtado and Rodrigo Lloreda, both of the Conservative Party. The Patriotic Union's presidential candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo, was fatally wounded March 22 at the Bogota airport by an assassin with a machine gun. Minutes later, he stood up, pulled the weapon from his black leather jacket, leaned forward and fired at Pizarro's head from about a foot away, Munevar said.
