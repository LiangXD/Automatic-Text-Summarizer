Wazir was slain April 16 during a raid on his house near Tunis, Tunisia. Israeli officials who spoke on condition they not be identified said an Israeli squad carried out the assassination. There have been accusations by the PLO that the United States knew about and approved plans for slaying Wazir. In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy denied Arafat's accusation that the United States threatened PLO officials. He said security also was being augmented at PLO offices around the Arab world following the alleged threat. The document, which was typewritten in English, referred to Wazir by his code name, Abu Jihad. It read: "You may be aware of charges in several Middle Eastern and particulary Palestinian circles that the U.S. knew of and approved Abu Jihad's assassination. "Any possible targeting of American personnel and facilities in retaliation for Abu Jihad's assassination would be totally reprehensible and unjustified.
