A recent FAO/World Food Programme crop assessment mission blamed the crop failure on erratic and insufficient rainfall. The mission estimated about 493,000 tons of cereals would have to be imported. Another 270,000 tons would be required to be sold in the market to stabilise food supply and prices. We attach equal importance to keeping the commercial sector well-supplied, said WFP Director Phillip Ostenso. Studies suggest more than half of rural pre-school children suffer from chronic malnutrition.
