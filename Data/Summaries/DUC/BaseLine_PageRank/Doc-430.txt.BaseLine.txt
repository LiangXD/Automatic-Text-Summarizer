Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr., his family and his business empire poured nearly $350,000 into state politics during 1985 and 1986, with about half of it going to Gov. He also invested heavily in a San Diego company controlled by Stickel, who also was a Deukmejian fund raiser and became the Republican Party's finance co-chairman in 1987. In April, Keating's American Continental Corp. of Phoenix filed for bankruptcy, prompting federal officials to immediately take over its subsidiary Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. After the seizure, the outspoken Keating candidly declared that he had expected the political contributions to prod influential politicians, such as U.S. Sen. One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause, said Keating. As attorneys, he hired fund raiser Samuelian and Franklin Tom, a former state commissioner of savings and loan who left public service to join Samuelian's Los Angeles law firm. In January, 1985, when Taggart joined TCS, Keating hired him as an executive and paid $2.89 million to buy 19.2% of the fledgling San Diego firm's stock as it went public. While Keating himself gave only $7,000 -- all of it to Deukmejian -- the coalition of his relatives, business interests and associates brought total donations to $349,500 in 1985 and 1986. They gave $7,500 to the California Republican Party, $50,000 to the League of Conservative Voters, $17,000 to then-Assemblyman Davis' campaign for state controller, and $85,000 to the state Democratic Party. EARLY WARNING -- A key federal regulator told top government officials nearly a year before the collapse of Lincoln S&amp;L that their efforts to control the Irvine thrift would be unsuccessful.
