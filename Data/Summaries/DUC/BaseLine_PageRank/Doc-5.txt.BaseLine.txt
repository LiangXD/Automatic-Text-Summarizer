THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiform encephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope population, the government has admitted. In all, six species other than cattle have been confirmed with the condition during this period. A total of 894 cases of sheep encephalopathies or 'scrapie' were diagnosed in 1991, versus just 348 a year-earlier.
