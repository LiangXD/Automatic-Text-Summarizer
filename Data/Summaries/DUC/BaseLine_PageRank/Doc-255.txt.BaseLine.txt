The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot, dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic states. Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts along the U.S.-Canadian border, possibly triggering scattered showers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley. In addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. And a separate climate assessment added that many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months. At the beginning of July, 29 percent of the nation was undergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said. The drought region now extends well into West Virginia and includes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky and Tennessee, the weather service drought advisory said. The drought has been accompanied by higher than normal temperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western Great Lakes region.
