Such droughts could be anticipated if the temperature abnormalities turn out to be predictable, one of the authors said in the report appearing in Friday's issue of Science magazine. "Such an answer is, however, just a brief description of the weather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at the cause. Their proposed answer focuses on the development in April, May and June of drought in the Midwest, where several states recorded less rain than at any time since 1895. By July the weather pattern they studied was breaking up, and continuing dryness in the study area and elsewhere probably had other causes, Arkin said. The global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of a more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these abnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought, he said. The authors took note of computer models predicting increased frequency of drought with the buildup of the "greenhouse effect" global warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
