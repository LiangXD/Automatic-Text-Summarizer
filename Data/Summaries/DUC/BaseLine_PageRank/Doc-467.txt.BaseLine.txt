The death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among non-smokers, according to a study published Friday. They wrote that it was "the largest study of leukemia and smoking habits to date (and) represents additional evidence that leukemia is a smoking-related disease." In an editorial in the prestigious weekly, Professor Nicholas Wald of St. Bartholemew's Hospital in London cautioned that no cause-and-effect relationship had been established. But he added: "Whatever the mechanism, the balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia." It should therefore be added to the World Heath Organization's list of tobacco-related causes of death, he wrote. The study was conducted on data collected from 248,000 veterans between 1954 and 1969, the researchers wrote.
