They're going to begin dying like bloody flies, said Ed Rist, head of CARE's East Africa unit. I don't think we've seen anything quite like this. ; Even as Africa slips into what could become the worst human disaster in its history, there is debate about whether the United States should aggressively intervene or offer assistance with political conditions attached.; And a spate of disasters worldwide is sending attention and humanitarian aid elsewhere.; In Latin America, more than 160,000 cholera cases have been reported, including 1,203 deaths. On the Turkey-Iraq border, thousands of Kurdish families still bury their dead and struggle to survive.; In Bangladesh, rescue workers continue to find drowned babies lashed to uprooted trees, tied on by parents who wanted to protect their young from the cyclone that devastated the country.; Interest in a disaster is contingent on media coverage, said Alex deWaal, associate director of London-based Africa Watch. Several African governments, including Sudan, have been accused in the past of doing just that.; Human rights violations outlined in reports by Africa Watch and Amnesty International have led some people to suggest that the United States and United Nations should attach conditions to humanitarian aid.
