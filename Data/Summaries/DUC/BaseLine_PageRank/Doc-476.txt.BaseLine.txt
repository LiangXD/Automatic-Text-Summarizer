Supporters of the increase argue that a major impetus has been recent boosts in many state minimum-wage levels. Certain occupations, including casual babysitters and most farm workers, are excluded as well as employees of small businesses and firms not engaged in interstate commerce. At the same time, if a state's minimum is higher than the federal minimum, the state minimum applies. Furthermore, the District of Columbia, like many states, has a subminimum, or training wage, of $3.35 for employees in some job categories who are under age 18. (Some states also have subminimums based on age, student status, approved internship programs or for new hires.) Yet the different minimum-wage levels to a large extent reflect regional variations in levels of unemployment and labor demand, as well as costs of living. Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living. California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages. Compare these unemployment rates to those of Alabama and Louisiana, states that have no minimum wage. As Robert Martin of the Chamber of Commerce has pointed out: Most states recognize that what you pay someone is determined by supply and demand.
