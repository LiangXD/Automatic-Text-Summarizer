Police said members of Shining Path, a Maoist group, killed two policemen and wounded three in jungle raids. Escobar is investigating charges that troops rounded up dozens of peasants, accused them of being Shining Path members and killed them. The government says more than 15,000 people have been killed and puts the property damage at $10 billion.
