St. Martin's, 306 pp., $18.95; CHARLIE Francis, testifying in 1988 in Toronto at a federal inquiry about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports, seemed a mad scientist, something on the order of Dr. Frankenstein. 24, 1988, Francis' most famous pupil, Ben Johnson, who immigrated to Toronto from Jamaica as a scrawny 14-year-old, ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds at the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. About 42 hours after my life's greatest moment, Francis writes on the first page of his confessional, Speed Trap, his nightmare began. ; Johnson, the world's fastest man, had tested positive for illegal steroid use. Millions of dollars worth of endorsements shriveled up. His gold medal was revoked, and his world record was, too.; Because Johnson was caught, the Canadians were embarrassed. Because they were embarrassed, they conducted a federal inquiry. The desire for speed comes with incredible costs, and they are the trap. We learn that Johnson harmed his own world-record times by raising his hand jubilantly as he approached the finish line. That's one of Francis' theories for why Johnson got caught.; But, Francis says, there is no logical reason for Johnson to have been caught. No one of Johnson's standing had been caught before. Francis, without naming names, convinces us that steroid usage is rampant, but he tells us what that means to him only in a technical sense. It does not take any moral stand; it lacks passion. We ceased being natural ages ago, the moment we stopped running barefoot on dirt paths, Francis writes.
