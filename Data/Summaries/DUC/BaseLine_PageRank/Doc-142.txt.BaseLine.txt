The figure, contained in the bank's annual report and made public before its annual meeting here Sept. 23, was almost a third larger than in 1987, when the net pay-back totaled $38.3 billion. The cash drain has been growing steadily since 1984, when it was $10.2 billion. However, actual disbursements of loan money are expected to remain at about $11 billion. Sunday's total is approximately $7 billion higher than a preliminary estimate of $43 billion for 1988 that the bank published last December. And the new U.S. plan to help countries reduce their debts is expected to trim the total some. The debt service for this total -- that is, the payments to cover interest and principal -- amounts to about $143 billion a year. But others, such as those in Latin America, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, that are heavily state-owned economies and consume more than they produce, have not.
