The nation's top military officer jumped into the Pentagon budget battle Friday, arguing that hasty cuts in military spending will end up "breaking the back" of America's defense. Powell's blunt remarks were his first major commentary on the debate over spending for the nation's military arsenal at a time of lessened East-West tensions. A former national security adviser, Powell now serves as the president's primary military counselor and coordinator of the nations' military leaders. The four-star general said that although Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev remains "very much in charge," his policies "are sowing the seed of his own weakness." "So even as we reduce, we must maintain our ability to deter and defend," he said. But the general also defended President Bush's $303.3 billion spending plan for fiscal 1991 as "a realistic, prudent response" to the changing world. The administration budget blueprint, Powell said, will begin to reduce the nation's forces over time. But if Bush's budget request is cut back significantly, "You will force us to start breaking the back of our armed forces," he said. The general also took aim at lawmakers who are seeking more severe cuts over a shorter period of time.
