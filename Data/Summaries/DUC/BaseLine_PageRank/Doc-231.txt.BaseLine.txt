Jwaneng's position is being reinforced by a USDollars 160m expansion programme at present being completed three months ahead of schedule and under budget. Meanwhile, 160km west of Kimberley in the northern Cape Province of South Africa, another diamond mine, the Finsch, where operations started in 1964, has been given a new lease of life. Having dug an open pit 423 metres deep, miners have now gone underground. Mr Simon Webb, the general manager, says that the underground development has given it another 35 to 40 years of life. It also remains intent on maintaining its diamond output even though its 100-year-old mines at Kimberley are now running down. No wonder Jwaneng's company slogan is Re phtas imisa Botswana, which translates as 'We make Botswana sparkle'. Now a so-called fourth stream is being completed which is adding one-third to processing capacity. Mr Loz Shaw, chief geologist, says drilling down to 600 metres shows there are still plenty of diamonds at that depth and so the pit will go down at least that far. Mr Derrick Moore, the general manager, says this indicates mining in the open pit will last another 35 years - 'and then we might go underground'. However, Mr Mark Button, mining superintendent, says: 'Finsch has come of age as an underground mine after two years. Among the innovations that have helped Finsch achieve its objectives are some remote-controlled LHD (load-haul-dump) trucks which are similar to radio-controlled toy vehicles or boats.
