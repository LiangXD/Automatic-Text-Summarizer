Plans announced by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian to build a 5,000-room resort here would allow Las Vegas to claim the eight largest hotels in the world by 1992, according to industry statistics. Of course, Las Vegas' domination of the list dpends on other cities not building big hotels between now and 1992. The Flamingo will hold the title only a few months, until the Excalibur opens next summer with 4,032 rooms. Circus Circus, the parent corporation for Excalibur, currently has 2,800 rooms in Las Vegas, as does Bally's Hotel on the Strip.
