President Bush has just nominated him to the Supreme Court. Few Americans much notice that Saddam Hussein of Iraq is accusing his small neighbors of harboring an "imperial-Zionist plan" to drive down the price of oil. The oil glut was the problem for Saddam Hussein of Iraq. After eight years of war with Iran, ended by a cease-fire, his country was powerful but broke. Saddam found a pair of villains _ Kuwait, his wartime supporter and financier, and the United Arab Emirates. Oil was bringing $14 a barrel, 20 percent lower than the year before. That was the background to the events that brought out the battleships, the troops _ and the gas masks. He wants Kuwait to forgive $15 billion in loans extended during the Iran-Iraq war. Oh, God Almighty, be witness that we have warned them." In Washington, the House and Senate defy Bush administration opposition and vote for economic sanctions against Iraq. The State Department says the votes will not be helpful to diplomatic efforts to modify Saddam's behavior. But two hours later, they break off. The Iraqi delegation walks out, saying they did not sense "any seriousness" from the Kuwaitis. 1) _ Tank-led Iraqi infantry units storm into Kuwait. They advance unchecked down a highway across the flat desert terrain to the capital, Kuwait city. The Financial Times says the advance is so unchallenged that some troops travelled down the road by bus. Kuwait's hopelessly outnumbered troops wage pitched battles around the sheik's residential palace. The sheik's younger brother is reported to have been killed defending the palace. Kuwait's crown prince and premier, Sheik Saad al-Abdallah Al Sabah, goes on the radio and television and calls for resistance: "Let them taste the chalice of death." Finally, he commits massive American force, the largest dispatched since the Vietnam war, to protect Saudi Arabia from Kuwait's fate. He says they will serve until Saddam withdraws from Kuwait.
