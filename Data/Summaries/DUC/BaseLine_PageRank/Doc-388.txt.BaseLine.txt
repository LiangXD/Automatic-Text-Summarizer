The association is made up mostly of men who served on the two ships of that name during World War II. "If the captain had stayed there and not done anything, we might have been reading about loss of life on the Vincennes," Brroks said. The Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iran Air jet shot down was a commercial Airbus carrying 290 people from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas to Dubai. The two U.S. missiles were fired by USS Vincennes, an Aegis class cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles. Association member Gene Thurmond, 65, of Evansville, served on the second USS Vincennes, a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and sunk by Japanese cruisers in 1942. A light cruiser named for Vincennes was commissioned in 1944 and received six battle stars for service in World War II before it was decommissioned in September 1946. "I met the skipper last summer and he's a real captain and level-headed and I think he did the proper thing," he said. "There's no way of rectifying this kind of situation, so all we can do is remember these people," Toth said. "From what I've heard about the ship, it's like everybody on it is family and they're trying to be the best in the Navy," Toth said.
