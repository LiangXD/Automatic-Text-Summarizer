Thousands of peole prayed, cheered, danced, beat drums and observed other traditions today as a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of Indonesia and the southern Philippines. Clouds obscured the solar spectacular in Jakarta, Indonesia, Hong Kong and in the eastern Mindanao city of Davao, where thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe the eclipse. But it was visible for about 3 minutes in this city about 650 miles southeast of Manila despite early scattered clouds. Richard Fisher of the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colo., said that despite scattered clouds, scientists were confident they had taken useful pictures of the eclipse. Hymns were chanted and conch shells blown during the ceremony about 90 miles north of New Delhi. But the cloud cover broke, setting off wild cheering among the thousands who watched the phenomenon in a scorching tropical heat. According to local superstition, babies conceived during or shortly before an eclipse will be deformed unless their mothers practice the ritual. "This phenomenon is a clear reminder from God for mankind to repent its sins," said Theresa Teopengco, a government employee. But in Davao City, 60 miles to the northeast, morning clouds sent hundreds scurrying to the airport for flights to General Santos. Church bells in Davao tolled while police and civilians set off firecrackers and fired weapons in the air to mark the eclipse.
