But what isn't clear is whether loyal ex-colleagues will follow the Pied Piper of junk bonds to his new firm _ and how long the venture will last with Milken facing a lengthy jail term. Milken, 42, resigned Thursday after 19 years at Drexel, where he began a wildly successful career that helped reshape corporate America in the 1980s through the pioneering use of low-grade securities called junk bonds. But Milken still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junk bond employees and Drexel clients, and no one is ruling out defections. A Drexel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Wall Street giant does not anticipate conflicts with Milken's new firm because it will not be in the brokerage business. Under Drexel's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider trading and other fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Drexel and its employees are barred from doing business with Milken, directly or indirectly. For instance, Milken may be able to refer clients to Drexel and vice versa but not receive any fees. Milken's resignation ends the relationship between one of the most important financial players of the decade and the firm he helped boost from a second-tier brokerage to the nation's fifth largest. "Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad event," Drexel stated. His brother, Lowell, who also was charged in the case, announced Thursday he was quitting the firm to return to practicing law. By quitting, Milken pre-empts the firm's agreement with the SEC to dismiss him once the settlement is approved by a federal judge.
