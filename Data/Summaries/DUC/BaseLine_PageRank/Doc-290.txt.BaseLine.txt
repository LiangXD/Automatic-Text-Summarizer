It just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area," Allen said. He noted that the 1988 report, titled "Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault," presented information that was already widely known among scientists. Allen said this information should have alerted officials to take preventive steps. Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale. It was centered in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico. Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday's quake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings. It's something we should therefore be ready for," Allen said.
