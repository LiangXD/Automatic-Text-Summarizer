HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water.
