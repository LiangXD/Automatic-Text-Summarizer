Firefighters in California, Michigan, Montana, Wyoming and Utah battled holiday weekend fires which blackened more than 6,000 acres of forest and wilderness areas. Illegal fireworks were blamed for a blaze that swept over 2,200 rugged acres of Stanislaus National Forest in California, 10 miles west of Yosemite National Park. The fire, which began Saturday, was declared contained this morning, "We have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket," said Mary Hale, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry. In southern Utah's scenic Zion National Park, firefighters tried today to contain a 600-acre fire that was ignited by lightning June 19 but had been allowed to burn in a small area. However, on Sunday, winds ranging from 30 mph to 60 mph fanned the flames out of control, Chief Ranger Bob Andrew said. U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dale Bluedorn agreed, but said they will continue to keep patrolling. "It may not be declared out until there's a three-day rain," he said Monday. Fire information officer Dave Damron said water was also being pumped out of bogs in the Shoshone forest to help contain the fire.
