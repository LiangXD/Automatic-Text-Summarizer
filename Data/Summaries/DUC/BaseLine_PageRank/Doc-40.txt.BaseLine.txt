It's maybe the greatest natural occurrence one can witness, said Larry Toy, a Chabot College astronomy professor. The phenomenon is just awe-inspiring. ; Solar eclipses occur twice a year, when the sun, moon and earth line up. (This line-up would occur at every new moon, except that the moon's orbit is tilted so it only crosses the sun's path every six months.); Because of variations in the moon's orbit, fewer than a third of the solar eclipses are total eclipses. In these cases the moon's shadow, up to 200 miles wide on the earth's surface, races west to east along the ground at 1,000 to 5,000 miles per hour for a few thousand miles.; Most total eclipses get little public attention.
