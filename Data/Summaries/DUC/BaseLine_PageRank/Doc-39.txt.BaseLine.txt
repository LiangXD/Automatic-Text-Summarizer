This will also be the longest-lasting total eclipse until 2132, according to Alan Dyer, an associate editor at Astronomy magazine.; The midday eclipse will consist of a 160-mile wide lunar shadow speeding at up to 5,000 miles per hour along the Earth's surface.; While many Mexicans are looking forward to the event, some are quietly taking precautions. In pre-Colombian times, eclipses were viewed as bad omens by the sun-worshiping Aztecs.; In the capital's Sonora market, specializing in magic, vendors have stocked up on garlic bulbs tied with red ribbon, which they hawk as protection from the bad vibrations of the eclipse. A thriving trade is also taking place in magnets, for those with low blood pressure to carry in their pockets on July 11, and old copper coins for pregnant women to place as charms in their belly buttons.; As in Hawaii, Mexico could probably use some otherworldly intervention to cope with the scores of thousands of tourists who have already started arriving.; In the southern half of the Baja Peninsula, some hotels have had rooms reserved for more than a year. All are now booked up, and authorities fear competition at campsites.; We're worried that Californians will drive down on the spur of the moment, without taking water or fuel, said Marivi Lerdo, who promotes tourism to Mexico in New York.; Although Hawaii's isolation will limit the size of the crowds, locals are still predicting problems.
