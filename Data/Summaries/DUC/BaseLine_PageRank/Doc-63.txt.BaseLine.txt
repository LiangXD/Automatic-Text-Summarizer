Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the Senate Judiciary Committee, in confirming four justices without learning how they felt about abortion, has given them a free ride and should be tougher in ferreting out Thomas' views.; The failure to give an answer may cause me and others to be unwilling to vote for his confirmation, Metzenbaum said on CBS This Morning. ; Sen. I do not think it is appropriate to ask a nominee the ultimate question as to how he is going to decide a specific case, Specter said.; I will not support yet another Reagan-Bush Supreme Court nominee who remains silent on a woman's right to choose, and then ascends to the court to weaken that right, said Metzenbaum, the only member of the Judiciary Committee who voted against Thomas' nomination to the Circuit Court of Appeals to the District of Columbia.; Sen. An unabashed conservative, he would succeed the court's leading liberal -- and first and only black justice.; Bush rejected suggestions that he chose Thomas because he wanted to keep a black in that seat.; I kept my word to the American people and to the Senate by picking the best man for the job on the merits. Paul Simon, D-Ill.; When head of the EEOC during the Reagan administration, Thomas seemed to go out of his way to find ways to weaken some of the basic civil rights protections, said Simon, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.; On a number of occasions Thomas has expressed objections to racial quotas.
