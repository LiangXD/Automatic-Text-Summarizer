Today, for the first time, men can cross the channel underground, French President Francois Mitterrand said. What a brilliant sign of the vitality of our two countries. The smiling pair then clasped hands, embraced and exchanged their national flags. God save the queen! cried French workers, uncorking Champagne bottles. Saturday's handshake came three years to the day after tunneling began at Sangatte, near Calais, and in Folkestone, England. The connection ended Britain's island separation from continental Europe for the first time since the last Ice Age about 8,000 years ago. Fagg and Cozette were chosen by draw from among the 3,000 workers to represent their countries in Saturday's meeting. Michel Delebarre and Malcolm Rifkind, the French and British transportation ministers, rode in small service trains down the maintenance tunnel to witness the handshake. But Britain has shown worry over the loss of its historic moat from the Continent. Many Britons fear drug traffickers or terrorists will invade their island via the tunnel.
