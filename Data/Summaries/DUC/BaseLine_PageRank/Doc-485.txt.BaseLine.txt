Botanist Linda Leigh, who has spent the last three weeks literally in her element, called her stay in an experimental biosphere a success Wednesday but said she's ready to return to Earth. "I'll be emerging tomorrow at 2 p.m. as scheduled, and everything is rolling," she said. Scientists plan to place four men and four women inside a much larger sealed structure for two years to determine whether humans can duplicate Earth's life systems for possible use in space. Two people also check her psychologically each day, Ms. Leigh said, "just to make sure that my state of mind or humor is normal." 12 of sorghum, rice flour and sweet potatoes harvested from her mini-field. Her colleagues serenaded her with "Happy Birthday" by video and directed her to gifts hidden in her living area. Lemon grass, mint, tarragon and fennel are among the herbs she has used to season her meals and make tea. Samples are passed through a special port for outside analysis, along with samples of waste water and her urine. Either that, "or I go out into what we call 'the wilderness' and just stay out within the plants."
