Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982. Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research. The miniature versions are as impossible to redirect or squelch as their full-size cousins, he says. He has tried by crawling right up next to them and using rulers or books to change their direction. But one occurred within about 15 miles of my hometown. Of course, I was 20 miles away from that one. They're just like human beings: The rich may become richer and the poor may get poorer. But Fujita considers his work on other air movements called downbursts and microbursts among his most significant achievements. Scientists long thought the drafts dissipated before reaching the ground. Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, but are more dangerous because they give pilots less time to react, Fujita said. The Doppler radar system was credited with helping three jetliners at Denver's airport avoid potentially catastrophic microbursts last year. Fujita retires from teaching this year, but will continue his research at the university. In Texas one time, five people were killed when they drove right into a tornado.
