Sadly, the more evidence that accumulates, the more heatedly they seem to deny it. If these deliberations are serious, the evidence on this page and elsewhere the past two weeks should cause some thoughtful senators to reconsider. As judge, he's sided with the minority plaintiff in seven of eight cases. He ridicules the flighty excesses of the Warren Court, but refers to settled First, Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights to privacy. Ralph Neas was already gunning for whoever was nominated to replace Lewis Powell when Teddy Kennedy rallied the troops with his outrageous speech. Even Harvard's Laurence Tribe got into the game by mischaracterizing Judge Bork's Ninth Amendment views, not to mention Justice Black's. A Howard Metzenbaum staffer successfully and possibly criminally intimidated a black law professor into canceling his testimony. Now, to justify supporting this assault, the supposedly statesmanlike Howell Heflin is attacking Judge Bork from the right. With the success of this campaign, in short, it will be open season on the independence of the judiciary.
