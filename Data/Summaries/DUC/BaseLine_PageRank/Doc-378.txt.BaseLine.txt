The plan neglects our basic human rights, said Misao Kamiyama, chairman of the All Japanese Garrison Forces Labor Union, which represents 1,200 workers at the U.S. bases. The union asked the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, which hires Japanese workers for the bases, to urge the U.S. to drop the polygraph requirement. In Japan, only criminals get that kind of treatment, Mr. Kamiyama said. We are planning a full-scale nationwide protest against the decision if the agency doesn't respond by today. Under the plan, only employees at Navy plants would have to take the tests.
