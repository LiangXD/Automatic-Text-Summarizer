Four of nine Soviet research stations, which were strategically placed around the continent to act as markers for future claims, have been closed. But the National Science Foundation, which runs U.S. bases, thinks that the government's commitment to Antarctica will wane, what with new restrictions on mineral development and declining Soviet competition. The U.S. Navy for instance, regularly pays for about one-fourth of all oceanographic research, much of it centered on the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. This year, after a budget battle, more money was appropriated for U.S. Antarctica research, partly by redirecting funds earmarked for housing for the poor. It was politically inspired, says Alfred Fowler, head of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Program. Nations realized they needed a base to qualify for membership in the treaty system that governs Antarctica, which was up for renegotiation this year. The rest is earmarked for planes, ships and helicopters to ferry researchers; for other logistics; and for environmental cleanup. At Vostok station, famed for its studies of ice cores that disclose ancient atmospheres, the Soviets were so strapped for cash that they asked France to pay the salaries of Soviet workers as part of an international program. Argentina and Chile claim parts of Antarctica as extensions of their countries, even though the Antarctic Treaty effectively makes the continent international territory. They bring families to live in Antarctica, not just scientists, encourage women to give birth at their bases and postmark letters there -- all to back claims of sovereignty.
