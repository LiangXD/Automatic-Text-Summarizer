He believes tidal forces can trigger earthquakes, a theory most scientists reject. As Person talked, 24 seismographs etched out activity recorded by monitoring equipment in different parts of the United States, ranging from Alaska to Tennessee. A needle jumped a few inches across the seismograph connected to monitoring equipment in Tonopah, Nev. Quick calculations showed the quake was magnitude 3.5, centered about 30 miles southwest of Ely, Nev. Between midnight and evening, four moderate quakes were recorded at Golden. Three were in the South Pacific, a 5.9-magnitude shaker near New Caledonia, and quakes of 5.1 and 5.0 in the area of Tonga. About 800 quakes between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.9 are recorded each year, said USGS spokesman Don Finley in Washington. The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by an earthquake. The big San Francisco Bay area quake last year registered 7.1 on the Richter scale. In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said. This fall, there have been two in the New Madrid Fault area, magnitude 4.6 on Sept. Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said. Some people watch precursor activity, but that doesn't always lead to an earthquake.
