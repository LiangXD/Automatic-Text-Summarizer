In this town of reproach and recrimination, it seems increasingly clear that publishing well is the best revenge. His unsuccessful bid for a seat on the nation's highest court forms only a part of his book, Bork said. By politicizing the courts, Bork elaborated, Americans have eaten away at the people's right to legislate the laws we want to live by. No better example comes to mind, Bork said, than the ongoing furor over abortion. To Bork, that means that a major heresy has entered into the American political system. But his rigidness and his archconservative views frightened many people, inside and outside the Senate. In his own confirmation hearings, many senators wanted political results from the courts, Bork said. They had what they accused President Reagan of having, and that is, they had a litmus test. The angry sessions were marked by a level of communication that was not very high, Bork said. But this tempting, or political manipulation of the courts, long predated his attempt to secure a seat on the Supreme Court, Bork said. In large part, Bork blasts law schools for undermining what he describes as constitutional legitimacy. We may also expect a constitutional law that lurches suddenly in one direction or the other. Constitutional law, in short, Bork said, has come to be seen as a political weapon. Nevertheless, it will tell his side of the story of his battle with the Senate. Of course, Bork declared with the same bombastic assertiveness that became familiar in the lengthy confirmation hearings. Well, I wouldn't want anyone else to tell it, would I?
