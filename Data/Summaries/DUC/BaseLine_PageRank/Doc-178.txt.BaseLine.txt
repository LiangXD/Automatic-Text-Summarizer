Hurricane Joan's 80 mph winds churned across the open Caribbean today on an unusual southern path that has forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible landfall. There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead or missing in a town in Colombia the day before. "You just don't see many hurricanes that take this course and hug the coast." Water roared down three gullies in the town as the storm passed Monday, Victor Leon Mendoza, a state government administrator, told the Colombian radio chain RCN. "Preliminary reports from the mayor's office indicate that about 50 persons are dead or missing" in the town, he said. Joan, the Atlantic season's fifth hurricane, is expected to bring 4 to 8 inches of rain along its path. Normally, prevailing winds and upper-level atmospheric conditions push tropical storms northward as they move from the Atlantic, said Gross.
