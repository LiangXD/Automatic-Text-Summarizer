In Valdez, Alaska, the Coast Guard confirmed Saturday that a fresh oil sheen has seeped from the ruptured Exxon Valdez and that a complete cleanup of the damaged tanker is impossible. What we're getting is that clinging oil mixed with water that causes sheen. Unfortunately, it's impossible to completely remove the oil unless you steam-clean the tanker, and nobody intends to do that, Robbins said. Robbins did not give an estimate of how widespread the oil sheen, or shininess on the water's surface, had become. Time-Consuming Repairs He said he doubted the vessel, which is undergoing temporary repairs 30 miles from the March 24 site where the Exxon Valdez ruptured on a reef, will be moved soon. 11-Million-Gallon Spill The Senate action came five weeks after the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef, spewing more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into the fish- and wildlife-rich sound.
