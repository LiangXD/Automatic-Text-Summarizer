Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a strain of mad cow disease affecting a type of antelope can be transmitted much more easily than was thought. The scientists say there is no evidence that similar transmission is occurring among cows. The zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Of eight animals born in the herd since 1987, five have contracted the disease. Only one of the five could have eaten feed containing protein from sheep, believed to be the origin of the outbreak. The infective agent and its mode of transmission are unknown, but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be more easily infected than others. If this were so, it would have important implications for the disease in cows. The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.
