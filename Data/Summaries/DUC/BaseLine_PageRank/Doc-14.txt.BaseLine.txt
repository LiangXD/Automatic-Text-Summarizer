GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insurance claims arising from Hurricane Andrew could 'cost it as much as Dollars 40m.' It believes this threshold may be breached in respect of Hurricane Andrew claims. However, if this happens, it would suffer a post-tax loss of Dollars 40m (Pounds 20m). Mr Nelson Robertson, GA's chief general manager, explained later that the company has a 1/2 per cent share of the Florida market.
