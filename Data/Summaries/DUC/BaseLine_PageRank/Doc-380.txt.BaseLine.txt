A lie detector that measures brain waves would be more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says its developer. "It would probably not falsely accuse any innocent people, and it would probably pick up 70 to 90 percent of guilty people," says J. The American Medical Association and the congressional Office of Technology Assessment have said polygraphs are wrong 15 percent to 50 percent of the time. Rosenfeld's lie detector picks up brain-wave activity through electrodes attached to the scalp, amplifying the signals and feeding them into a computer, which coordinates the information and displays it on a video screen. "If sensory information has a special meaning for you... then your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the P3 wave," he said.
