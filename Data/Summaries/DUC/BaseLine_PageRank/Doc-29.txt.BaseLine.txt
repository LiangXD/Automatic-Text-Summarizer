One sergeant reported that the suspect kept trying to move around and had to be told to remain lying down. Another officer reported that the only verbal abuse was by the suspect toward officers.; The suspect subsequently complained of brutality. In response to another officer's inquiry, the original officer picked up the suspect, let his head fall to the pavement and said, It looks like he's dead. He correctly notes that it is important for police credibility that police chiefs break the code of silence and repudiate such acts and attitudes.; Unfortunately, MacNamara also believes that San Jose does not need a citizens' review board. State privacy laws combined with investigation and reporting procedures keep brutality complaints sealed.; This is bad public policy. Those government employees who are given the right and the power to use force against citizens should be the most accountable. Having the fox guard the chicken house fails to provide that assurance.; The attitude of the public will determine the effectiveness of the police discipline system. I would further recommend that local communities establish citizen review boards.; Police accountability includes the right of the public to review records of investigations of complaints.
