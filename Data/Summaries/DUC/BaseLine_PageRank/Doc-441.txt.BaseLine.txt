'Only God can help us through this crisis,' said the Afrikaner preacher called to provide spiritual guidance to South Africa's farmers, who have been hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory. Indeed, in the eastern Transvaal town of Bethal, where Dominee Nel was delivering his sermon at a farmers' meeting earlier this week, elderly residents say this drought is the worst since 1933. But Mr Koos du Toit, chief economist of the South African Agricultural Union, says it is the worst drought he has ever seen, and the most widespread. Farmers who produce maize, South Africa's staple food, will be the hardest hit, with stock farmers also at risk. Mr du Toit endorses comparisons with 1933, a highly emotive year for Afrikaners because of the numbers forced off the land by drought. Given the ruling National Party's current unpopularity among whites - especially farmers, who are traditionally ultra-conservative - this could prove a serious political blow to the reform process. Farm labourers, most of them black, could lose their jobs; with about 1m employed in farming overall, this could be a severe problem.
