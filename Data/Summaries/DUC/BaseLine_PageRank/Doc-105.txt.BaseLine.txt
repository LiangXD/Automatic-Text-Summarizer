The panel, in recommendations Thursday to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits to allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn. Experts say fire renews forests, giving new species a chance to grow, encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients. But it also said that "in some cases the social and economic effects" of allowing a forest fire to burn "may be unacceptable." Some 249 fires seared 706,278 acres within the park boundaries and 40 percent as much again in nearby national forests. Residents in the fire vicinity complained bitterly that the park, tourism and the very air they breathed were being ruined by the failure to control the fires. However, it did not consider policies in other areas such as ordinary national forests, where the Forest Service tries to protect commercial timbering operations.
