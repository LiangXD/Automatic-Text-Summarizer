Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast. Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation. "It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that," McAdie said. "We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate," Clark said. To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane. "Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true," Emmanuel said. "We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products," Pyke said, "and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path."
