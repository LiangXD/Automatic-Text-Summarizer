You do have visits by the Coast Guard, but those are paper certifications," said Jim Burnett, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. "There may not be sufficient safety standards," he said, adding that his agency has probed fires aboard four cruise ships in the past five years. Because the NTSB lacks regulatory authority and because cruise ships are often registered outside the United States, he said his agency can only make recommendations. Its engine room was badly damaged by the fire, and there was smoke and water damage throughout the 17-year-old French-made ship, which has since been repaired. Burnett estimated damages at about $20 million, but SeaEscape officials did not answer questions at the hearing. SeaEscape lawyer Nils Linfors Jr. vowed to challenge in court the NTSB's authority to hold such public hearings as Wednesday's. Atissue is that the board does not permit cross-examinations and contentions that the Bahamian-registered ship is outside the agency's jurisdiction. Firefighting efforts were hampered when an automatic carbox dioxide extinguishing system failed, and had to be operated by hand. NTSB records show that between September 1987 and February 1988, there were at least six leaks in fuel pipes that feed the engines.
