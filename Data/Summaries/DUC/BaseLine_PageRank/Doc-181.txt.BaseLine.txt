The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the last six hurricane seasons. Those years brought just two to five hurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985. The hurricane season officially begins June 1, and its most active period usually begins Aug. 1. Gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annual hurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his first formal 1988 forecast in late May. "It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season," Gray said in a paper presented to the conference.
