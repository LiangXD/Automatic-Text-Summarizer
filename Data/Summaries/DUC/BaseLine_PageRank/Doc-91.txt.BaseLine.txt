Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens benefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra seats in the House. Because there is a 435-seat limit, when one state gains a House member another must lose one. Subcommittee Chairman Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., however, said he is unsure whether the bills backed by Ridge and others are constitutional. The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to cound all the "persons" in the country every 10 years for purposes of reapportionment. "Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens," added Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wis. and William F. Goodling, R-Pa., asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basic right to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congress to states where the aliens live.
