President Bush today said he could suppport an increased minimum wage but only if Congress also established a sub-minimum training wage he said would prevent a loss of jobs. At no point did he say outright that he supported raising the minumum wage, which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981. The president's comments came a day after Mrs. Dole told the Senate Labor Committee that Bush's support of legislation to raise the minimum wage would hinge on whether lawmakers included a training wage in the legislation. Bush's stand puts him in opposition to the head of the Labor Committee, Edward M. Kennedy, who said Thursday he remained opposed to a training wage and was confident his bill to raise the minimum hourly wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 would pass this year. Mrs. Dole, sworn in to her Cabinet post four hours before the hearing, was not specific as to how high Bush favors raising the minimum wage or what kind of time limit to set on the training wage. "Minorities, the disadvantaged, persons with disabilities and other groups traditionally left behind will be in demand by employers as never before, but only if they are qualified," Mrs. Dole said.
