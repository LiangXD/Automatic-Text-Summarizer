"You eliminate all those causes, you're down to arson," said Dale Smallwood, a criminal investigator for Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest. A psychologist's study found economic and even aesthetic reasons why some people light woods aflame. On average, Smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires each year in Missouri are deliberately set. "It's probably 90 percent higher than the national average," said Ron McDonald, Mark Twain's fire control officer. He said Mark Twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem. "It's just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary (deliberately set) fires," McDonald said. The tradition seems to stretch across the southern United States, according to Smallwood. Fires in other areas are more likely to be caused by lightning or man's carelessness. The Forest Service is charged with protecting wildlands, and balancing recreational needs with commercial interests in timber and mineral resources. The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set. "In the springtime, people used to burn the woods to allow grass to grow." Psychologist John P. Shea in the 1940s conducted one of the first Forest Service studies of arson. "Their ways are those of frontiersmen living in an arrested frontier," Shea wrote. Over the years, timber has been touted as a cash crop that is as worthy of protection as grassland. "They just happened to be driving through an area they thought needed to be burned out." Still, the arsonist does not always fit the profile of a simply misguided citizen. McDonald, who oversees about 125 Mark Twain employees trained as firefighters, said forest fires cost $25 to $30 an acre to suppress. He noted that in some cases, people who have evidence withhold it for fear of being burned out themselves.
