What usually results from this ill-considered radical surgery is that the very people who scheduled the operations end up in the recovery room. The Republicans in 1951 wanted to ensure that there would never be another F.D.R., so they pushed through the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms. The quack therapy being performed on them is the imposition of limits on the number of terms that state lawmakers can serve. 18, when Oklahoma voters endorsed overwhelmingly a ballot initiative limiting state lawmakers to 12 years' service. It is, rather, the kind of minor political tempest that gets highlighted briefly by the media, is copied in a few places and then disappears. Where state legislators are underpaid, have no professional staffs and meet rarely, they usually come under the sway of full-time governors, executive-branch bureaucrats and highly paid lobbyists. But it's a safe bet that more people will be using state seats to groom for higher office if they know that the law will force them out soon. Their influence over these legislative birds of passage will grow because they will be guaranteed a perennial crop of callow and ignorant lawmakers. One thing that legislators now have going for them is that they can become conversant with public issues and so challenge, if they care to, the self-serving propaganda of the special interests. These unelected officials are permanent and beyond the reach of voters, while the very people who are in some measure accountable will be hustled out of office.
