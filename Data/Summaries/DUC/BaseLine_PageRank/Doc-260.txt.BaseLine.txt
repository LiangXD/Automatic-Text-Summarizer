For those who eked out some production, or had grain stored from previous years, it wasn't too bad. The latest postmortem of the 1988 drought's effects was written by Gerald W. Whittaker of the department's Economic Research Service. Basic findings: _Net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to an average of $28,899 per farm from $38,122 in 1987. As used by the agency, net farm income includes gross income from farming during the calendar year, including federal payments, minus costs of production. The nine states studied as the "drought region" were Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The report noted that higher market prices helped reduce the direct payments to farmers in 1988 under USDA's commodity programs. The Agriculture Department says inspectors are on guard against items that can carry Boophilus ticks into the United States. For example, animal carcasses with hides attached are not eligible for importation into the United States. Glosser said raw and untreated hides and antlers may qualify if they are certified by the Mexican government to have been treated for ticks.
