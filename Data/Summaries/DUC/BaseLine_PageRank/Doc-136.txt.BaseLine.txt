Not until early Sunday morning did Beatriz Martinez, 29, cross the U.S./Mexican border to register for, then reach the starting line of, the San Diego International Marathon on East Mission Bay Drive. I wasn't 100% sure I'd win, he said through an interpreter, but I had much confidence that I'd do well. I went out real conservative, I ran my own race and it paid off. And for Beatriz Martinez, who ran cross country for San Diego City College in 1988, he might as well have won the lottery. I want to help my family and friends who raised the money for me, said Beatriz Martinez, a school teacher in Mexico City. Doug Kurtis of Detroit was successful in his bid to run his 12th marathon in a calendar year under 2 hours, 20 minutes. Kurtis was originally awarded third place, but miscommunication somewhere along the 26.2-mile course gave Castillo third in his first marathon and moved Kurtis to fourth. According to Dr. Bill Burke, co-owner of the marathon, Castillo was told several times that he was running the marathon course, but he decided to continue. I traveled too much to get here to go home and say I went the wrong way, Castillo said, also using an interpreter. Although the city didn't allow any vehicles on the course from miles 18-22, Burke said cameras would verify that he did cover the complete distance. Bustos of Las Vegas, N.M., led for the first 14 miles, followed closely by Plaatjes, Beatriz Martinez and LeDoux. Marathon Notes Marie Rollins' time is the fourth best for women in San Diego-area marathon history and breaks Chantal Best's 1988 race record of 2:42:22.
