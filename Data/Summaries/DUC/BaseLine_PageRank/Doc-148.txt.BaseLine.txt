THE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issued today by Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president. The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990s. In the directive, Mr Preston says poverty reduction is 'the benchmark by which our performance as a development institution will be measured'. He adds that the new instructions to staff are intended to 'ensure that these policies are fully reflected in the bank's operations'.
