The figure is the first official tally of the damage resulting from the hurricane, which ripped through southern Florida last week. President George Bush yesterday made his second visit to the region since the hurricane hit. Mr Gary Kerney, director of catastrophe services at the PCS, said the industry was expecting about 685,000 claims in Florida alone. Yesterday's estimate does not include any projection for claims in Louisiana, which was also affected by the storm, although less severely than Florida. By contrast, insurance claims resulting from the Los Angeles riots earlier this year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the US - totalled just Dollars 775m. Hurricane Andrew leaves the US property-casualty insurers facing their worst-ever year for catastrophe losses. Wall Street, however, has reacted calmly to the record losses expected, and insurers' shares - although lower initially - have been firming recently.
