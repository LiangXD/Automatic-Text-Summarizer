But Thomas, who has risen in Republican ranks as an advocate of bootstrap conservatism, would present a striking change from Marshall, a civil-rights pioneer and an anchor of the court's declining liberal faction.; Thomas, barely half the age of the man whose seat he was named to fill, came of age in the world that Marshall helped create.; Now the question is to what extent Thomas would add weight to the court's new majority that appears willing to dismantle important parts of the legacy that Marshall helped to build.; While not much is known about Thomas' views on most issues likely to come before the court, he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action and to policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences.; Opposes affirmative action; In his year as a federal appeals court judge, he has not ruled on affirmative action, but he has long been outspoken in taking the position that government affirmative-action programs are not only unwise but unconstitutional.; However, in other respects, this nomination is very much a wild card both for conservatives who jumped instantly to embrace it and for liberals whose responses ranged from cautious to hostile.; His views on other major issues before the court, including abortion, church-state relations and the definition of constitutional due process, are unknown. Those views may well remain unknown through a confirmation process that may be contentious but that in the end is not likely to derail the nomination.; Studied for priesthood; Thomas attended Roman Catholic schools through college and studied for the priesthood. Although the Catholic Church vigorously opposes abortion, Thomas has apparently never taken a public position on abortion or on the dimensions of the constitutional right to privacy, on which the right to abortion was based.; His position on affirmative action is probably sufficient to shift the court's direction since the court remains closely divided.; My opposition to preferences and quotas not only is a constitutional, legal opposition, it has been a moral, ethical opposition, he said five years ago at a conference sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.; In its most recent affirmative-action decision, a year ago, the court split 5-4 in upholding a Federal Communications Commission policy that gives preference to blacks and members of other minorities in acquiring some radio and television licenses.; Justice William Brennan wrote that decision a few weeks before he retired from the court.
