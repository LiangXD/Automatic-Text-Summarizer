They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes. Their work, directed by Dr. Manuel O. Diaz, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It adds to the growing list of cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of particular genes. In the latest work, the researchers found that this section of the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, they left open the possibility that some other gene in this region besides those that make interferon could also be the tumor-suppressing gene.
