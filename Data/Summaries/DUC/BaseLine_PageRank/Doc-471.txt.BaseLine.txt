In the type of leukemia suffered by the patients, white blood cells have turned malignant at an immature stage of cell development. The acne drug is believed to trigger these immature but malignant cells to divide and mature and then die essentially a natural death. Tretinoin is sold in ointment form as Retin-A, the acne medication produced by Johnson &amp; Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceutical division. Roche, which has a long history of making retinoic acids, sells one of its acids as Accutane, a pill for treating severe acne. It is an uncommon cancer, afflicting about 1,000 Americans a year, in which certain cells in the bone marrow become malignant before they have matured into fully functioning white blood cells. Until now, chemotherapy with standard anti-cancer drugs has been the only effective treatment for acute promyelocyltic leukemia, but it produces cures in only about a third of patients. Last year, molecular geneticists identified one of the genes in chromosome 17 that was damaged when the chunk of the chromosome broke loose.
