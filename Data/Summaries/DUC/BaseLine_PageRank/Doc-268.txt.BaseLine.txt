Tapia emphasized that the Shining Path faction led by Abimael Guzman Reinoso enjoys government favor, and among other things has been given assistance in organizing a second party congress. He said that imprisoned Shining Path members of the Guzman-led faction, such as Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, have been allowed to tour several prisons and to promote debates to support the proposal of so-called President Gonzalo. Tapia said: The Shining Path was defeated, but it seems that after the beginning of negotiations, Abimael Guzman's leadership has been consolidated, tied to the commitment to organize a second party congress. Tapia believes the government is seeking to strengthen Abimael Guzman's leadership within Shining Path, countering the hardline faction led by Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka Feliciano. For his part, ex-leftist Senator Enrique Bernales has said that the Guzman group is trying to sell itself in order to eventually gain its freedom and later regroup.
