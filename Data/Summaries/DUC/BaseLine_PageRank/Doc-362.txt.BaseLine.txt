Not since the great Holmes and Frankfurter have we had a jurist with such impeccable credentials. Then he taught at Yale Law School, until leaving to become U.S. Solicitor General, the government's top litigator. During this entire period, he has inquired boldly and publicly into the nature of law and our society. At Yale, he moved from pure libertarian to the Founders' view of ordered liberty under the rule of constitutional law. His The Antitrust Paradox is the book with the single most influence on the Supreme Court. Many federal judges look to his 1984 lecture on Tradition and Morality in Constitutional Law as a guide to approaching constitutional issues. His integrity and intellect have won admirers who range across the political and ideological spectrum. Any likely alternative, such as Orrin Hatch, would be a much more activist judge, though a far less distinguished one. Their fear is precisely that the power of his intellect and scholarship would leave his stamp on the law and the nation. That judges should set aside the decisions made by the elected branches of government only when the Constitution demands it. That they should refuse to hear cases that raise purely political, not legal, issues. These once-conventional doctrines are seen as threatening by the elites of the law schools, bar associations and judiciary who enjoy the power of activism. Judges are usurping the role of others by running school systems, jails and the telecommunications industry. To the hurrahs of many liberals, judges busily discover new rights in constitutional penumbra. The critics chased themselves into the corner of results-based evaluation of prospective judges by drawing the logical conclusion of judicial activism.
