Sarah Talbot-Williams, a spokeswoman for the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's main employers' group says, 1992 is going to produce a much more competitive market. If we don't have the infrastructure to get the goods to Europe, we'll continue our status as an island. Long plagued by soaring costs and drilling delays, the tunnel now looks set to open on time in June 1993. British diggers, who once lagged months behind schedule, currently are just one week behind; their French counterparts are running three months ahead of plan. There will be no more talk of crisis, says Alastair Morton, chief executive officer of Eurotunnel PLC, the consortium building the cross-channel link. The money will be together this year, and the project will be clear from there. European Rail Link Ltd., a consortium formed last November to build the rail link, had asked the government to contribute #350 million towards the total #2.6 billion cost of the link. Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson told the House of Commons that the consortium's plans involved unacceptable risks for taxpayers. He said British Rail, which owns 50% of the consortium, would consider other options for a fast-rail link. Britain will enter the 21st century with an inadequate 19th-century railway link, said John Prescott, the Labour Party's transportation spokesman. Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services. If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links.
