Terry Anderson's daughter pleaded for the father she loves but has never known to come home today, the day Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in Lebanon. The journalist's family, friends and colleagues somberly marked the anniversary with commemorations and prayers in Washington, New York and Cyprus. Yellow ribbons fluttered from trees, signs and poles in Anderson's hometown of Batavia, N.Y. Anderson 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, is the longest-held of the American hostages in Lebanon. All told, 18 Westerners are believed to be captives there, including eight Americans. But no message was as poignant as the one on television this evening in Lebanon. In a videotape, Anderson's 4-year-old daughter Sulome appeared, wearing a green coat and riding a bicycle given to her at Christmas in Anderson's name. Thank you, said Sulome, who was born 83 days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim faction in Beirut. The videotape was made earlier in the week and shipped to the television stations in Beirut. Lebanese newspapers also published a letter today signed Sulome and Madeleine, from the girl and her mother, Madeleine Bassil, who wait in Cyprus for Anderson's release. In Washington, Bush pledged to pursue all legitimate opportunities to win the release of the hostages.
