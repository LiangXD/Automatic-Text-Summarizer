The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow' disease - which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK - is causing a new wave of public concern. New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a brain disorder similar to BSE. 'I find it unbelievable that the government and their hand-picked advisers can go on telling the public there is no danger.' 'Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said. 'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.' Another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features typical of the 'sporadic form' of CJD - of unknown cause - that usually occurs in late middle age. The handful of patients known to have developed CJD through infection (from contaminated human growth hormone) showed a different pattern of symptoms. Although sheep-derived feeds were banned from sale in 1988, farmers apparently continued to use existing stocks for longer than the ministry had expected. According to their investigations, maternal transmission from cow to calf - which would prolong the epidemic - is very rare or non-existent. Scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem: BSE, scrapie and CJD are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which does not follow the normal rules of microbiology. Most independent experts maintain that no human being - dairy farmer or beef eater - is likely to be exposed to BSE in sufficient quantities to develop brain disease.
