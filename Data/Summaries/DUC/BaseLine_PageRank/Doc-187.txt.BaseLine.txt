Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, are ill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center. Some states such as Florida and Texas will experience near 200 percent growth during the period, the report said. Gilbert killed more than 300 people and caused heavy damage from the Lesser Antilles to Mexico. Hurricane activity started dropping after drought conditions began in the early 1960s in Africa's Sahel region, he said. Between 1940 and 1969, the United States was hit by 22 hurricanes with minimum winds of 110 mph. From 1970 to 1989, there were only eight such storms, including Hugo, Sheets said. In the Caribbean, officials have worked to improve communications systems after links were cut by Gilbert.
