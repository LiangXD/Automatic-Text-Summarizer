Patience is often difficult to muster for those who run the 26.2 miles of a marathon. Yanmin broke the old record of 2:44:51 set last year by Dianne Rodgers. The weather for the first 1 1/2 hours was cloudy and cool. The refrain from the runners was, It's not the heat, it's the humidity. One by one they fell victim to the weather or other equally debilitating elements. Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union, who had been among the leaders for most of the race, said he had trouble with everything. American food also did not agree with Gural -- his stomach was upset. Samson Obwocha, a Kenyan who lives in Gardena, waited for Gural to fade and then made his move. I saw him struggling and I knew I could outkick him, Obwocha said. But I wanted to run at 5-minute pace, so I had to lead. Tomio Bueyoshi of Japan was second in 2:15:31 and Liu Wenzun of China was third in 2:19:16. Guadalupe Roman of Mexico led through much of the race but lost ground steadily in the last five miles and finished sixth. Two Soviet runners -- Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva -- who had run side-by-side in third and fourth place throughout the race, faded. It fell to Konatz, who had been in first and second throughout the race, to hang in there. Asked if she was ever aware of Yanmin during the race, Konatz laughed.
