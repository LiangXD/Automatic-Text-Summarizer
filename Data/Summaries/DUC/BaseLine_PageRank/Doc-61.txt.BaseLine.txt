Thomas, 41, will be a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. It became clear Monday night that Thomas' critics had failed to muster enough support to defeat his nomination. "I am prepared to concede that Mr. Thomas is going to be confirmed," said Sen.

Danforth, Thomas' chief Senate supporter and former employer, said he could vouch for the nominee's abilities as a lawyer. "People say, 'Don't you ever make a mistake?' Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., dismissed complaints that Thomas had failed to cooperate with the Aging Committee several years ago when former Sen. Civil rights forces have been divided over the nomination. But the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People did not take a stand on the issue.
