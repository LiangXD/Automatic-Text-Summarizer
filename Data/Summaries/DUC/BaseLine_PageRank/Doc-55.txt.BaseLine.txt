The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients. Anthony Beilenson, who said plainly, The truth is, for welfare reform to be successful, it's got to be expensive. At the same time they say, certain existing benefits -- mainly Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) -- must be increased to offset real declines since the base year of 1970. That conclusion was presumably the basis for the bipartisan consensus that was going to produce a serious welfare-reform bill this year. Of course, House Democrats could hardly promote this bill as more of the same. That might produce reprisals from voters who've watched their tax dollars build and maintain the welfare system, with little evident return on their investment. Instead, after nearly 20 years, the system's defenders and funders repeatedly tell the public that the problem, if anything, has gotten worse. In fact, while the level of AFDC benefits has decreased in real terms since 1970, the total level of all welfare benefits has not. Nearly all AFDC families also receive Medicaid coverage, for instance; more than three-quarters receive food stamps, and one-third have children who receive free school meals. During the unprecedented expansion of the welfare state, the most notable and highly publicized phenomenon has been the development of an entrenched class of long-term welfare dependents. By further increasing rather than gradually reducing the level of benefits available to recipients, it makes welfare more, not less, enticing. Earlier this year, there were hopeful signs that we would see sweeping, serious welfare-reform legislation emerge from Congress.
