U.S. Air Force war planes participating in Operation Desert Shield are flying again after they were ordered grounded for 24 hours following a rash of crashes. Pentagon and Air Force officials said regular training flight schedules resumed Thursday at noon local time (5 a.m. He said Air Force officials wanted to "examine potential hazards and to be sure they were doing everything possible to prevent accidents. Aircraft on operational missions were not grounded, said Col. Miguel Monteverde, another Pentagon spokesman. Those included reconnaissance aircraft, refueling tanker planes and F-15 jets patrolling areas near the Kuwait or Iraqi borders. He said pilots of those planes received special safety briefings but their flight schedules were not changed. Desert Shield, the largest U.S. military buildup since the Vietnam War, involves an estimated 700 Air Force combat and support aircraft. "They're concerned about the accidents, they're concerned about the number of accidents that happened so quickly over a short period of time," he told reporters. Also, 20 other aircraft have been involved in non-fatal accidents in the gulf area, Williams said.
