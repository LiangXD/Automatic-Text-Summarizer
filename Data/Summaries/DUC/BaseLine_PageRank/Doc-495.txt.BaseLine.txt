America's senior military officer Tuesday endorsed the East Bloc's move toward a more defensive military posture and reassured his Warsaw Pact counterparts that the United States and its NATO allies will not launch an offensive military operation against Eastern Europe. At a meeting in Vienna, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cited initial evidence that the Warsaw Pact is restructuring its forces in line with new defensive military doctrines in the wake of the Cold War. Despite the encouraging signs, the West's key concern remains the specter of confronting greatly superior forces armed, trained and suited for offensive ground operations, Powell said in prepared remarks at a Vienna session of defense chiefs representing 35 nations from both the East and the West. For the United States, as for any democracy, glasnost -- public discussions and debates over military strategy and programs -- is as important as perestroika. The Vienna meeting came as the East European nations, several of which sent new defense chiefs to represent them, are debating the roles of their militaries at home and in potential joint military actions with the Soviet Union. Several of those countries, including Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, have moved to impose extraordinary new restrictions on the use of their troops outside their national territories -- gestures that Powell appeared to applaud.
