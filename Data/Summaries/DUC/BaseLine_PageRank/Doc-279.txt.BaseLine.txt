But as Mr. Hart summarized their findings, the discussion quickly centered on the dismay and disgust many voters feel about politics and government these days. Average citizens, the pollsters found, believe they simply are not being heard in Washington, and more and more are losing confidence in the electoral system as a means of influencing government. Normally, when Republicans have a good year, Democrats' average victory margin declines, and vice versa. Voters don't want more conservative or more liberal representation; they want more responsive representation. This helps explain the strong momentum for limiting lawmakers' terms, a sentiment fueled by the recent disclosures of the House banking and restaurant fiascos. But that's of little concern to frustrated voters who are lashing out because nothing else seems to work. Plainly, Congress can best address this frustration by doing a better job on the issues bothering people-health care, taxes, jobs. But there's little consensus among either politicians or the voters themselves on these issues. More important, lawmakers ought to overhaul the disgraceful campaign-finance system to make congressional elections more competitive, and to reduce the role of money and influence peddlers in campaigns. Argues Mr. Ferris: Voters never should be prevented from electing a person who they think is the best representative of that community. This really would challenge these guys to shake up the system, says Mr. Fenno, noting that the power of interest groups is centered in committees. Technology and economics and world dynamics are moving so quickly, but many of these members, while very bright, are locked into outdated beliefs and approaches, he says. If lawmakers had to change areas of expertise every three or four terms, they wouldn't have the luxury of being intellectually lazy.
