"Mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. "I think everyone agrees that the risks are low," says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder." Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986. Earlier this month, the government announced it would pay farmers 100 percent of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE. "In the course of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and totally disoriented." 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE. Ireland's Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of Northern Ireland. David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of "BSE hysteria" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is "remote." A commission chaired by Professor Sir Richard Southwood of Oxford University reported last year that the cause of BSE "is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses."
