Contrary to most of the propaganda on the subject, these constitutional changes won't do what their proponents say they want to accomplish. For example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections. This will require large new infusions of money and electoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it. Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment. Why do we assume that new blood is automatically better than old? Of course we should pay attention to the quality of our legislators and vote against those whose performance we find wanting. Just the opposite, since they create an artificial barrier preventing voters from returning to office legislators they might otherwise favor. They are undoubtedly calculating that non-incumbents are easier to beat, or buy.
