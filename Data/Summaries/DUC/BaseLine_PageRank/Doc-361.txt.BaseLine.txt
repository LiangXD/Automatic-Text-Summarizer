Members of the Senate will soon face one of the most difficult votes of their careers when they evaluate Robert H. Bork's fitness for the Supreme Court. Indeed, when Judge Bork was nominated for the appeals court post in 1981, the Senate unanimously approved. As Columbia University law Prof. Herbert Wechsler explained almost 30 years ago, a neutral-principled judicial decision rests on reasons that in their generality and their neutrality transcend any immediate result that is involved. The Constitution, however, commands a neutral-principled approach to judicial decision making, and a Bork confirmation would help restore the balance among the three branches of government the framers so carefully crafted. Indeed, the framers specifically rejected a system that would have permitted the judiciary to exercise the legislative and executive functions it has arrogated over the past 35 years. James Madison's notes relate the debate: Nathaniel Gorham reflected that judges did not possess any peculiar knowledge of policy that would justify giving them that power, and Elbridge Gerry reminded the delegates that such a role would be foreign from the nature of their office. Law making -- policy making -- by judges has become so pervasive that, of late, many see it as the judicial function against which potential judges must be measured. This bottom-line mentality is why Judge Bork's nomination is at risk even though Judge Bork recognizes that constitutional interpretation must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing times. Our system of justice was designed to resolve disputes and not reshape society according to the whims of even well-intentioned judges. Daniel Webster once warned that the Constitution was made to guard against the dangers of good intentions. In many respects, the judiciary has become the master branch of government because we have permitted judges' personal views to supplant the rule of established law.
