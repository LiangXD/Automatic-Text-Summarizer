Nearly 10,000 firefighters in five Western states are battling hundreds of blazes, most of them sparked last week by lightning. Last year's combination of heat and drought across a wide swath of the West produced a hellish summer of smoke and flame. One of the hardest-hit areas was Yellowstone National Park, where fire blackened about 1 million acres, nearly half the park's territory. The widespread drought of 1988 has been replaced by spotty rain and local areas of dry weather, Sacher said. Forecasters just now are trying to get a handle on what kind of weaer August will bring, Sacher said.
