More than 30 years ago, Life magazine took a look at the burgeoning little desert town of Las Vegas and wondered if it wasn't overbuilt. The year was 1955 and five new resort hotels had just opened, prompting the magazine to question where they would get people to fill them. Now, as Las Vegas undergoes one of the most ambitious of its periodic building booms, there are few who believe that overbuilding is a problem. "There is still a tremendous amount of demand out there that hasn't been satisified," said Rossi Ralenkotter, director of marketing for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Nearly 20,000 new hotel rooms either are under construction or awaiting groundbreaking, as resorts compete to add rooms they hope will bring in even more tourists and gamblers in the near future. Visitor volume nearly has doubled in the last 12 years, with an estimated 17 million tourists each expected to spend an average of 2-3 days in Las Vegas during 1988. Gaming revenues kept pace, growing 14 percent in 1987 to a record $2.74 billion in southern Nevada. "We're penetrating markets we've never penetrated before," said Dave Verbon, publicity director at the Riviera Hotel. "There are vast numbers of people out there we never tried to reach before and now we're going after them and getting them." Already boasting the world's two largest resort hotels, Las Vegas soon will have five hotel-casinos with more than 3,000 rooms apiece. Baldwin says he has few worries that the Nugget will be able to fill its rooms with gamblers and tourists. "In good times everybody does pretty well and the better operators do even better," said Baldwin. "In bad times good operators don't do quite as well but they still do well.
