The official opening of the Channel Tunnel later this year promises to help revitalise the north-west regions of Belgium, even though the country's biggest ports will suffer a loss of traffic. Mr Jo Libeer, managing director of the Courtrai chamber of commerce, is equally optimistic about the likely impact on the area of the tunnel. In its last economic survey of the country, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the Belgian economy had deteriorated 'progressively' since the 1980s. The unemployment rate, which in 1990 was 9.5 per cent in Flanders has risen to 13 per cent. To benefit fully, however, a crucial 7km stretch of the E40 European motorway between Veurne and the French border has yet to be completed. Fortunately, plans to complete the stretch have been agreed and it should be open some time next year. 'Even after the doubling of the tracks and electrification of the railway line between Ghent and De Panne, we will still be a remote corner,' says Mr Claerhout. Furthermore, Belgium's biggest ports are expecting traffic loads to fall, as freight and passengers are directed towards Calais. Worst affected will be Ostend and Zeebrugge, two ports hoping to hold their own by concentrating on links with ports in the north of England. Mr Geert Sanders, who works for the Regional Development Authority of West Flanders, says there is already evidence that the region's enhanced communications are attracting new businesses. But the biggest advantages for Belgium will come from close co-operation between the national and federal authorities and their French and UK counterparts.
