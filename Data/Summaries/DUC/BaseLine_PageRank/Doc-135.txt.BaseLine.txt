Alphonce Swai, who ran in the 1984 Olympics for Tanzania, but who later fell prey to alcoholism, continues his comeback bid in Sunday's America's Finest City HomeFed Half Marathon. Swai began his comeback in late May when he ran the Trib 10K, finishing 16th in 30 minutes 8 seconds. Since then, however, Swai has won two races, the Coronado Half Marathon in July, which he finished in 1:04.50, and the Goodwill Games 10-kilometer run last month in Seattle. The Goodwill Games victory came despite Swai's taking a wrong turn and running 150 yards in another direction before getting back on track. He insists he'll need that kind of a time to beat a bevy of Mexican and African runners. Track &amp; Field News ranked Jones third among women marathoners in 1989 and first among U.S. competitors.
