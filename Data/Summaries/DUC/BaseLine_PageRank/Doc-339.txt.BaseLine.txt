The United States risks losing an unusual opportunity to assert global leadership in protecting Antarctica, Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) said Thursday on the eve of an international conference on the future of the frozen continent. Gore spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Alliance for Antarctica, a coalition of environmental groups. We have no time for half-measures if America is to be the world's leader in protecting Antarctica, Vento said. Congressional legislation calling for preservation of Antarctica is awaiting President Bush's signature, but there has been speculation that the Interior Department might urge Bush to veto the measure. It also would prohibit U.S. exploration or development of minerals in Antarctica. But Tucker Scully, director of the office of ocean affairs at the State Department and the lead U.S. negotiator for Antarctic issues, disagreed with the hands-off approach to the continent. According to environmentalists, Antarctica is being marred by air pollution and tourist ships and threatened by mining. During the peak summer months, about 4,000 people inhabit Antarctica, and tourism is increasing rapidly. Last year, about 3,000 people paid more than $10,000 each to photograph penguins and view the vast sweeps of ice and rock.
