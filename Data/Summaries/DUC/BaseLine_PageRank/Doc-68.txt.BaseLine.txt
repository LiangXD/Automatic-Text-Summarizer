But the lesson that should not be lost is the transcendent one: Clarence Thomas made it in America because he was loved. And when she could no longer care for him she gave him to her parents to bring up, and they loved him too. And they cared enough to scrape together the money every year to put him in a Catholic school where they hoped the nuns would teach and guide him and they did. He got love and love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that he had a place at the table. Not that the hearings will be color blind, it's just that senators are going to use Mr. Thomas's race to prove things about themselves with it. They will demonstrate through measured abuse that they are able to treat a black man as their equal. Those on the left are unmoved by Mr. Thomas's climb from nothing to something because he didn't do it the right way -- through them and with their programs. His triumph refutes their assumptions; his life declares that a good man of whatever color can rise in this country without the active assistance of the state. If Sandra Day O'Connor had thanked the nuns it would have been a skit on Saturday Night Live and an issue in her confirmation.) Expect phrases of rolling sympathy as senators of the left bring up for him his humble origins and congratulate him on his grit and determination. But what, Judge Thomas, about those who were not born with your advantages, and by that I mean not wealth and comfort but brilliance and determination and a family. In 1980, '84 and '88, the American people voted overwhelmingly for presidents who promised to appoint conservative jurists.
