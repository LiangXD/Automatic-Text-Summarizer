Terry D. Barnes, 24, was shot between the eyes in his apartment. It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year. "I just hope that this case will draw the line on where the police can kill an innocent man. Where do you draw the line?" said roommate Andy Brez, 23, who was sleeping in another bedroom when police entered on Saturday. Police said they were told the prowler might have run to the floor on which Barnes lived. Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said. "As for the shooting itself, we will make no assessment of the propriety of that until after the investigation." In June, several white officers bloodied a Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the ground. Both clergymen alleged racism; Bishop suspended some of the officers involved in the May incident. In another case, three undercover officers were suspended for a shooting this spring that left a young black man crippled. Also this year, four oficers riddled a man brandishing a barbecue fork with 15 bullets, killing him. "This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr. Barnes' family and for this officer," Bishop said. "The officers were reacting appropriately to a number of circumstances which together led them to that apartment."
