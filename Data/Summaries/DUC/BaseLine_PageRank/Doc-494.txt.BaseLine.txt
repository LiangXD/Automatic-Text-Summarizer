Although Florida Republicans are hoping to draft Schwarzkopf for a Senate bid, he seems unlikely to trade his fatigues for a candidate's general-issue blue suit. But Powell's ultimate political fate does not now seem likely to be decided in the coming election.; It is true that many Republican strategists say nightly prayers for Bush to replace Quayle with Powell in 1992. And, as the general's career unfolds, Democrats should not assume his loyalties lie irrevocably with the GOP.; To begin with, no one knows Powell's political affiliation. Like many accomplished military commanders -- Eisenhower throughout the 1940s, for example -- Powell has kept everyone guessing.; In the Bronx, N.Y., neighborhood where he is registered to vote, Powell has not stated a party preference. I can tell you, however, that proves how great his political skills are. ; As reticent as he is, though, Powell has publicly expressed views on enough foreign and domestic subjects to give some clues of his leanings. I wish that corporate America, I wish the trade unions around the nation, would show the same level of openness and opportunity to minorities. ; With his foreign-policy views Powell would scrape against some encrusted conventions in today's Democratic Party.
