<P> Far beneath this modern metropolis, the powerful forces of nature are locked in a slow but deadly battle that will some day bring this great city to its knees. </P> <P> Already overcrowded and growing at a staggering rate, Tokyo sits on a deep sedimentary basin that is like a bowl of jello cradled by one of the most treacherous geological formations on the planet. Bluntly put, there are few places on Earth that are geologically less suited as a site for a great city than here on the shores of Tokyo Bay. </P> <P> Three of the giant slabs of the Earth's crust grind together here in what scientists call a triple junction. Scientists are concerned that land reclaimed from the bay will be particularly hazardous because such soils amplify shock waves from earthquakes. </P> <P> Painfully aware of its problems, Japan is moving full speed ahead in earthquake engineering research, and the country is trying to develop the world's best earthquake warning system before the next great quake hits. Frank Press, president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, has speculated that a great quake here would force Japan to reclaim much of its foreign investment, possibly leading to a collapse of the world economy. </P> <P> Tokyo was leveled once, in 1923, when a monstrous earthquake destroyed a city that had ignored the lessons offered in 1906 from a different city by a distant bay. If we had understood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the damages from the Great Kanto Earthquake which came just 17 years later could have been avoided, says Hirokazu Iemura of Kyoto University's Earthquake Engineering Laboratory. </P> <P> Iemura, who toured the Bay Area after last October's quake, is afraid history may repeat itself. The recent San Francisco temblor, he said, demonstrated what scientists call non-linear consequences of an earthquake. </P> <P> That means that in some cases the earth may tremble far more than the magnitude of the quake would suggest. And now, all these years later, Iemura and many other experts in Japan are afraid that history may repeat itself. </P> <P> We are very afraid of fire, said Etsuzo Shima, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and one of Japan's leading earthquake experts. Okada directs a research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. </P> <P> Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations beneath Japan are constantly active. </P> <P> The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the planet. And unfortunately for Tokyo, directly beneath the mega-city, the two oceanic plates are colliding as they sink into the Earth's mantle. </P> <P> Temblors occur as the plates are ripped apart while being forced under the Eurasia Plate, so they strike much deeper than the shallow earthquakes in California. However, they can be quite large, well above magnitude 8, so they pose a great danger to areas on the surface. </P> <P> Furthermore, the strength of an earthquake here is magnified by the geological conditions that underlie nearly the entire city of Tokyo. Shock waves striking the bedrock are reflected back up toward the surface, extending the life of the earthquake. </P> <P> The duration of the shaking is very long, said Oyagi, of the National Research Center for Disaster Prevention. </P> <P> Officials here know those conditions could add up to disaster for Tokyo, a belief that was reinforced by Kyoto University's Iemura when he returned from his tour of the San Francisco Bay Area after the Oct. He has concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. </P> <P> Most experts here had thought that Mexico City was an exceptional case, Iemura said. Local authorities are resisting that suggestion, but Shima insists that some people are now taking it seriously. </P> <P> We are very afraid because we are now going to build a lot of high-rise buildings in the bay area, he said. The Pacific and the Philippine Sea plates are being forced under the Eurasia Plate, and the two subducting plates collide directly beneath Tokyo. </P> <P> That dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, as well as about 1,000 smaller quakes every month. </P>
