The Colombian Government and several presidential candidates today rejected the assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. It has been disclosed that President Cesar Gaviria spoke with his Mexican counterpart Salinas de Gortari by telephone to express his condolences and to support the Mexican Government and people. Dissident liberal candidate Enrique Parejo said the assassination proves once again the serious threat politicians face when they appear at public rallies. Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper, who met with Colosio a few weeks ago, regretted the assassination and said that such violence is the result of savage capitalism. Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana also regretted Colosio's death.
