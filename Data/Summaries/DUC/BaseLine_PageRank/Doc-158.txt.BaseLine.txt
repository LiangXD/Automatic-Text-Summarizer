"It's like Wayne Gretzky getting run over by a car," said Pat Reid, the Canadian high-jump coach. The euphoria was dashed when Johnson tested positive for stanzolol, a muscle-building steroid outlawed by Olympic officials. Dr. George Astaphan, Johnson's personal physician, and Larry Heidebrecht, Johnson's agent, insisted the sprinter had not taken stanzolol. "The only thing we can say is that it is a tragedy, a mistake or sabotage," Heidebrecht said. Johnson, a 26-year-old Jamaican transplant, waved the Canadian flag in triumph and dedicated his gold to his mother and all Canadian citizens. The drug scandal brought the same sickening feeling to the nation as did Gretzky's trade to the Los Angeles Kings. Then 72 hours later, there was this roller coaster ride to the bottom," Frayne said. "He has left Canadians hanging their heads in shame," wrote the Corner Brook Western Star. "He tarnished the name and reputation of Canada and let its people down," said the Fredickton Gleaner. But columnist Gary Lautens of the Toronto Star said the nation should not cover its head in shame. It's believing the end justifies the means, it's looking for an unfair edge," Lautens said.
