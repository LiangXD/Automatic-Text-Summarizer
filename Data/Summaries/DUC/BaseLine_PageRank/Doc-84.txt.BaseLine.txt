Drugs are now available that can put AIDS patients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a vaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel of AIDS experts said Saturday. At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followed by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists said. "We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing remission," said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. "It looks like most of these will be expensive, hard to deliver and require monitoring," Haseltine said. Vaccines to protect animals against AIDS-related viruses have shown some success, he said, encouraging researchers to believe that similar vaccines can be found for humans. "We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades of progress in our tuberculosis control efforts," said Vermund. Many of the cases of tuberculosis are occurring when individuals who were exposed to tuberculosis early in life contract AIDS. They lose the ability to continue suppressing the tuberculosis bacteria, which normally would have remained dormant, and tuberculosis appears.
