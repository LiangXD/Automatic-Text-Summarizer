President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a Cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as "the slar eclipse of the century" on July 11. The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes, the maximum length for a total solar eclipse. People from British Columbia to Buenos Aires will experience at least a partial eclipse. But the special government commission, Eclipse 1991, is banking on the clouds to roll in the country's financial favor. For three years, scientists and astronomy buffs have been staking out turf in Mexico. Tourism officials are seeking private homes and campgrounds, schools and auditoriums to house the influx. Baja California Sur's tourist facilities can only handle 120,000 visitors, and 90 percent of that capacity is booked, tourism director Rodolfo Palacios says. Some 13,500 amateur and professional astronomers from the United States, Japan, Soviet Union, China, Canada, England, France and Germany have confirmed reservations. Some tourists have been booked into one hotel even before it is completed. Cuernavaca, 35 miles south of Mexico City, is hosting a geophysicists' congress during the week of the eclipse. At least one expedition plans to view the show from the 17,887-foot Popocapetl volcano, the country's second-highest peak.
