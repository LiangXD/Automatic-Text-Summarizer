Doctors have noticed a growing prevalence of tuberculosis in recent years among people at high risk of AIDS, especially drug addicts. "The aggressive identification and treatment of HIV-infected intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is therefore of both clinical and public health importance," wrote Dr. Peter A. Selwyn of Montefiore Medical Center in New York. People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria for many years without getting sick. Twenty-three percent of those with HIV also carried TB bacteria as did 20 percent of those who were free of the AIDS virus. During almost two years of followup, active tuberculosis developed in eight of the AIDS-infected people, but in none of those who did not have HIV.
