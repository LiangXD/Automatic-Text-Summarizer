Therefore, British officials believe, France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. It's totally unjustified and illegal, said Patrick Barrow, spokesman for the Meat and Livestock Commission, a trade organization. France accounted for slightly more than half of Britain's beef exports last year, buying 70,000 tons of beef worth $264 million. Although other countries have recently placed some restrictions on British beef and cattle, the French and German moves were the strongest by far. The United States does not import British beef and recently rescinded permits for the importation of live cattle. British officials have been joined by European Community commissioners in protesting the French and Germany import ban. BSE-infected cows degenerate very quickly, said a spokeswoman from Britain's Ministry of Agriculture. BSE has been around for six or seven years, said David Lewis of the Meat and Livestock Commission. Beef sales dropped, with surveys showing that about a quarter of British households had stopped eating it.
