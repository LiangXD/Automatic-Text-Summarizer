Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association has filed a $6 billion civil lawsuit accusing Michael Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk bonds in the 1980s. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by the failing savings and loan, claims that Milken and others manipulated and coerced Columbia and other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky high-yield bonds. "Absent such deceit and manipulations it would have been clear that the market for junk bonds was highly illiquid and that junk bonds were unsuitable investments for savings and loan institutions," the suit says. Milken, the former head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based junk bond department, was sentenced last month to 10 years in prison for six felonies related to illegal trading practices. The lawsuit by Columbia, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, names Milken, nine other Drexel officials and more than 100 investment partnerships sponsored by the collapsed Wall Street firm. It alleges that the thrift lost more than $2 billion on investments in junk bonds and seeks three times that amount under federal racketeering and antitrust laws. Milken resigned from Drexel last year but the statement said he had gradually reduced his day-to-day activity after he was linked to the government's Wall Street investigation in late 1986. The lawsuit joins scores of other civil complaints against Milken for alleged wrongdoing related to his guilty plea as well as other trading activity during his tenure at Drexel, which is now in federal bankruptcy court proceedings. The FDIC and Resolution Trust Corp., which administers the failed thrifts, already have filed a claim for $4.5 billion against Drexel in federal bankruptcy court alleging that fraudulent junk bond dealings caused Columbia heavy losses.
