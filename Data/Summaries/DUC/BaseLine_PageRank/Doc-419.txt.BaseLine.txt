The first contingents of up to 18,000 Southern Baptists began arriving this weekend for an "evangelistic blitz" in the nation's gambling capital. They hope to leave behind 12 new churches and tens of thousands of religious tracts by the end of their annual convention. "I embrace the old philosophy, if someone gives you a lemon, you make lemonade," said John B. Wright, a convention organizer. "We want all the conventions we can get and we don't give a damn who they are," said John Reible, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce. Las Vegas is one of only 15 U.S. cities that can provide the hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention, said Alvin C. Shackleford, a convention spokesman. "It just seemed sooner or later we would accept the invitation of the people of Las Vegas to come," he said. While conventions in recent years have drawn as many as 45,000 people, estimates for the convention running Tuesday through Thursday range from 13,000 to 18,000. The commission would lobby Congress on issues such as organized prayer in public schools and tax credits for tuition paid to parochial schools. On Wednesday, the conference plans to lead thousands of Southern Baptists down the gambling Strip to distribute 10,000 New Testaments and 20,000 gospel tracts, Strack said.
