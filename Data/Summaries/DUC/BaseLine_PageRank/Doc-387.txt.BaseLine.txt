Polygraph machines detect these changes.; Critics, including psychologists, labor unions and many judges, say the polygraph is nothing but a crude interrogation tool with as much credibility as a mood ring. But we aren't made like Pinocchio. ; The public usually hears about polygraph tests when somebody famous takes one, often in situations where it's one person's word against another. William Kennedy Smith's accuser took the test -- and passed -- to prove she was telling the truth when she said he raped her.; Ronald Reagan was fond of polygraph tests. It lost ground in 1989, when the federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act took effect, outlawing pre-employment polygraph testing in most private industry. Twenty-three states allow polygraph results to be admitted as evidence, but usually only if both sides agree in advance. It was invented in the 1920s by William Moulton Marston, a lawyer who later went on to create the comic strip Wonder Woman. ; The testing procedure begins with a discussion of the test and the allegations. One purpose of this pre-test interview is to reduce the subject's anxiety and fear, and take the surprise out of the allegations. Another purpose is to help the examiner craft questions aimed at eliciting both true statements and lies as a basis for comparison.; Not just physiological; The test is not merely physiological. They rely on complex assumptions about human nature and criminal psychology, and their subjects are often unaware how extensively they are being analyzed.; The polygraph test itself is short -- usually no more than 10 questions. Guilty people who pass the test leave undetected.; Those accuracy claims are challenged by polygraph opponents, who point to studies done by polygraphers themselves that say an innocent person has as much as a 50-50 chance of failing.
