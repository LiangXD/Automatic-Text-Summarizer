Juba, southern Sudan's largest city, is 60 miles southwest of the quake's reported epicenter. Scientists said the quake's epicenter was 700 miles south of Sudan's capital, Khartoum. It occurred in sparsely populated territory controlled by the rebels, who hold most of the southern countryside. Relief workers in two rebel-controlled villages, Bor and Torit, apparently told officials in Nairobi, Kenya, the earthquake caused no damage there. "It's pretty low area over there, with low buildings and quite remote," Koepp said. Late Sunday, a Khartoum airport tower operator said flights to the southern city had not been disrupted. People seeking haven from the war and from famine have more than doubled Juba's population of 125,000. In recent years, hundreds of thousands have died in southern Sudan, an area the size of Texas. The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. reported an identical reading. Every increase of one number, say from magnitude 5.5 to magnitude 6.6, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. Last October's earthquake near San Francisco registered 7.1 on the Richter scale. That earthquake zone stretches 4,000 miles from Mozambique through the Red Sea to Lebanon.
