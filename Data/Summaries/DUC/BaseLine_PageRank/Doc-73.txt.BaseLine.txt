And a pilot in Utah escaped injury today in a third military training flight in two days. The crash off Hatteras, N.C., occurred Monday afternoon 22 miles east of Oregon Inlet, the Navy said. The identity of the dead aviator and his missing crewmate were not released pending notification of relatives. Five people, including the two Navy fliers, remained hospitalized today following the crash Monday morning in El Cajon 15 miles east of San Diego. The $35 million jet crashed upside down into hangars at Gillespie Field and exploded. Authorities said the two crewman tried to guide the jet to the runway at Gillespie Field before bailing out. Gary Hughes, commanding officer of Naval Air Station Miramar, said he was grateful there weren't more injuries, "particularly when you're this close to El Cajon. And then we saw the parachutes," said Washington Moscuso, a sixth-grader at Ballantyne Elementary School. The aircraft, assigned to Hill's 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, was on a routine training mission.
