"The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom the vessel. Thick oil has floated over more than 1,640 square miles and soiled 800 miles of beach. Early Tuesday, Exxon said it had finished transferring about 42 million gallons of crude to three other ships. Another 42 million gallons of oily waste water remained aboard the Valdez, which spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince William Sound when it struck a reef March 24. The company said crews would attempt to pump air into the hold and refloat the vessel off a reef at high tide Wednesday afternoon. If freed, the still-leaking ship, which has eight holes some 20 feet long in its hull, will be towed to a remote and already fouled cove for repairs. Port officials there said they weren't sure if they'd allow that, even though the $12 million repair bill would provide about 200 jobs. Neil Goldschmidt said Tuesday there are "a lot of questions that need to be answered" before the Valdez is allowed in. In Washington, Environmental Protection Administrator William Reilly said the spill could put the brakes on petroleum exploration there and in other areas. But after Long Island law enforcement authorities waited a second day for Hazelwood to turn himself in, the Suffolk County district attorney's office announced there would be no surrender that day. Of about three dozen oil-soaked otters rescued following the spill, about one-third have died, Alaska Department of Fish and Game spokesman Jon Lyman said. Fishermen counting on the sound's $12 million annual herring industry were told Monday by the state that it will not allow a season this year. An effort at Sawmill Bay, 11 miles west of Valdez, to keep oil away from a hatchery where 2 million salmon are waiting to be released to the sea appeared to be failing.
