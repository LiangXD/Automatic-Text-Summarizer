"For some Shining Path experts, Morote might even be, in practice, the true leader of the organization." Abimael Guzman, a former professor of philosophy, founded the Shining Path movement and is generally recognized as its leader. The Shining Path is seeking to overthrow Peru's elected government and install a peasant and worker state patterned after the ideas of Mao Tse-tung. Deputy Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla said Morote was arrested before dawn Sunday at a house in downtown Lima along with two women. Mantilla said Morote had fake identification papers but was identified by his fingerprints. Counterinsurgency sources said police raided the house after neighbors told them of suspicious behavior by the people living there. The Shining Path devoted itself to 10 years of semi-clandestine political work with peasants in the impoverished Andean highlands before taking up arms. Counterinsurgency sources said Morote's capture will create a power vacuum within the central committee of the Shining Path and spark tension until a replacement is found. But most counterinsurgency experts believe that Guzman, described as brilliant by his former professors, is still alive.
