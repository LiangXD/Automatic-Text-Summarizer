END SUMMARY Although La Republica, a prominent anti-Fujimori daily, provided little information on the origins of the important and unusual document that it published in a special 25 January supplement, it assured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining the Shining Path's struggle for a peace agreement was a genuine Shining Path statement. The paper claimed that the anonymous sources who supplied the secret document provided full authentication and that experts consulted by the paper also agreed that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman (La Republica, 26 January).(See Note 1) (Note 1) La Republica did not assert that the document was actually signed by Guzman. However, the paper did claim that the document was approved by imprisoned Shining Path Central Committee members Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo, Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Marta Huatay Ruiz, Maria Pantoja Sanchez and Rosa Angelica Salas de la Cruz (25 January). (Note 3) For example, in his presentation of the video recording of Guzman's first call for peace talks, Fujimori claimed that the Shining Path political leadership has tacitly admitted that the Peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in confronting the Shining Path (Lima Radio and TV, 4 October 1993). At the same time, however, by concluding that the published strategy statement is merely the Shining Path's declaration of temporary retreat, the daily has raised new questions about the credibility of Fujimori's claim that the call for peace represents a victory for the government. While such doubts are unlikely to seriously affect Fujimori's prospects for reelection next year, they may have further tarnished the image of the Peruvian president, already damaged by his narrow victory in the constitutional referendum last October.
