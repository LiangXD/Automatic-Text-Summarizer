The Senate voted one answer and, in effect, invited the Supreme Court to decide whether it was right or wrong. Nobody is certain because counting illegal aliens is a hard thing to do, given the fact that they don't want to be spotted by the government. Then again, the Census Bureau maintains that not including them, and still coming up with an accurate 1990 population count, would be even more difficult. "A census of only legal residents cannot be done as accurately as a census of all residents," according to Census Bureau testimony to Congress. After the 1980 census, the government estimated that there were 2.57 million people in the United States illegally. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., proposed, and won, the immigration bill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the redistricting process. It would give Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher the assignment of adjusting the census figures so that illegal aliens don't count for purposes of redistributing House seats. That task would be perilous politically, since it would involve taking House seats away from some states and giving them to others, all on the basis of estimates. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said it was unconstitutional, as well as unworkable. Neither the original article nor the amendment mentions citizenship in connection with apportionment, although the term "citizens" is used in some other provisions. Opponents of the amendment said that showed the authors of both documents wanted everybody counted for purposes of apportionment. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., said the people who wrote the documents had no concept of illegal aliens because there weren't any in their time. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said the question should be put squarely to the Supreme Court. "Then, for the first time, we will let the Supreme Court of the United States decide something that we need an answer to..."
