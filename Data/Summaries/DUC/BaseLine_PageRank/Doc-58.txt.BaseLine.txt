President Bill Clinton's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it' was one of the most popular lines in last year's election campaign. In the American mind, welfare has become synonymous with such evils as urban decay, fatherless children, drug abuse and violent crime. By promising radical welfare reform, Mr Clinton was sending a powerful subliminal message: he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban society. Since becoming president, Mr Clinton has barely mentioned the word welfare, raising fears that his grandiose promise will prove as cynical as former President George Bush's 'read my lips: no new taxes' pledge. It claims both measures will help shift people off welfare by 'making work pay.' This gives poor working families a cash bonus of up to Dollars 2,500 a year, increasing the incentive to take low paid jobs. In addition, the administration promises to bolster the economic position of welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to support their children financially. Once people accept that benefits are not going to be paid indefinitely, they argue, behaviour will change. Those whose welfare benefits expire will face a stark choice: accept low-paid employment or hand over children for adoption. At first the adjustment will be horribly painful but in the longer term society will gain enormously because destructive lifestyles will no longer be underwritten. With its economic life support system (welfare) ripped away, the underclass will shrivel. According to one advocate, this would amount to replacing the welfare state by the 'work ethic state'. Like Mr Bush, Mr Clinton may have raised expecta-tions that simply cannot be met.
