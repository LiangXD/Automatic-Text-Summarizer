A major earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter scale struck off northeastern Honshu Island early today, officials said. Three coastal villages were ordered evacuated for fear of tidal waves, officials said. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the quake, which struck at 3:26 a.m. After the quake, officials closed the major expressway through the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were stopped to check the condition of the rails. Officials ordered the evacuation of the villages of Taro, Sanriku and Ozutsu, about 300 miles northeast of Tokyo on Honshu's eastern coast. In Washington, the U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured 7.3 on the Richter scale. U.S. Geological Survey scientists said they recorded an aftershock measuring 5.8 about 10 minutes after the main quake.
