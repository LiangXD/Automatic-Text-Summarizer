"We're certainly not happy to have an incident like this occurring, but we need all the information," said Councilman Thomas J. Clark of the council's request for an investigation. Don Jackson, said he set up the self-styled "sting" in Long Beach to expose alleged police racism in the Los Angeles area. An NBC-TV news camera crew arranged to follow Jackson during the sting Saturday night. "We've never been able to come forth before with enough evidence (of alleged police racism). "We will pursue it aggressively," said Long Beach City Manager James Hanklad. Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said on NBC's "Today" show this morning that he was disturbed by the videotape. Long Beach, about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, has about 450,000 people, including a sizeable black population. The NBC-TV videotape shows a white officer attempting to search Jackson. The idea first was debated last year amid allegations of police brutality. But Jackson's boss said the black officer was looking for trouble. Jackson alleges racist slurs and actions forced him from the Hawthorne department. "I already cooperated and told him he could search me," Jackson said. "I'm more so offended since the Hawthorne Police Department, which has no jurisdiction, is making judgment." David Lynn of the referral service said 50 misconduct complaints were filed with his group against the Long Beach police. Of those, 27 were filed by minorities, and 24 of those involved confrontations with white officers.
