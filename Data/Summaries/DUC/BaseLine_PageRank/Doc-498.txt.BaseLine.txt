President Reagan says he's just guessing along with everybody else. Reagan also was asked about a newspaper column suggesting his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, as a possibility for the second spot on the ticket. "You'd better watch out," the president quipped. Fitzwater's daily briefings are piped into the offices of top White House aides. Later, as Reagan bade farewell to visiting Icelandic Prime Minister Thorsteinn Palsson in the White House East Room, the question came up again. Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, responding to a reporter's query, nodded toward Powell and said with a grin, "He's my candidate." Despite the jesting tone of the questions and answers, it's not just a joke. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., who is himself a potential vice presidential candidate, is among those who have mentioned Powell as a possible Bush running mate. I say it right up front _ I will be vice president. Fitzwater was Bush's press secretary before taking his present job.
