"The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid," Grindberg said. "The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and chemicals and tires, they got paid. What I'm saying is, the farmer got the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited." The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 million into North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state. The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many say it also kept the state afloat. "I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area," Grindberg added. More than 49,000 producers shared $410.2 million _ about 10.5 percent of the total package. But drought aid cut farmers' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a North Dakota State University study found. Disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banks and households from $3.4 billion to $2.1 billion, the study said. Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been just $6,300. Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into Iowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said. "From '81 through '86, the bottom pretty much fell out of everything," said Greg Schulz, who farms about five miles from Grindberg. Good crops the next two years started to reverse the trend, but drought stalled the recovery. "We didn't get that in '89," he added, referring to continuing drought in North Dakota's west and south-central sections. In fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12 months ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988's estimated $530 million, Aakre said. Cass County also had a better 1989 crop but expects higher losses in crop dollars. About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms in Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres. Wheat, corn, barley, soybeans, sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grown here. "You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is going to be," he said. Next year, we're going to have to start coming around to a profit." Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley, was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance. His 1989 crop was better but still below normal; he expects to get only $3,000 in relief payments.
