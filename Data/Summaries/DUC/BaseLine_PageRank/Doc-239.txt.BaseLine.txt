The expectation is that growth in US exports to Mexico and Canada will outpace growth in imports from its neighbours to the north and south. Most Wall Street economists are pro-Nafta, as are the majority of business leaders, if recent polls are to be believed. By coincidence, the day after next week's Nafta vote, Clinton will be in Seattle for a trade conference with leaders of Asian Pacific Nations. If he arrives there fresh from defeat on Nafta, the President's authority on trade issues will be compromised. Many economists argue that the competitive forces unleashed by the accelerating collapse of international trade barriers have helped restrain global inflation. Low worldwide inflation has kept bond yields at historic lows, which in turn have boosted share prices to record highs in many markets. On paper, this should not be a particularly difficult task, because Congress is controlled by Democrats. Anti-Nafta forces have warned that opening up trade with Mexico will lead to a migration of American jobs south of the border, where wages are much lower. Because the domestic labour market remains weak, this line has struck a strong chord with ordinary Americans. Whether this helped swing the votes of some anti-Nafta legislators the Clinton administration's way remains to be seem.
