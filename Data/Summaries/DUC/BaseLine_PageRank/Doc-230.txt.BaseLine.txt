Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia, De Beers' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa's borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe. This year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so that the CSO is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to take from producers. However, there is still turmoil in the diamond market, caused by uncertainty about Russian exports following 'leaks' of stones from that country outside its contract with the CSO. Consequently, Mr Hans Gastrow, general manager, says that this year Venetia will process 4.3m tonnes of ore, 6.5 per cent below its capacity. It is also mining an area of lower grade ore, which has fewer diamonds in each tonne. Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at full production. Last year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output and processed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats. Mr Gastrow says that, apart from the imposition of the CSO quota, Venetia 'has made a remarkably smooth transition from construction to production'. The total has been kept down here partly by highly automated process plant but also by 'fewer people employed just to see that other people are doing their jobs', according to Mr David Gadd-Claxton, ore extraction manager.
