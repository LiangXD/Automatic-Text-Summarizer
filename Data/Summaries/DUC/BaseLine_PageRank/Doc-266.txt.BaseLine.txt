The president, who leaves office July 28, said the newly formed People's Defense Revolutionary Movement, is the "urban, metropolitan organ of the Shining Path." At least 18,500 people have been killed in political violence related to the decade-old insurgency, which was launched in the Andean highlands. The Shining Path draws much of its support from indigenous peoples resentful of the economic and political dominance in the country of 22 million of descendants of European immigrants. The wave of violence comes four days before a presidential runoff that pits novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, a free-market activist, against centrist agricultural engineer Alberto Fujimori. In one of the guerrilla safehouses raided in an upper-class Lima suburb, police found tons of Shining Path documents and propaganda. In other violence Wednesday in Lima, a city of 6 million, four rebels armed with machine guns took over a neighborhood electoral office. Guerrillas blew up at least three high-tension power pylons Tuesday night, blacking out parts of the capital and other coastal cities where most of Peru's 22 million people live. Tuesday's car bomb went off behind Lima's Roman Catholic cathedral, which faces the main plaza where the Government Palace is located.
