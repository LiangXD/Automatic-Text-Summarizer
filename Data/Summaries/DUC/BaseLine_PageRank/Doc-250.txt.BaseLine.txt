But following an embargo by Serbia on Slovene imports in 1990, and ensuing war in neighbouring Croatia last year, Slovene exports to the former Yugoslavia have fallen to 15 per cent of that previously. Unemployment has risen to 101,000, up from 9 per cent to 11 per cent of the labour force. Inflation was running at 25 per cent a month last October, but by April it had fallen to 5 per cent. 'We have recently signed bilateral trade agreements with Croatia and Macedonia,' said Mr Horvath. In the meantime, Slovene enterprises, particularly those in the furniture, electronics, paper, and white goods sector, are exporting to European Community countries.
