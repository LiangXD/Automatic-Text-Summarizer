Similar alarms are likely to be sounded today when Sen. Hawkins: The cost of living has gone up tremendously since the minimum wage was last raised. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio): We haven't adjusted it for inflation for a number of years and the issue needs our attention. The labor federation has made the issue a legislative priority, arguing that an increase is long overdue. He and others concede that increases in the minimum wage do result in some job losses. But they contend the extent is overstated, and partly offset by new jobs created by stimulated economic growth. His research shows that income from the minimum wage was enough to raise a family of three out of poverty during most of the 1960s and 1970s. But many business groups think the consequences of another increase will be dire. It would cost jobs... drive up prices and decrease services, asserts Mark de Bernardo, manager of labor law for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber claims that 644,000 jobs were lost as a result of the last minimum-wage increase. Employers say they'd have to raise wages for other workers, and costs would inevitably be passed on to the consumer. There were 70,000 small-business failures last year, says Mr. de Bernardo. Jerry Goodwin, president of Reese Coffee Houses in Denver, sees nothing but harmful effects. I let those four people go and those four jobs have been lost forever, he says. Higher labor costs force employers to cut corners, and service suffers. Hawkins: There's something wrong with a small business that needs this substandard wage to survive. Mr. Levitan's research shows that nearly 30% are heads of households and about the same number are teenagers. Thus the chamber's Mr. de Bernardo says arguments about family poverty are misleading. It is not the head of the household who is earning minimum wage, he says. Considerations include what, if anything, might be palatable to the White House and what would draw enough support to override a veto.
