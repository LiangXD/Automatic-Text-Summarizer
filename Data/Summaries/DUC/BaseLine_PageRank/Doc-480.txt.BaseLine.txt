Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that would raise the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1992. "This is an excellent opportunity for Congress and the administration to demonstrate that they can work together and in doing so achieve a fair increase in the minimum wage and an honest training wage," Kennedy said. Sponsors of the House bill, while disputing GOP projections of massive job losses, added a provision allowing a sub-minimum wage to be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job. That falls far short of the White House demand and, with Kennedy also opposed to Bush's training-wage proposal, that issue likely will be a major sticking point in any attempts to reach a compromise. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., said during an unsuccessful GOP effort to substitute Bush's proposal for the House leadership's measure. But Democrats argued they had given enough by cutting the final increase from $4.65 an hour to $4.55 and by adding the new-hire wage. As amended, the House bill would boost the minimum wage to $3.85 an hour on Oct. Current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less than $362,000 from the minimum-wage law; the House bill increased that level to $500,000.
