They met in Mr. Steger's tent, shared tea and their Antarctic dreams and exchanged phone numbers. But why would anyone back a trip to the South Pole, where all the firsts seemed to have been garnered long ago? Norwegian Roald Amundsen had been there first, followed a month later by British Royal Navy Capt. More Britishers had crossed Antarctica with tracked vehicles in 1958 and 1981. Because their lives depended on the dogs, the men knew them all intimately, their strengths and foibles. They were inspired by their canine colleagues and despaired when they sometimes wilted from exhaustion. Men and dogs stumbled forward in snowy whiteouts, fell into and rescued one another from crevasses. Bone-chilling head winds froze painful cracks in their fingers and faces, sapping the strength of men and dogs. Feared dead, he was found 13 hours later, 300 feet from his tent near a ditch he had scraped in the snow with a pair of pliers. Trans-Antarctica faced such problems with a different style than Amundsen, Scott, Ernest Shackleton and explorers who traveled in an age when leaders gave orders and the rest followed. Amundsen consulted his teammates but his leadership was authoritarian, and the Scott expedition followed Royal Navy traditions of command. As polar literature, Mr. Steger's account, written with Jon Bowermaster, cannot equal the technical fascination of Amundsen's The South Pole.
