Around the world, national theologies are crumbling: communism, apartheid and, here in America, the worship of guns -- to foreigners, the single craziest thing about us. There was retired Chief Justice Warren Burger preaching sacrilege on the cover of Parade magazine a couple of weeks ago. Most right thinkers take comfort in that funny stuff about the militia. Since the amendment's stated purpose is arming state militias, they reason, it creates no individual right to own a gun. But would civil-libertarians be so stinting about an amendment they felt more fond of? But liberals reject the notion that free speech is therefore limited to political topics, even broadly defined. I'm not sure this is as clinching an argument as Kates seems to think. The phrase right of the people appears four other times in the Bill of Rights (including the First Amendment). In all these other cases, everyone agrees that it creates a right for individual citizens, not just some collective right of states as a whole. He adds that they must be light enough for an ordinary person to carry ( bear ), and even that they can't be especially dangerous or unusual. This list seems quite reasonable and moderate, though where it all comes from is not clear. It would be remarkable indeed if none of the Bill of Rights became less sensible and more burdensome with time. Talking and writing are as central to American democracy as they ever were; shooting just isn't. Gun nuts are unconvincing (at least to me) in their attempts to argue that the individual right to bear arms is still as vital to freedom as it was in 1792.
