Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) -- The Sunday Review television program said that according to a very reliable source, the end of the popular war, the surrender of weapons, and a general amnesty, would be the main points of a peace agreement without victors or vanquished, between the Shining Path and the Peruvian Government. The administration of President Alberto Fujimori has admitted that talks, led by Abimael Guzman who has been serving a life sentence since October 1992, are being held between government representatives and Shining Path leaders in prison. Another point refers to dismantling the People's Guerrilla Army with their surrender and the destruction of their weapons.
