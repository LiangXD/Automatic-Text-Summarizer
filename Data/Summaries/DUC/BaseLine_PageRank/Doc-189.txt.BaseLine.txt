But this year's batch did not include the devastating storms of years past and at least one forecaster thinks 1991 will be a calmer year. Dr. William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, thinks a dry spell in West Africa during the past two decades explained the reduction of storms along the eastern seaboard in the last 20 years. In 1988 and 1989, there was near normal rainfall in the Sahel, the semi-arid land on the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert. Some meteorological experts think the rainfall signaled the end of a 20-year drought - and may have spawned Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo in 1989. But Gray and other forecasters agree that the general outlook for the 1990s and the early years of the next century is for more intense hurricanes than those of the last two decades. Hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic every month except April, but are rare outside the hurricane season, June 1 to Nov.
