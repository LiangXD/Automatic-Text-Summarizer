The Coast Guard also said there were unconfirmed reports that two others had been picked up by another boat. Rescue divers, however, were unable to search the overturned service vessel for survivors because of increasingly strong winds and high waves. The 72-foot service vessel, leased to the Chevron Corp. by the Avis Bourg Co., capsized about 25 miles south of Morgan City, La. Late Monday afternoon, Chantal was about 200 miles south-southeast of Galveston, Tex., traveling northwest at about 10 m.p.h. Meanwhile, coastal residents began what has long been a ritual along the Gulf Coast during hurricane season, which begins in late spring and runs through early fall. Grocery stores began reporting a steady demand for hurricane staples -- bottled water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows. In that event, the Houston area would have extensive flooding, said Bill Evans, flood watch director for the Harris County Flood Control District.
