"It is expected that this will be the case for all lightly oiled Gulf of Alaska sites," said the two-part, 60-page report. "We are going to have to take a hard look at that," responded Bill Lamoreaux, the ranking state environmental official monitoring the cleanup. Since March 24, when an Exxon tanker struck a reef outside Valdez and poured more than 10 million gallons of North Slope crude into Prince William Sound, Exxon has financed cleanup crews fighting the spreading sludge. It covers polluted areas within Prince William Sound, as well as those outside the immediate spill zone, and calls for nearly 3,400 workers to participate in the cleanup. The worst areas _ three miles of sludge-covered beaches on several small islands _ would be targeted immediately, with the others scheduled for gradual cleansing through Sept. The gunk and sludge that resists treatment or salvage will be burned or buried, according to the Exxon study. Both methods likely will require exemptions from local environmental laws. Paul A. Yost Jr., the ranking federal official tracking the cleanup, told reporters in Sacramento, Calif. that he would decide whether to approve the proposal within a week. Before the plan was released, Yost said he wanted much more detail than Exxon's original cleanup plan, which included nothing on polluted areas outside the sound. The damage stretches along 260 miles of rocky, rugged coastline southwestward from Cape Douglas some 500 miles from Valdez, park superintendent Ray Bane said Monday. "The oil has made landfall in large quantities in Katmai Bay and Hallo Bay.
