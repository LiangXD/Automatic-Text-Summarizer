Only the autonomy talks with the Kurds are considered serious.; IRAQ; MONTHS OF SANCTIONS ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL; IRAQ'S economy was severely damaged by the war, and the trade sanctions imposed by the United Nations shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August are starting to take a toll.; Iraq is allowed to import food and medicine under the sanctions. But until it can export its oil, it will have little cash to obtain reasonably priced supplies of basic necessities.; Many of the goods coming into the country are being bought by private businessmen with hard currency they stockpiled before the war. They must in turn sell the goods at high prices to make a profit.; An ambassador from a Third World country, who spoke on condition of anonymity, predicted that if the sanctions were continued six more months it would increase the threat of internal unrest in Iraq.; President Bush has said the sanctions will remain as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. But so far, there is no clear alternative to Saddam.; In the meantime, government officials have told people to brace for the worst.; Iraqis line up for rationed food and gasoline and try to make ends meet by taking on second jobs.; The official exchange rate for the Iraqi dinar is $3.20. The damage is everywhere: in air, water, earth and fire.; Smoke and soot continue to pour from hundreds of oil wells set ablaze by the fleeing army of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.; KUWAIT; WAR-RAVAGED NATION IS SLOW TO REBUILD; KUWAIT is lacking in leadership, stripped of its workforce, gutted of supplies and apparently in little hurry to do anything about it.; Hundreds of homes, shops, offices, schools and power plants have been looted -- but not leveled. About half the old workers were foreigners, especially Palestinians, who either fled the country during the war or have been ordered by the Kuwaiti government to stay off work because of alleged Iraqi sympathies. This includes the Patriot missiles that were used to counteract Iraqi Scud attacks, though questions have arisen about just how effective the Patriot was in actually destroying Scuds.; But while establishing the prowess of American aircraft and missiles, the war did little to answer questions about Army hardware, including the M-1 tank and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.; Also untested were the Marine Corps' new machines for amphibious attack -- large air-cushion hovercraft designed to carry troops and heavy equipment from ship to shore. While the threat of a landing tied down six Iraqi divisions defending the Kuwait coast, there was no amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf.; REFUGEES; KURDS HEADING BACK TO HOMES IN NORTH IRAQ; RAGGED and weary, Iraqi refugees are returning home at the rate of 10,000 a day.; Roughly 1.7 million of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds fled to Iran and Turkey during civil uprisings in late March and early April. Six other camps were emptied in recent days.; Figures are sketchy, but the allied command estimates that fewer than 10 percent of 450,000 Kurds who fled to the Turkish border are still displaced.; But there are no accurate assessments of what has happened to 1.2 million more Kurds who settled in Iranian camps.
