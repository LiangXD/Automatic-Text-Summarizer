Ms. Issajenko, who also competed in the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, was quoted as saying she also took the muscle-building drug. 2. Later, her husband Tony said Ms. Issajenko denied saying she and Johnson took steroids. The Toronto Star said Sunday that it stood by its story. "I just don't care any more," Ms. Issajenko was quoted as saying. Francis, meanwhile, has said the test result "defies all logic" and could only be explained "by deliberate manipulation of the testing process." After Johnson tested positive for steroids at the Olympics, Ms. Issajenko said therapist Waldemar Matuszewski had "tampered" with her and Johnson. The story was called "nonsense" by Canadian Olympic track physician Dr. Robert Luba and Issajenko later retracted her charges against Matuszewski. The federal government has appointed Ontario Associate Chief Justice Charles Dubin to head a judicial inquiry into the Ben Johnson affair.
