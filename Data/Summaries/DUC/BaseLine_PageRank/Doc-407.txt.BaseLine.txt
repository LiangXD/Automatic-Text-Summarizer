Stores and offices closed, apparently out of fear of attacks, when what was intended to be a blockade of transport turned into a general strike. Groups of about 50 demonstrators staged sit-down strikes at about two dozen rail and road intersections in and around Dhaka, a city of 7 million people. Even bicycle-powered rickshaws, Dhaka's chief mode of transport, stayed off the streets. United News of Bangladesh said 4,000 police and paramilitary troops were deployed in Dhaka. At least eight people have been killed by police since the current round of protests started Oct. This shows popular support for our cause," said Suranjit Sengupta, a top leader of the Democratic Party.
