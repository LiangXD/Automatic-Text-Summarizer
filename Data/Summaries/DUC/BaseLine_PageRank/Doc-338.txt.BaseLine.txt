About 800 American tourists traveled to Antarctica in 1988, 3,000 in 1989, and tour operators expect at least 4,000 in the December-February summer season. "There's clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary visits to remote places in the world," said Manheim. "We are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to Antarctica, we just think tourism is something that has to be regulated carefully," he said. Particularly worrisome to critics are the plans of Ocean Cruise Lines of Fort Lauderdale to send the largest cruise ship in years to Antarctica, the 460-passenger Ocean Princess. Rates begin at $3,895 per person for a double-occupancy cabin on its three wine-and-caviar cruises, which are selling briskly. He said ships had made repeated tourist visits to the same wildlife sites, disrupting the breeding of seals, penguins and other birds. "A year after Antarctica's most significant environmental disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar catastrophes," said Manheim. "We have tried, and we believed we have dealt succesfully with the explosion of Antarctica tourism," said Jack Talmadge of the National Science Foundation, which regulates U.S. activities in Antarctica. Talmadge said the NSF has issued tourist regulations, established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and taken steps to limit visits to U.S. research stations. Although 16 nations fly flags in Antactica and seven claim slices of it, no nation holds title to the continent, which is larger than the United States and Mexico combined. Military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists have been frequent modes of travel to Antarctica since the first tourists visited in 1958.
