President Reagan's national security adviser, Colin Powell, on Thursday credited Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev for pushing economic reform, but said it "remains to be seen" how much improvement can be made under a communist, one-party system. Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet legislature that Gorbachev's government is finding it difficult to bring deficit spending under control. In his speech, Powell took his audience on a tour of world trouble spots, saying resistance forces fighting communism and totalitarians have made great strides in Afghanistan, Angola, and Cambodia. He said a principal lesson to be learned from the various regional conflicts is that American foreign policy has tended to succeed in instances in which U.S. support was unquestioned. He said this included Afghanistan, where the Soviets have begun pulling out forces that have occupied the Southwest Asian nation since 1979 but were fought continuously by the Mujahedeen resistance. Of the changing political climate in the Soviet Union, he said: "Essentially, perestroika is an acknowledgment of the failure of the Soviet system to provide for its people. 20. "We can encourage steps that are clearly improvements in Soviet internal political practice, even if they do not correspond fully to what we know as democracy." Reagan on Wednesday voiced hope that Gorbachev would free remaining political prisoners in the Soviet Union _ as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had indicated following talks with Kremlin officials.
