The takeover was the most chaotic, incredible situation I've been involved in, said regulator Keith Seibold. Mr. Seibold, a 20-year veteran of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., has been in the first wave of regulators in many a bank seizure. He explained that Lincoln's files were spread among two buildings used by Lincoln and by American Continental Corp., the parent company. In sorting out what belonged where after the takeover, Lincoln's files were returned to Lincoln's building. Mr. Seibold wouldn't speak to reporters about Mr. Keating's version of the events.
