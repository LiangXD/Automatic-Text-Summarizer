Entomologists did not want their bugs sucked up by big fans. Now suddenly they had to devise ways to keep the wild world in. But a pair of hummingbirds need the nectar of 3,200 flowers a day for energy. Scientists had to be sure there would be that many in bloom every day of the year. At the outset, no one thought what would happen to the airtight bubble with the air heating up and expanding during the day. So the engineers devised external, inflatable lungs that would store the excess until it cooled for return to the biosphere. With a closed water supply, engineers also had to devise exterior tanks to cool the liquid. Perhaps the most difficult design was Dr. Walter Addey's for the salt and freshwater marshes. But Walter said that's not so great because we need them for the fish. So they put up signs that said don't swat the mosquitoes." "The earth has its problems," says Carl Hodges of the University of Arizona who designed the human habitat. "We've got acid rain problems, dirty air problems, and we've got carbon dioxide increasing at an alarming rate. Right now we don't have a research tool where we can control the global parameters, like CO2 and the quality of the atmosphere. Dr. Peter Warshall of the University of Arizona patterned the savanna grasslands after those of South America, Australia and Africa. Plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands in Biosphere II. In all, some 3,800 species of plant and animal life are being invited to the party, and as in the original Eden, snakes. Of almost as much interest as the individual biomes are the ecotones or tension areas where one biome yields reluctantly to the next. The idea was further developed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margolis, who postulated, after Darwin, that the environment helps mediate species variation. Biosphere II may teach mankind enough so it does not suffer the same fate.
