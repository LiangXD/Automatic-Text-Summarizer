But Labour's proposed minimum wage would only be positively harmful if, as the Tories claim, it will reduce employment. All of them are, at best, semi-educated guesses; and probably not worth the effort. No-one knows whether, or how, introducing a statutory minimum wage would affect unskilled wages and employment. The US, in particular, also has a large and highly competitive service sector employing many women and young people at relatively low wages. Its unemployment rate rose from 11.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent between 1974 and 1983, of which over one third is estimated to be a direct result of the rise in the minimum wage. A third of them had also been surveyed the previous December, before the higher federal minimum wage came into effect in April. Over half of the restaurants had to raise the lowest wage they paid by the full 45 cent increase in the minimum wage. Only 5 per cent of restaurants were already paying more than the new minimum. But the result is not more skilled employment, as Labour would have us believe. Moreover, the same argument would not apply to internationally competitive industries; a similar study of textile companies could well give the more conventional result.
