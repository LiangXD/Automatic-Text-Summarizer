The 31-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it underwater, will cut the London-Paris journey from six hours to three, as fast as a scheduled airline. For the British, the change wrought by what many call the "chunnel" will be enormous. "They're still arguing about whether it will introduce rabies into this country, or let in terrorists." "They discuss it in terms of their being an island race, with a channel that has kept out invaders," she said in an interview. State-owned British Rail will not commit itself to building a high-speed link from London to the tunnel in time to make the three-hour journey a reality in 1993. Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium that will own the tunnel, is urging British Rail to speed its plans. The consortium forecasts 16.5 million passengers in 1993 but the railroad says that figure will not be reached before 1998. Arriving channel trains will terminate at Waterloo station in south London, at a large customs and immigration terminal. Critics say this will waste time and Britain should follow the continental practice of handling such matters on the train during the journey. British stations, bridges and tunnels are not built for the tall loads commonly carried across the channel. That means many loads will have to be repacked or transferred to trucks unless the facilities are rebuilt. Digging began in 1882 but was halted by British fears of French invasion through the tunnel. With trade barriers among the 12 EEC countries set to fall in 1992, Colin Kirkland, technical director of Eurotunnel's on the British side, says the tunnel will be completed this time. "There's no way that politicians will cancel this project," Kirkland said in an interview. The tunnel, 80-130 feet below the seabed, was 2 miles into the channel from this end Oct. Once the all-clear is given, the two-story-high rotating blade with its tungsten teeth resumes chewing ahead.
