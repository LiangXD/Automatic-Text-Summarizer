The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who dominate Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region. With a system they call "revolutionary justice," they have banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery from the villages they control. Shopkeepers say the guerrillas never fail to pay for the food and supplies they acquire in the villages. The same shopkeepers complain bitterly about the local police who take what they want without ever offering to pay. "In a sense they enforce a hyper-Christian morality _ except they kill you if you break the rules," said the Rev. Paul Feeley, a Canadian Roman Catholic priest working in Aucayacu, 255 miles northeast of Lima. A few months earlier the rebels executed eight youths near Tingo Maria for smoking cigarettes laced with semi-refined cocaine. "People have had to discipline themselves," said Raul Aranda, an agronomist in Tingo Maria, explaining the effects of "revolutionary justice." "In rural areas a man must be faithful to his wife and is permitted to go drinking only once a week. Villagers say they are told, "The revolution has a thousand eyes and a thousand ears." Although they prohibit drug consumption, the guerrillas defend coca production as an important source of income for the peasants. Their only condition is that the semi-refined coca paste be sent out of Peru. The Colombians arrive in small planes at dozens of clandestine airstrips throughout the 150-mile-long valley. They say they feel protected from the violence of drug gangs, corrupt local officials and "abusive" police. He gets off the plane from Lima with his hand out for a payoff."
