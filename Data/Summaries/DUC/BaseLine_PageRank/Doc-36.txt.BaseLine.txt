Scientists missed by 150 years in dating the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tablet that also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researchers said today. Scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse, recorded on a clay tablet found in Syria, occurred on May 3, 1375 B.C. But in today's issue of the British journal Nature, two Dutch scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened about 150 years later, on March 5, 1223 B.C. One side appears to tell of a solar eclipse, and the reverse side reads, "Two livers were examined: danger." In an accompanying editorial, Christopher B.F. Walker of the British Museum in London cautioned that their conclusion "can best be regarded as a plausible hypothesis."
