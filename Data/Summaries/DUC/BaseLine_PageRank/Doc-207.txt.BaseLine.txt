TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the "Chunnel" said the historic linkup occurred at 8:25 p.m. Tuesday when British workers sent a probe 2 inches in diameter through to their French colleagues. It also fulfills a dream of Napoleon, who wanted to send his armies through the tunnel to conquer Britain. Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium overseeing the world's largest engineering project, plans for high-speed trains to pass through the Channel Tunnel in June 1993. Despite her countrymen's fears of losing their ancient moat against Europe, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher described the breakthrough as "a very exciting moment." In London, the conservative Daily Express newspaper noted today that Britons will be able to walk to France for the first time since the Ice Age. Champagne corks popped and workers danced jigs after French drillers phoned news of the probe's arrival to their British counterparts. Initial tests indicated the two halves were 20 inches out of alignment. Technicians will be more certain Wednesday, but they called the rough line-up "exceptional." Tunnelers are expected to walk through and greet each other with handshakes in a few weeks. The other two will handle rail traffic - freight and special piggy-back trains that will carry passengers and cars. Since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been seven accidental deaths on the British side and two on the French side. The digging is accomplished by gargantuan boring machines that bring to mind images from Japanese monster movies. Each resembles a gnawing worm, some three-stories high, with a spinning drill of hundreds of blades. Mechanical legs slap together the concrete tunnel lining in the wake of the advancing drill head.
