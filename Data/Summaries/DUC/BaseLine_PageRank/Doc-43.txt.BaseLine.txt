A Although television networks were pushing to have the eclipse in prime time, nature refused to cooperate. You shouldn't look at the sun through film negatives, a camera viewfinder or sunglasses, either. But some astronomers warn that there is no guarantee that even these glasses will prevent eye damage.; Q Where is the best spot to experience the eclipse?; A Contrary to popular belief, you will not get a better sense of the eclipse on a mountaintop or from your roof. The major part of the shadow will fall mostly through Mexico and Hawaii, where it will get totally dark. By then, you may be able to shuttle to the moon and watch it from there.
