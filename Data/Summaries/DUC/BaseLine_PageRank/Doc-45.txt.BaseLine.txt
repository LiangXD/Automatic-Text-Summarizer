Rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced the beginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from April through June across Texas and other Tornado Alley states in the nation's heartland. From 1951 through 1986, there have been an average of 118 tornadoes in Texas per year, according to the state climatologist's office in College Station. More than 60 percent of those occur between April and June, records show. A few twisters were already recorded in early March in Texas but they did little or no damage. If they wait until it gets there, it's going to be too late," said Buddy McIntyre, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. Last May 22, a killer storm flattened the small West Texas town of Saragosa, killing 30 people and injuring 162. But there are some things you can do to protect yourself and property," said Laureen Chernow, a spokeswoman for the governor's division of emergency management. James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for Disaster Research at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly try to outrun tornadoes in their cars.
