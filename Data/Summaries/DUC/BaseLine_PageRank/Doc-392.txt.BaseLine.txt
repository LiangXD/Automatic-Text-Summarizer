The judgment of the Navy cruiser crew that mistakenly shot down the Iranian plane July 3 was clouded by misconceptions caused by stress, the psychologists said. Dr. Steven Zornetzer, representing the Navy's office of naval research, responded that the service does try to consider stress and is spending $12 million a year on basic research into psychological questions. While progess is being made, he said, "it must be clearly recognized that these research problems are among the most difficult and complex in the entire research spectrum." The hearing by the House Armed Services policy subcommittee was part of the panel's examination of the destruction of Iran Air Flight 655 that killed all 290 people on board. It was shot down by the cruiser Vincennes in the mistaken belief that the commercial jetliner was a military plane diving toward the Vincennes. The Navy said crew members, under battle-caused stress after just finishing a firefight with Iranian gunboats, misread or misinterpreted a variety of electronic data from the Aegis computers. "Expectations can color what people think they see, and what they remember, to a far greater degree than is recognized by common sense," Nisbett said.
