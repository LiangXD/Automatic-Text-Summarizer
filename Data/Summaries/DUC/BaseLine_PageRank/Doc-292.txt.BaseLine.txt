Although the annual average death toll for earthquakes is about 10,000, in 1987 only 1,100 lives were lost. The death toll of 25,000 is the most recent reported by the Soviets. That one occurred in January, however, and so does not count in the 1988 toll. That earthquake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale, destroyed thousands of homes and injured many people. The Survey said it recorded 61 significant earthquakes last year, 15 fewer than the year before. An earthquake is considered significant if it has a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale. Earthquakes of lesser magnitude are included if they cause casualties or considerable damage. Three significant earthquakes were recorded in the United States last year, including the strongest shock of the year. That earthquake, measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska and resulted in only minor damage. 25 was felt widely across that country and in the northeastern United States as far south as Washington, the Survey reported. 9. Injuries were also reported from two offshore earthquakes, one in the Ionian Sea near Greece Oct. And Japan, usually very seismically active, recorded only one significant earthquake last year, the Survey reported. That earthquake measured 5.4 and resulted in 10 injuries and minor damage in the Tokyo area.
