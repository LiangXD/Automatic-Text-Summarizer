Prospects for enactment of the first minimum-wage increase in eight years have improved sharply in recent days, sparked by Vice President George Bush's call for a boost in the wage floor. Wage-increase bills were languishing on Capitol Hill only two weeks ago, with many members of Congress reluctant to support a wage rise in the face of heavy small-business lobbying and arguments that the increase would mean job losses. A union official rated prospects for enactment as next to zero before the Bush remarks, but said they're now at least 50-50. The Senate took up the minimum-wage bill late last week, and backers and opponents alike said prospects are strong for Senate approval of the measure. Some conservative Southern Democrats were reluctant to vote for a minimum-wage increase and be left out on a limb by Senate inaction. But any Senate approval this week takes that argument away from them, said Jay Butler, a spokesman for the House Labor Committee. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), ranking minority member of the labor panel, that would allow employers to pay a training wage to new employees. The training wage, previously called a youth sub-minimum wage, has long been pushed by the Reagan administration, and Mr. Bush said he wants it too. But despite their dislike for the provision, some union officials indicate they might wind up accepting it, if they must, rather than let Republicans blame the Democrats for killing a minimum-wage increase. Reagan administration officials have indicated that any increase would have to be smaller than provided in the measures, and Mr. Bush takes that stand too.
