The projects range from four hotel-casinos to a downtown office building and a massive golf course and resort development. More than 380,000 Japanese tourists are expected to visit Las Vegas this year, vs. about 300,000 in 1988. Cosmo World has projects in Japan, Europe, Hawaii, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tucson. "If they come to the West Coast, we're going to get them," she said. The growing identity of Las Vegas in Japan, bargain real estate prices, a good economic climate and the attractiveness of the city are proving a magnet for Japanese investors. Cosmo World's resort project is expected to cost $200 million by the time it's completed in 1993. A group of Japanese investors have agreed to help Orlando, Fla. developer Bob Snow finance a $130 million dining and entertainment complex known as Winchester Station. The same source said the Japanese had taken over depressed properties and kept them open "and any stride forward is a positive sign." The Dunes and Aladdin had been operating under bankruptcy protection for years before they were purchased by Nangaku and Yasuda. The Park, the former Holiday Inn downtown, had been closed for five years before it was refurbished and opened by Manabe. Mike Rumbolz, former Gaming Control Board chairman who now heads Donald Trump's efforts to enter Nevada gaming, said the Japanese were hampered because they bought distressed properties that couldn't make it under American expertise. Sukeaki Izumi, who owns five hotels in Japan and Guam, recently purchased another closed property, the former Treasury Hotel, which he has renamed the San Remo. Izumi, who looked at properties in Hawaii but opted for Las Vegas because of the lower costs, has committed $30 million for the purchase and renovation of the hotel. When Nangaku bought the Dunes Hotel two years ago, his attorney predicted other Japanese businessmen would follow.
