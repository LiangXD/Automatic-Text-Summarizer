Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the winners weren't Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz. Ikangaa, who had captivated New Yorkers last year by winning in course-record time, and Waitz, who had won the race nine times, each ran fourth in their respective divisions. For Waitz, the result was different than anything she had experienced in New York. Since Waitz, of Norway, ran the marathon for the first time in 1978, no American has won the women's division. The last American men's winner was Alberto Salazar in 1982, when he took the title for the third time. Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., finished second among the women for the second consecutive year, five seconds behind Panfil to make it the closest finish in the race's 21-year history. Ken Martin of Dallas, the runner-up last year, failed to finish this time.
