Less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia to the brink of political chaos. Addressing President Virgilio Barco, the El Tiempo editorial said: "In your hands, and only in your hands, is the power to avoid the country's dissolution." He declined to be identified because he was afraid someone might be angered by his statements and kill him. Two other presidential candidates had already been assassinated during the campaign for May 27 elections. The media, citing security sources, reported that traffickers were the main suspects in Pizarro's killing as well. But the Medellin cartel denied involvement, and no government official has yet said who was responsible for Pizarro's assassination. On Saturday Antonio Navarro, a longtime guerrilla leader of the April 19 Movement, announced he would take Pizarro's place as candidate for president. For the first time, leading politicians suggested the government itself might be compromised by the killing. Former president Alfonso Lopez said the assassinations of three candidates indicated that Colombia's armed forces must be reorganized. Official investigations have shown that certain members of the armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the country's right-wing death squads. Through such reforms they hope to reform the corrupted Congress, strengthen the judicial system and provide more political representation for minority parties.
