Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday. It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis. There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the U.N. agency. Also, an estimated 1.7 billion individuals worldwide carry the organism but are not infectious to others. In these individuals, the organism can remain dormant without causing active disease for many years unless the immune system is somehow impaired. An individual does not have to have a damaged immune system to contract an active case of tuberculosis. In many places, more than half the beds in medical wards are patients with tuberculosis, Bloom said. But if they're not treated for tuberculosis, those people will be spreading the disease (tuberculosis) in their communities. Effective drugs to combat tuberculosis cost about $30 to $50 per person, given over six months.
