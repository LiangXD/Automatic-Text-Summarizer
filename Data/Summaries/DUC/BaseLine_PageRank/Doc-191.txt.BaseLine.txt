What would one of those legendary storms of the past with 200 mph winds pushing huge tidal surges do to this low-lying metropolis on the Atlantic? In this part of the world, technology has made obsolete such disasters as the unnamed hurricane that surprised Galveston, Texas, in 1900, killing 6,000 people.; The hurricane specialists use the nation's only working geostationary weather satellite to follow developing storms. About 20 of them intensify into stronger disturbances, ranging from tropical depressions, with wind speeds to 38 mph; to tropical storms, with winds from 39 to 73 mph; to hurricanes, with winds exceeding 74 mph.; Last year, 16 tropical depressions developed in the Atlantic. Fourteen became tropical storms, seven of which became hurricanes, fewer than usual.; People who venture into such dubious endeavors as long-term hurricane forecasting said this could be another light year. But, they said, a relatively quiet year does not guarantee a thing.; One such year was 1935 -- only six hurricanes formed, but one was the strongest to hit the continent. More than 800 workers, brought down to build the Overseas Highway through the Florida Keys, were killed when 200 mph winds knocked their evacuation train off the tracks.; NO MATTER what long-range forecasters say, scientists at the Hurricane Center know that the laws of probability are closing in on Miami. We would expect a major hurricane to hit within 75 miles of Miami every eight years. ; At the center, scientists built a computer model to calculate what would happen if the 1926 hurricane were to hit Miami today. Surging water could reach levels of 13 1/2 feet in low-lying areas south of Miami.; DESPITE MODERN technology, the specialists cannot forecast precisely where a hurricane will hit.
