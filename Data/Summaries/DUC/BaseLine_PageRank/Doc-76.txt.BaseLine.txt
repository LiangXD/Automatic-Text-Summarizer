A U.S. Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed and burned in Britain this morning while on a routine training flight. Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, originally identified the plane as an A-10 aircraft from the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Bentwaters, England. The Air Force later corrected that statement, saying the A-10 was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Alconbury. EST about four miles south of St. Ives, or about 25 miles north of Cambridge." "The pilot ejected and his chute was sighted but we don't know his status," Howard said. Nonetheless, today's crash comes just two weeks to the day after another A-10 slammed into the West German city of Remscheid, killing five and injuring dozens. That crash prompted the United States and its NATO allies to agree to suspend all A-10 flights over West Germany until Jan. 2. The suspension was ordered as German political parties and public interest groups increased their demands for an end to low-level flight training in Germany.
