Domestically, the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Internationally, it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans. On one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries. Actions such as that taken by Bank of Boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money-center banks. Management could use their reserve position to emphasize stength when competing for deposits and banking business against larger banks. Yesterday, Manufacturers Hanover announced a regular quarterly dividend of 82 cents a share, offering investors a yield of more than 13% annually. Other large New York banks also declined to disclose their plans, although a spokeman for Chase Manhattan Corp., said, We're obviously looking at it. Chase Manhattan skidded $2.25 to close at $20.125, Manufacturers Hanover fell $2.375 to $24.25, and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. was off $1.50 to $30. First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, the nation's 15th biggest banking concern, charged off $25.4 million in troubled foreign loans during the third quarter. First Chicago Corp., the 11th largest banking concern, charged off $48.9 million in Third World loans during the quarter. And even before the big reserves were set aside, banks were quietly charging off Latin debt, though on a smaller scale. Last March, Continental Illinois Corp. said it had charged off about half of its $100 million of loans to Peru.
