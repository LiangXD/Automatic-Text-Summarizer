Excepting the differences one would expect among independent thinkers, Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork are cut from the same judicial cloth. The attack on Clarence Thomas, which boggled tens of millions of viewing Americans, makes sense only if one understands that the roots of the struggle extend back to 1980 and Ronald Reagan's election to the presidency. Believing this to be true, opponents of the Reagan presidency then argued that his nomination of the like-minded Judge Bork was also illegitimate. And the public, by every measure available, gave Judge Thomas what in a normal election would be called their landslide support. This doesn't mean that the American people support Judge Thomas -- or Robert Bork or Ronald Reagan -- in every detail of their political beliefs. They have now given their consent in three successive presidential elections to a direction that can fairly be called conservative. It won't wait for the next election, nor -- more importantly -- will it make the effort to persuade the electorate to support its views of Supreme Court nominations. They'd rather fight their battles inside the Beltway, which lets them operate free of input from this nation's huge electorate. They can't possibly have wanted the sexual harassment charge against Clarence Thomas to go before the entire American population. Cut off from their support base, Judge Bork, Ed Meese, Oliver North and others have been left bleeding on the Washington fields. Washington's reporters, who had already largely broken away from the editorial controls of traditional journalism, even broke away from the congressional staffs and special-interest groups, building the sexual harassment story into a bonfire of personal and political grievances. Perhaps the voters felt they couldn't trust Washington or Congress with something important.
