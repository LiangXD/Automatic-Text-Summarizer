An official statement issued Friday confirmed that federal military commanders met in March and considered ways to quell dissent in Slovenia. The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followed reports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina that there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic. The police said "they had no available data which would justify such evaluations," according to the ministry statement. It reported the police also said there were no "subversive forces behind" articles carried in the Slovenian news media. Some army commanders have been increasingly critical of Slovenia's leadership, saying it should act firmly against political dissidents. The letter said military units would be used to crush demonstrations that were expected to be called to protest the arrests.
