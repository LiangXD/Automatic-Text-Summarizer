In thinly veiled comments in his resignation letter, Sununu made it clear that he felt betrayed because, in many ways, he was doing exactly what Bush had hired him to do.; The departing chief of staff was also obliquely reminding the president that this was not a matter of principle, but of ratings; his bullying tactics had been fine as long as the opinion polls did not go down.; I assure you that in pit bull mode or pussycat mode (your choice, as always), I am ready to help, Sununu wrote.; His reference was sardonic. He encouraged Bush to ride a snow plow and wander around a snow-bound Nashua, shaking hands and offering to help skeptical motorists dig out their cars.; On the surface, they seemed like an odd couple -- one tall, slim and patrician, the other short, pudgy and ethnic; one well-groomed, the other often slightly disheveled, with his shirt hanging out; one polite and conciliatory, the other rude and contentious.; But on matters of politics, George Bush and John Sununu were not so oddly matched. While Sununu's lack of political skill in dealing with political Washington eventually cost him his job, and while his fatal flaw may have been in believing that he was smarter than George Bush, the chief of staff was -- often in an inept way -- trying to fulfill the mandate he had been given by his boss.; Sununu was not proclaimed a failure from the start.
