1990 is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the nation. Ostby said 101 tornadoes touched down from Kansas to Kentucky, leaving nine people dead. As summer wears on, the land warms up and cold air from Canada retreats. This moves the boundary of the jet stream to the north, Ostby said. Flooding in the South and the Plains has been as destructive as the tornadoes. Authorities held out little hope for more than a dozen others listed as missing. Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5{ inches of rain in 3{ hours. The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40, officials said. An estimated 10,000 people were forced from their homes, and high water caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
