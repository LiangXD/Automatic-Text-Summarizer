President Quett Masire of Botswana said Thursday that industrial nations can help relieve drought and hunger in Africa by reducing global warming caused by the greenhouse effect. Experts believe that due to the organizing efforts of Masire's government, not one person died of drought-induced famine in Botswana. Through early planning, Botswana organized a nutritional surveillance and warning system and distributed food nationwide. "The semi-arid tropics will have even greater climatic variability as the warming continues," he said. "We would prefer to prevent droughts altogether rather than have to learn to deal with them well." The other Africa Prize-winner, Ouedraogo, has organized about 500,000 peasants in nine countries in Africa to develop their villages based on traditional cooperative village leadership.
