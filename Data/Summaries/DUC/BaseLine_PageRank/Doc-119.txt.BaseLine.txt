As often happens in law, a simple English sentence may have legal significance which determines the application of the words. The Second Amendment stated one of the subjects about which the federal government was prohibited from making any laws. The word people as used in constitutional law is used collectively and refers to a political entity, such as a state, and does not mean persons or individuals. There have been lower federal court decisions regarding the Second Amendment, all supportive of this established principle.
