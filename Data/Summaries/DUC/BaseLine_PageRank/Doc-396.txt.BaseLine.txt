More than 200 relatives of people killed when a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian airliner a year ago have sued the makers of the ship's radar system, a spokesman said Sunday. Nagib Ghafoor said the suit was filed June 28 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 of the 290 victims. The announcement of the lawsuit came on the eve of the July 3 anniversary of the 1988 tragedy, when an Iran Air Airbus was shot down by the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf. Vincennes crew members said they mistook the airliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter coming in to attack. "and other entities which designed and manufactured the radar equipment on board the USS Vincennes." The Iranian government has been seeking a World Court verdict against the United States and demanded financial compensation for the 290 dead.
