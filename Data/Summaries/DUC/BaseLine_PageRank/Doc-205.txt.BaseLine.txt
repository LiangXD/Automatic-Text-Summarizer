Nevertheless, after at least 20 false starts since 1802, the project to join England to Europe is irreversibly under way. Slow tractors are piling up walls of earth, cranes and pulleys hoist slabs of cast concrete through a jungle of rusting iron armatures. It looks like child's play, until you spot the men in hard hats: tiny beside their mechanical dinosaurs, they are the toys in the sandbox. Later, I get close to the toy chest, the construction camp in the shadow of Shakespeare Cliff, where nearly 1,000 of them live. Farthingloe Village -- a new concept in community living -- consists of 42 featureless blocks, spike-topped fencing, floodlights, security guards and warnings that All personnel may be searched on leaving the premises ; residents pay #45, or $80, a week. But the men staying here -- most of them migrant laborers from Ireland and northern England -- are rumored to earn as much as $1,750 a week. We few journalists, looking weedy as hell clutching our notebooks, trudge along in borrowed boots on a guided tour past some very large men (inwardly I take back all I thought, from the safety of the dewy green, poppy-sprayed ledge, about toys ). The total length of each tunnel will be 32 miles, 25 of which will be under the sea. Seven thousand British and 4,000 French workers, on eight- to 12-hour shifts, have completed more than half of the job. Of the three tunnels -- two big ones for trains and another for service -- the smallest is the most advanced: They've bored more than 27 miles. Many observers believe that, by doing nothing to improve the nation's creaking rail system, Britain will lose out on the full benefits of the Chunnel.
