The calm waters of Prince William Sound have stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in U.S. history, which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid chunks of ice, officials said. Coast Guard spokesman Ed Wieliczkiewicz said the use of chemicals to disperse and sink the heavy North Slope crude oil failed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up the oil. Early Friday the Exxon Valdez was losing 20,000 gallons of oil per hour, but the flow slowed to a trickle later. An oil slick snaked about five miles from the ship as wind and tide pushed the crude oil into the sound and away from shore. Dan Lawn, an engineer for the state Department of Environmental Conservation, said the captain could not steer the Exxon Valdez back on course in time to avoid a collision. In Washington, Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said efforts had begun to evacuate waterfowl, sea otters and other wildlife from the danger area. Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan said that, at the reduced rate, the marine terminal's capacity would allow nine days of operation before the line would have to be shut down. Valdez, a town of about 3,000 year-round residents that grows to more than 4,000 with a summer influx of fishing industry workers and travelers, is a picturesque community about 125 miles east of Anchorage. But the spill likely will draw increasing fire from environmentalists sensitive about the trans-Alaska pipeline and efforts to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. Valdez City Manager Doug Griffin said the 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline which carries oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez and the marine terminal have an enviable environmental record. 15, 1976, grounding of the Argo Merchant tanker off the Nantucket shoals off Massachusetts, in which 7.6 million gallons of oil spilled, Golob said.
