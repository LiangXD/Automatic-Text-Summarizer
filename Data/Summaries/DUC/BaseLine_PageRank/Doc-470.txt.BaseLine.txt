The results need to be replicated by other researchers before definitive conclusions can be made, and the long-term effect of the treatment remains unknown. But the initial experience with the compound is especially promising, and an apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease, scientists said. Dr. Estey recently began treating patients with 2-CdA and has had similar results with five patients. Hairy-cell leukemia, so-called because of the appearance of the cancerous cells under the microscope, affects about 6,000 people in the U.S., with 600 new cases a year. As the disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to infection and often need blood transfusions. Until the mid-1980s, treatments were ineffective, and patients often died of blood problems and infections. Since then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from hairy-cell leukemia. In the 12-patient study, 2-CdA, short for 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, was administered continuously for seven days to patients aged 36 to 61. People with that disease lack an enzyme that processes deoxyadenosine, a chemical that, without the enzyme, builds up in infection-fighting white blood cells and kills them. Since cancer patients have the enzyme, Scripps scientists developed a compound that mimics deoxyadenosine, but tricks the enzyme so it can't be processed. It's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments. About 50% to 60% of patients -- most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the drug, some with complete remission, he said.
