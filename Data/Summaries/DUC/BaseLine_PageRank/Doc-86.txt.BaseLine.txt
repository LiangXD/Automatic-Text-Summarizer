Tuberculosis is alarming health officials again because it's posing new health threats with its connection to the AIDS virus. In parts of Africa, where AIDS is already a health risk, tuberculosis has become epidemic, said Dr. Annik Rouillon, executive director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease in Paris. Snider also said doctors should administer TB tests to all persons testing positive for the HIV virus since TB may not be readily diagnosed in AIDS patients. Untreated, tuberculosis kills about 50 percent of its victims within two years, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Snider said sustained contact is necessary for TB transmission, and would not pose new problems for AIDS victims already fighting discrimination in jobs and housing. For the last three decades, it has been preventable and curable through multiple drug therapy, Snider said. If, however, a person's immune system is impaired by poor nutrition or weakened by the HIV virus, people can develop active TB. While associated with poverty and crowded living conditions, TB through history has ravaged both the poor and the famous. TB victims include Henry David Thoreau, Washington Irving, Franz Kafka, Ring Lardner, Somerset Maugham and Vivien Leigh. An estimated 3 million persons a year die worldwide from TB, according to the American Lung Association.
