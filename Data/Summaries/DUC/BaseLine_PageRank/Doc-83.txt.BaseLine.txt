The research found that when living conditions are identical, black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria. The relatively high rate of TB among blacks has traditionally been blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty. While social factors undoubtedly play a central role, the study suggests that innate susceptibility also contributes. "Whites seem to be more able to fend off the organism without it's ever being able to establish an infection." At the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. George Curlin called the findings "plausible and provocative." When they were retested at least two months later, 14 percent of blacks and 7 percent of whites showed evidence of new infections. Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that black inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the bacteria while incarcerated. An estimated 10 million Americans are believed to be infected with the bacteria but not sick. The disease, which attacks the lungs, has long been associated with poor, crowded living conditions. This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks. "This helps explain why black people are more susceptible to tuberculosis than are white people," said Crowle.
