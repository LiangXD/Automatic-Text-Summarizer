Suspected communist rebels today killed the police chief of the Philippines' major financial center in an escalation of street violence sweeping the capital area, police said. Col. Herminio Taylo, 54, police chief of Makati, had just finished jogging and was buying fruit in a public market when two assassins opened fire with.45-caliber pistols, police said. Lydio Zeta quoted witnesses as saying the gunmen shouted "We are NPAs," referring to the rebel New People's Army, and warned bystanders not to interfere. The military says communist rebels have killed up to 65 soldiers and police in the capital region since January. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, Capital Region commander, announced formation of a special task force to track down rebel assassins in the capital. President Corazon Aquino deplored the latest killing but said public officials must learn to live with the threat of assassination. National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto said the killing of Taylo showed that every soldier and policeman was a potential target of assassination.
