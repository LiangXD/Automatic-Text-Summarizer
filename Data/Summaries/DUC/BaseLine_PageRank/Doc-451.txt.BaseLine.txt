A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said.; If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said. (These volcanoes -- including Mount Lassen in Shasta County, and Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens in Washington, all in the Cascade Range -- arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another.); Pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980. But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash directly toward the base.; The volcano's activity -- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, Lipman said.; The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside.
