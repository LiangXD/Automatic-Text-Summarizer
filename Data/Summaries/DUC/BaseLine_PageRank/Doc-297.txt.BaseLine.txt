The airplane was attempting to land at nearby Coronado Airport, Porter said. It aborted its first attempt and was coming in for a second try when it crashed, he said. The bodies were taken to the Office of the Medical Investigator in Albuquerque. Walter Ramazzini Jr., 17, of Albuquerque, said he was sitting about 100 yards from the airplane when it crashed. "He was going east, making a left turn from the airport," Ramazzini said. "A gust of wind hit him from right to left. The wind made him bank to the left 30 degrees or so. The airplane "wasn't very high _ maybe 100 feet," Ramazzini said. "We went up there and there was nobody alive," Ramazzini said.
