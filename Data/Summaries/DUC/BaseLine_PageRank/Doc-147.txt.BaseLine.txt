Sometimes borrowers have to struggle against setbacks that might seem comical in the prosperous West. Undaunted, the women switched to chickens and made enough money selling eggs to branch out into tomatoes and tailoring, ultimately opening two shops, Ms. Leet says. Some Third World commercial banks are taking note of poor entrepreneurs' repayment rates. Accion persuaded family-owned Multi Credit Bank of Panama City, Panama, to start making microloans two months ago. When we got in touch with Accion, we were incredulous, Mr. Btesh says. CARE, New York, perhaps the world's largest private international-development group, says small economic-activity development -- primarily microlending -- is its fastest-growing portfolio. There's energy and creativity out there, people bootstrapping who aren't waiting for the next handout, says Larry Frankel of CARE. These people value access to credit so highly that default isn't really a problem, she says. Some Third World banks, notably in Asia, have been making microloans for years. However, most such banks were set up with state support specifically to target the poor. AID has more than doubled its micro-enterprise budget, which includes microlending, training and other activities, to an estimated $114 million this year from $58 million in 1988.
