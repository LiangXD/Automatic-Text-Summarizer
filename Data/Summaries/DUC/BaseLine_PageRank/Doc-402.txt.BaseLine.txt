On March 16, 1985, after playing an early morning tennis match with an AP colleague, Anderson was kidnaped from a Beirut street. Since then, both his father and his brother have died of cancer. He has never seen his daughter, who will turn 5 in June. But noticeably absent was any evidence that the hostages would be released soon. Asked by reporters Friday whether he had any optimistic news for the families of the hostages, Bush demurred. We don't have any breakthroughs we can report, added White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. She also said she had faith that all the hostages would be released in the coming weeks. The Lafayette Park ceremony was sponsored by No Greater Love, a Washington-based support group for the families of the hostages. Yellow flowers were placed beside the names of the nine Western hostages who are known to have been slain in Lebanon since 1985. Then, young children came forth, one by one, carrying photos of some of the Westerners who are still held hostage in Lebanon. In New York, Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. In Paris, former hostages Jean-Paul Kauffman and Roger Auque put on blindfolds and chained themselves to a tree outside the Iranian Embassy to protest Anderson's captivity. The two were among 10 French hostages released by their captors in Lebanon between 1986 and 1988. Meanwhile, in Damascus, former President Jimmy Carter met Friday with Syrian President Hafez Assad and also expressed optimism about the fate of the hostages. I see movement now... better chances than those I have seen for several years, Carter said. In Beirut, local television stations marked the anniversary of Anderson's capture by playing a videotape of his daughter, Sulome. The child was shown demonstrating her ballet dancing and told her father: I love you, Daddy.
