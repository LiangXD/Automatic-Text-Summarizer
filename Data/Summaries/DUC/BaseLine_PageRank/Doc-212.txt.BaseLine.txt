Most Southern Californians would agree that hills and canyons are among the most desirable places to live. Many of my clients lost property, but the fire jumped from house to house, then skipped others. The garden is landscaped into four plant zones, with the most flammable vegetation planted farthest from the house. Native chaparral flora, including oaks, ceanothus and manzanita, are found here. Zone 3 includes plants selected for their low profile and slow-burning characteristics. Wildflowers such as Pacific Coast iris, monkeyflower and California poppies add a splash of color to this zone. Jade, aloe vera, phormium and evergreen currant are among the high-moisture-content plants characteristic of this zone. Cactus, tobira and shiny leaf jasmine are examples of fire-resistant plants that still have a high aesthetic appeal. If one of those lights up near your house, there's no way to save it. One popular plant found almost everywhere in Southern California -- ice plant -- would seem to be an ideal choice for a firescape garden. Dell thinks several successive drought years have finally persuaded Southern Californians to rethink approaches to gardening. Suddenly, xeriscaping -- landscaping with drought-tolerant natives -- is becoming commonplace and fashionable.
