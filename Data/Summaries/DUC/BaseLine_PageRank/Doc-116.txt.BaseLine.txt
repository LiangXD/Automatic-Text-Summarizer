The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with viral pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection, her doctors said. During the next 1{ months, she will require intravenous therapy in the hospital, they said in a statement released by St. John's Hospital and Health Center. Bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than the viral pneumonia Miss Taylor initially contracted. That's because antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses. "She is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctors are pleased with her progress," Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam, said after talking to doctors.
