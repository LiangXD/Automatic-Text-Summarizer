A few years ago Chief Gates referred to gang members as dirty little cowards, and warned them that there is resounding applause to every fall of the hammer. The exchange sounded more like one gang challenging another than a police chief seeking to reduce conflict in the community. Indeed the Rambo-like challenge did not lower violence, and may have increased it. Hundreds of gang homicides occur every year in Los Angeles despite sweeps by the city's police. Mr. Gates would have been better advised to seek community programs for jobs, education, elimination of prejudice and improvement of neighborhoods. Similarly, Mr. Gates vehemently opposed the Police Corps Program backed by other police chiefs. Yet the presence of such non-professionals would discourage the racism and brutality exposed by the Rodney King beating. Many chiefs openly disagreed with Mr. Gates when he opposed the Police Corps Bill in Congress. For example, Mr. Gates once said that blacks were more susceptible than normal people to chokeholds. The unit has been allowed to continue to operate despite its high shooting rate -- or, worse still, because of the shootings. Last year Los Angeles paid $3 million to 52 residents of an apartment complex ransacked by police. Mayor Tom Bradley told the media that such conduct wouldn't be tolerated, and that the wrongdoers would be sought out for punishment. But condemnation of misconduct and excessive force should have been a constant message from the command staff before the brutality, and not an afterthought. Yet, it's hard to imagine commanders preaching restraint in light of the chief's constant belligerent pronouncements. It is hard to imagine someone unlawfully beaten by uniformed officers as others looked on being inspired to respect law and order. Clearly, Daryl Gates's words and actions create doubt about his claim that the Rodney King incident was an aberration.
