U.S. military experts left the Persian Gulf on Thursday after a 3{-week investigation of the destruction of an Iranian airliner by an American warship, Navy officials said. William M. Fogarty arrived July 5, two days after missiles fired by the cruiser USS Vincennes hit an Iran Air Airbus flying over the Strait of Hormuz, killing all 290 people aboard. Fogarty's team worked in secret and made no statements before leaving. The U.S. Navy officials said the report would "work its way up the chain of command" to Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. 8, they said, the report could not be released until mid-August. An initial 15-day deadline for the investigation was extended at Fogarty's request. The Vincennes has been assigned to the Arabian Sea, just outside the Persian Gulf, and is expected to complete its tour at the end of summer.
