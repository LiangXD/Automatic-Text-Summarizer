"There was this huge roar and then I heard a tree crack out there and thought we were all gone," said Marie Prince, a Madison County sheriff's dispatcher. A house-to-house search found no more bodies, but a man and a baby had to be freed from separate homes where they were trapped, Peavy said. You'd never know there was a trailer here," said Dorothy Butler, sister of one of the victims. Rescue units from adjoining counties were helping out, along with state law enforcement and forestry officials. State prisoners were also on their way to help with the cleanup, Peavy said. Trees, roofs and mobile homes were damaged, and at least six other injuries were reported. The twister blew away several homes, blew the roof off a nearby church, overturned cars and knocked down trees, Peavy said. As far as his office knew, all the damage was from one tornado, Peavy said. Three homes and a trailer were destroyed and five homes seriously damaged, he said, and two people were slightly injured. Many county roads were blocked by fallen trees, he said, and officials were surveying the area by helicopter. Tornado watches were still in effect across 14 southeastern Georgia and 15 northeastern Florida counties until at least five hours after the tornado hit. Madison County has been hit by seven tornadoes since 1959 with only one injury reported, according to the National Weather Service.
