Michael Milken, who faces insider trading charges, is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made "junk-bond" financing into the tool of choice for corporate raiders. In so doing, Milken, 42, transformed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from a minor player on Wall Street into a powerhouse and in the process made himself feared, respected and enormously wealthy. The 184-page civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York against Milken, Drexel and others on Wednesday followed months of speculation about Drexel's involvement in the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal. The message was clear: Never mind the burgeoning government investigation of insider trading. It was business as usual at Drexel, and Milken was still king of the junk bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate takeovers. He granted selective media interviews _ on condition there would be no questions about the Securities and Exchange Commission and the investigation. In the years before the insider trading scandal, the financial media wrote glowingly of Milken. At age 10, while other boys were giggling over comic books, Michael Robert Milken was enamored of money. A favorite pastime was hovering over tax returns being prepared by his father, an accountant. Drexel merged with Burnham &amp; Co. in 1973 and Lambert Brussels Witter in 1976 to become today's Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Milken's job was moved to New York. As the story goes, he wearied of the cold Eastern winters that froze his water pipes and kept his two children from playing outside. He also tired of the long commutes from his home in suburban Philadelphia to Wall Street.
