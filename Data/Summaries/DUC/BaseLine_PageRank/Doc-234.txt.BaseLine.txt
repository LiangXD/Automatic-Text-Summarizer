IN California, labour leaders, environmentalists and the 'Perotistas' supporting Mr Ross Perot have signed a Declaration of War against the North American Free Trade Agreement. In Washington state, Nafta opponents wrote alternative menus for a dinner given for Mr Rufus Yerxa, the Deputy US Trade Representative. These featured the potential chemical content of the dishes if the free trade pact becomes a reality and allegedly toxic-laden Mexican produce floods into the US. Equipped as information centres, the vans cruised from town to town showing films and slides of the environmental degradation in Mexico. Nafta's US proponents - mostly the business community - are spending millions, bypassing the voters, to convince Congress to pass Nafta. Forty-one states have been organised, and every two weeks the organisers hold long conference calls to plot strategies. One California gubernatorial hopeful, Ms Kathleen Brown - sister of former Governor Jerry Brown - has been stalked by demonstrators, who even follow her to fundraising events.
