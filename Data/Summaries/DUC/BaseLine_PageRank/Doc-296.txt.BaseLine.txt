Authorities questioned the badly injured pilot of a crashed Boeing 737 Wednesday, but revealed no clues as to why the jet's undamaged right engine was shut down well before the crash while the other engine burned. The Civil Aviation Authority, meanwhile, ordered increased inspections on 37 airplanes with CFM56 engines, the type on the Midland Airways jet that crashed Sunday. Investigators said much more work was needed to pinpoint the cause of the crash, which killed 44 people and injured 82. Freddie Yetman, technical secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said this showed that investigators "must have some suspicion of these circuits." In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered inspections of 300 Boeing 737s for possible cross-wiring of engine warning systems. Mrs. Henshall said some of the "wilder headlines" had been kept from Hunt, but friends and colleagues had told him of the news reports. In the United States, NBC News quoted unidentified U.S. government sources as saying "the plane's flight recorders, which monitor engine performance and the pilots' conversations, indicate the crew shut down the wrong engine. Spokesmen for both the FAA and the National Transportation Board said they knew of no information reaching U.S. officials about the flight recorders' contents. The airplane's two "black boxes," the cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder, are being examined at the government's laboratory in Farnborough, outside London. The timer valve made by GE for the CFM56 engine could not have caused the turbine to fail even if the valve malfunctioned, Kennedy said. But certainly this precautionary measure does not imply there has been any cause identified (for the crash.)"
