"No profit has come from the pathetic postincident attempts to place the blame on the victims," he wrote. "View it as you will, Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down for no good reason. Her actions appeared to be consistently aggressive, and had become a topic of wardroom conversation." "Commander Carlson's comments in the magazine article are his personal opinions of the Airbus incident," he said. Navy spokesman David L. Dillon in San Diego said that the magazine is not part of the Navy. According to Carlson, the event started with the Vincennes' helicopter drawing fire from Iranian speedboats, which he claims were only warning shots. "The Vincennes saw an opportunity for action, and pressed hard for Commander Middle East Force to give permission to fire," Carlson said. "When the decision was made to shoot down the Airbus, the airliner was climbing, not diving; it was showing the proper identification friend or foe... William M. Fogarty, who headed the Navy's investigating team, said the captain of the Vincennes, Will Rogers III, ordered the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken belief the airliner was an Iranian F-14 fighter plane. "Had I done so, the information might have come forward quickly enough to allow me to attempt to dissuade the Vincennes from shooting."
