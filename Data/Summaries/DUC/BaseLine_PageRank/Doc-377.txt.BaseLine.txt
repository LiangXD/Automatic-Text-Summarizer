The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988. "It's very similar to what we had in Armenia," said Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight. Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily. In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
