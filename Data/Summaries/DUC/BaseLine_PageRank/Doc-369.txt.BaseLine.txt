Robert H. Bork, who once hoped for a Supreme Court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court Monday. He was there in the capacity of a lawyer _ apparently making him the first defeated Supreme Court nominee ever to argue before the justices. The Senate rejected Bork's nomination to the high court in 1987 after a bitter political battle. Bork, nominated by then-President Reagan, has said he was the victim of a campaign of lies and distortions led by liberals.
