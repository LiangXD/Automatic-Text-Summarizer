We had to grab whatever we could. ; Scientists warned of more, possibly larger eruptions from the 4,795-foot volcano, which was dormant for six centuries until it began spewing steam in April.; This could only be the beginning, said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.; Tens miles to the east, hundreds of Americans fled Clark Air Base, home to 15,000 American military personnel and their families. Refugees wore cardboard boxes to protect themselves from the ash.; They were stunned by the eruption, reporter Bert Basa said by telephone from Angeles. Their faces turned ashen, and it looked like their hair was standing on end. ; Ash was so thick in the air that at noon, motorists were driving with their headlights on and wipers operating to clear the windshields of volcanic debris. It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes later and a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.; The huge plume 12 1/2 miles high could be seen in Manila, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene said it blocked out the sun. The cloud drifted westward into the South China Sea.; Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could come later.; The crisis has not ended, said Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology. We have signs that the volcano is preparing for another one. ; Punongbayan warned people within a 12-mile radius of Pinatubo to flee.; The smoke is very thick like a dark mushroom in the sky, television reporter Gus Abelgas said in a broadcast from Botolan, near the volcano's western slopes. It's just like what we saw in Hiroshima. ; President Corazon Aquino visited refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for independence day celebrations.; Moments after the first explosion, sirens wailed at Clark Air Base, and 600 of the 1,500 Americans remaining there fled eastward to safety.
