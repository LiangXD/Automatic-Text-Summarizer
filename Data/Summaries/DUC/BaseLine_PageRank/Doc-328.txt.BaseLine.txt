WASHINGTON -- Embattled White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, fighting for his political survival, has a rare bit of good news: While Americans generally don't approve of his actions, most don't think he should resign. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, voters were asked whether charges of inappropriate use of government and corporate transportation by Mr. Sununu are so serious that he should resign. More than 80% of the voters surveyed were aware of the flap, and among them, a clear majority, 58%, said the assertions aren't serious enough for him to resign. Even among Democrats, 49% didn't think he should resign, while 42% thought he should. And while voters aren't clamoring for Mr. Sununu's head, they have formed a more negative impression of him. The survey found that 41% of voters have a negative view of the chief of staff, while just 10% said they have positive feelings. Then, just 20% said they had negative feelings about Mr. Sununu, while 18% reported positive feelings.
