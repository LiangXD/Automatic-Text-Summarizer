A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census is resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed overseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep counting illegal aliens. But the question still may be raised in committee and in the Senate. The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of House members from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses of House seats. Most of these states are in the North, where growth has lagged behind that of the South and West. Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, West and industrial states like New York, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted. "Every census since the Constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens," observed Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really over population shifts that will lead to more House seats for southern and western states. "Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go down to the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose a seat," said Dymally. Census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete illegal aliens, contending they cannot determine who is in the country legally.
