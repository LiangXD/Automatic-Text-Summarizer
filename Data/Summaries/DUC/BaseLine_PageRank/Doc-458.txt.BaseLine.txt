CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with Beijing. It represents a serious escalation in the row which Beijing has linked to London's change in policy towards Hong Kong's democratic development. In London, the Foreign Office rejected Beijing's threat, saying it was contrary to the 1990 Basic Law for Hong Kong. Hong Kong's financial and business community was last night deeply concerned about the growing rift between London and Beijing and is expected to voice louder calls for Mr Patten to retreat. Liberal politicians said China's behaviour underlined the need for democracy to protect Hong Kong from the arbitrary exercise of power by Beijing.
