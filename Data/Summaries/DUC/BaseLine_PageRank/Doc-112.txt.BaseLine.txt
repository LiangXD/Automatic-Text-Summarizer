A seriously ill Elizabeth Taylor battled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by a ventilator, doctors say. Hospital officials described her condition late Monday as stabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the pneumonia. Analysis of the tissue sample was expected to take until Thursday, said her spokeswoman, Chen Sam. The 58-year-old actress, who won best-actress Oscars for "Butterfield 8" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," has been hospitalized more than two weeks. Another spokewoman for the actress, Lisa Del Favaro, said Miss Taylor's family was at her bedside. Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said. Her condition worsened and she was transferred April 16 to St. John's and moved into intensive care on Friday.
