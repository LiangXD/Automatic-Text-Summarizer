Egypt honored its slain parliament speaker and four security men today with a state funeral led by a grim-looking President Hosni Mubarak. Four assassins riding two motorbikes killed el-Mahgoub in a car driving by a luxury hotel by the Nile. Hassan Abu-Basha, a former police minister, told the Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram he believed el-Mahgoub's slaying was the work of Iraqi agents. The funeral was at Nasr City, the same suburban neighborhood where Sadat's funeral took place. They also lined the funeral procession route, as did hundreds of plainclothes security men. Behind them were four military jeeps carrying coffins of the four security men, draped in the red, white and black Egyptian flag. Immediately behind came two officers carrying el-Mahgoub's decorations laid on black-velvet cushions. He said authorities arrested alleged saboteurs who were entering the country with orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to assassinate Egyptian officials. Recent reports said Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council recently moved its headquarters from Libya to Iraq. The assasins wanted to tell their terrorist bosses that they pierced the stability of Egypt," the newspaper said. In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "We are shocked by the assassination of the Egyptian speaker. We don't have any indication at this time who was responsible or what their purposes were," he said.
