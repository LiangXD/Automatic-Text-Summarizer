MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday gave China until the end of the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. After more than six hours of discussions with Lu Ping, director of the Chinese cabinet's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, Mr Patten said: 'I cannot say we reached a meeting of minds on what I put forward.' He also indicated that they achieved little progress in settling the impasse over the financing of Hong Kong's new airport project. It emerged last night that Li Peng, China's prime minister, had refused to see him. On October 7, Mr Patten presented plans for the conduct of the colony's 1994 local and 1995 legislative elections which provide for much greater democracy than has previously been the case in Hong Kong. They should be 'fair', 'open and honest', and 'acceptable to the people of Hong Kong', he said. 'I am bound to say I don't think this answers some of the problems I have to disentangle before the end of this year,' the governor said.
