Several Hispanic leaders said last week that the Clinton administration also had to present a 'blueprint' of a plan to retrain displaced workers before they would give their support. The announcement will deal a blow to supporters of Nafta, who counted on Hispanic backing to get the agreement through Congress. Mr Richard Lopez, an aide to the congressional Hispanic caucus, said last week that differing opinion had prevented the group taking an official position on Nafta. 'The most competitive sectors on both sides of the border would win,' said Prof Raul Hinojosa, of the University of California in Los Angeles and a leader of the Southwest Voter Registration Project. Fifteen Hispanic organisations, including La Raza, propose to set up a trilateral North American Development Bank to direct resources to regions of the US, Mexico and Canada most affected negatively by Nafta.
