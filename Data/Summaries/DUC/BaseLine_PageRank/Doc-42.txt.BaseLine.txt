From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America, more than 40 million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible. In Hawaii, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in six years, stunning scientists by releasing a dazzling fountain of lava at the height of the eclipse.; And in the Bay Area, more than half the sun was covered when the eclipse peaked at 11:20 a.m. It looks like someone took a bite out of an apple, said Matthew Mauranoh, 8, of Mountain View, who peered through a homemade black box at the Foothill Observatory.; The view was diminished for many in Hawaii and Mexico, where low cloud cover obscured the celestial display. At the astronomy observatory at the top of 13,800-foot Mauna Kea, high cirrus clouds thwarted three of the 10 scientific experiments.; It still got dark, but the clouds disappointed about 500 people gathered on the driving range at the Mauna Lani resort in south Kohala. Their hopes had fallen and risen in the previous hour as the clouds came and went.; I came especially for this, and hope we get to see it, said Margaret MacLeod, a mathematics and science teacher from Manhattan Beach shortly before the eclipse in Hawaii.
