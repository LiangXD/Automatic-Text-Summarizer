THE SHARP deterioration in relations between Britain and China over Hong Kong's political future has cast a pall over the colony's financial markets. After half an hour of trading the Hang Seng index was hovering just above 6,000, down more than 245 points, continuing Friday's weaker trend. Analysts had expected a decline in the market, which had recently risen strongly in response to the economic policies announced by China's communist leaders. Agreement to proceed with the HKDollars 163.5bn project was only reached a year ago when Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, visited Beijing. Since then China has found fault with two alternative financing proposals put to it by the Hong Kong government. The government had already let 17 contracts worth HKDollars 19bn - HKDollars 3bn under budget. But Lu's threat, calculated to scare the international financial community, could make it difficult for the government to raise external finance to fund the project. He claimed the governor's plans violated the 1984 Anglo-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and the Basic Law, which will act as Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. He also asserted Mr Patten's plans ignored assurances given by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, to Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, on the conduct of the 1995 polls. They also had to be agreed soon as legislation would have to be placed before LegCo early in the New Year. During the special sitting of LegCo, Mr Patten proposals were endorsed by liberal politicians and some independents. 'Nothing can absolve members of this council from taking a view on the future political development of Hong Kong.' Designed to undermine his public support, these newspapers published more than 70 attacks on him and his plans in the lead up to his visit to Beijing. This condition allows him to change his policies in line with his reading of public opinion and the reality in LegCo.
