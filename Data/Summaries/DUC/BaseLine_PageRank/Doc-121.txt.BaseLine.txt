A 1987 state constitutional amendment broadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felons may own guns, a judge ruled. Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Stephen L. Perkins on Friday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felon against Edward Brown of Cumberland. Prosecutors had argued that the amendment's backers did not intend to allow felons to own guns, but the judge said nothing in the amendment indicated such an intent. Attorney General James E. Tierney said Saturday that the case would be appealed, adding, "With all due respect to Justice Perkins, we think he is wrong."
