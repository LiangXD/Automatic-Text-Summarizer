Many past national security advisers have fancied themselves grand world strategists, yet have failed at the basic task of making the national-security apparatus run smoothly. Gen. Colin Powell, by contrast, is an unpretentious infantryman who gets his kicks by buying old cars and rebuilding them at home in his spare time. As a result, Gen. Powell, named the new national security adviser last week, appears to be the right man for the job at this stage of the Reagan administration. The Reagan foreign policy agenda has been winnowed down largely to the quest for arms-control agreements with the Soviets and the search for change in Nicaragua. Now Mr. Reagan needs someone who is respected inside the system and capable of ironing out remaining internal disputes quietly. Secretary of State George Shultz and Frank Carlucci, the current national security adviser and Mr. Reagan's nominee to become secretary of defense, are both better known in Congress and will be more visible, selling the pending arms-control treaty and other administration policies. When the Reagan administration was planning its invasion of Grenada, for example, Gen. Powell was serving as Mr. Weinberger's chief military assistant at the Pentagon. Pentagon press officers kept the secret, avoided directly lying to suspicious reporters before the operation was launched, yet were ready once news broke. By contrast, John Poindexter, then the deputy national security adviser, froze out White House spokesman Larry Speakes and even prompted him to lie about the operation just before it began.
