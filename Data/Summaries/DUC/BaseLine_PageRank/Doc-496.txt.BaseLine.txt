The 52-year-old son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell was highly regarded by President Reagan, succeeding Frank C. Carlucci as Reagan's national security adviser. Those qualities were cited by The Washington Post in calling Powell the "antidote to Ollie North," the former NSC aide convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal. A senior administration official said in Washington on Wednesday that President Bush is expected to name Powell to the position. In interviews since then, he has emphasized he's proud of the accomplishments of the average U.S. soldier over the years. You'd only know the 1972 Chrysler station wagon parked in the general's space each day was his by reading the four-star decal on its front. In his time off, he tells young blacks to spend their lives helping to open doors for minorities. "Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved the way for you," he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this spring. He tells of his battles with racial discrimination, recalling the time an Alabama state trooper pulled him over for speeding in the early 1960s. Powell's daily interests are more pressing: Keeping his troops ready for combat "with the hope they will never be needed." "The Soviets are going through wrenching historic change, beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system is broken and has to be changed," he said at his FORSCOM installation.
