Flexing its muscles as a cartel, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is raising its diamond prices an average 10% next month. By changing the mix of diamonds that it sells to dealers several months ago, De Beers signaled to the market that it intended to raise quotes, he said. Few listened to us two years ago when we advised clients to buy diamonds at depressed values, Mr. Zucker said. Prices of one-carat D-flawless diamonds have risen to about $14,800 a carat from $12,000 at the beginning of the year, dealers said. In the first seven months of 1987, Japanese imports of polished diamonds surged 60% from the similar period last year to $777 million, he added. Only one out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings less than two decades ago; now more than two-thirds buy. The sharp appreciation of the yen reduced the cost of diamonds for Japanese buyers, Mr. Lamont says. Stronger currencies and lower interest rates in West Germany and other European countries also boosted diamond sales, he says. Sales of $2.56 billion last year were the highest since the 1980 boom when De Beers turnover reached $2.72 billion. In 1979, about 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion were sold, De Beers says.
