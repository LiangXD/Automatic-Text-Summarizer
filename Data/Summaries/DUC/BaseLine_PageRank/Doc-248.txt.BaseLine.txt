Bonds issued by the besieged republic traded briskly and climbed to records. Their bravado is undiminished, reflected in the almost unanimous feeling that there can be no going back now that blood has been spilled in defense of independence. But there is also a growing unease about going forward, because no one knows where Slovenia is headed. For the moment, the Slovenes are feeling lonely, unrecognized by the nations of the world. Their considerable trade with the rest of Yugoslavia, which helped make them the country's richest people, is vanishing. Their identity is being turned upside down; once known as Yugoslavia's developed north, Slovenia will now be lumped together with Western Europe's underdeveloped south. Nationalism overshadows pragmatism, a quality that once distinguished Slovenia from the rest of the often bewildering Balkans. We've decided to be our own country, says Mr. Veselinovic, but we really don't know how we will execute it. The Balkanization of this Balkan country has also become Europe's worst nightmare. The Slovenes, from their days in the Austro-Hungarian empire, have always considered themselves to be Westerners. The per capita annual income of nearly $7,000 is 10 times that of the southern regions of Yugoslavia. But as Slovenes measure themselves with Western Europe, it is they who are the poorer cousins. Okay, we must realize that we will be the less-developed part of Europe, he says. Slovenia's exports of assembled cars, pharmaceuticals, refrigerators and furniture account for a third of the total value of the goods and services it produces. But Slovene economists reckon that exports would have to double to match the performance of other small European countries. It's your ability to engage in international trade that makes you viable. We had been getting a lot of interest from abroad, but they won't invest now while things are so unsettled, he says.
