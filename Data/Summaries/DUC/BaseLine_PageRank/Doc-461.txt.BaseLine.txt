The meaning is quite clear: To go against China through to the end on the Hong Kong issue. Why has Chris Patten no scruples about declaring his stand of going against China through to the end? But he also found excuses to console himself: In an open and free society, such criticisms may appear. He wrote: Our responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong should be put first. This British Hong Kong governor is really more concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people. In fact, responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong advocated by Chris Patten is actually for the colonialist interests of the British Empire. Some people criticized what he had done as jeopardizing more extensive Sino-British relations. People cannot but ask: Why is Hong Kong the biggest and most important part of Sino-British relations? If this humiliation is not wiped out, there can be no harmonious Sino- British relations. Then what did he mean by saying Hong Kong is the biggest and most important part of Sino-British relations? What position does Britain want to have in China and in Asia? Can it not help improve the image of Britain and increase its position in China and Asia? He threatened that if China did not obey the governor's arrangement, it should not expect Britain would agree to its return to GATT.
