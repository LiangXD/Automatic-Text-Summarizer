It is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- mad cow disease -- and few would be prepared to say exactly when and where it will end. Next week European Community health ministers will meet to discuss a German call for a ban on British beef imports to that country. Some German politicians say their country should risk breaking Single Market free trade rules because the potential health risks are so grave. Calling on the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) to do more to explain the disease, the magazine concluded: The alternative is to exacerbate the current climate of fear and uncertainty... MAFF scientists concluded that BSE had appeared in cattle given processed feed that included remains of diseased sheep. New rendering methods, reducing the temperature at which the feed was prepared, were enabling the infective agent to survive, they concluded. Acting on this advice, in July 1988, John MacGregor, then Agriculture Minister, introduced a ban on such ruminant protein being used in feed. Cattle confirmed as having BSE have been put down and incinerated, with the ashes being buried. Some 8,004 cattle have died from BSE despite being born after the feed ban was introduced. MAFF says 5,767 of these were born before the end of 1988, and were probably fed from remaining infected supplies. More recently, researchers have suggested that in some cattle, BSE has been vertically transmitted from cow to calf. There is no evidence that this disturbing disease can be transferred from cow to calf, Farmers Weekly insisted last week. Mr North said: We have more than 8,000 cattle born after the feed ban that have subsequently contracted BSE. The claim that all of these are affected by illegally retained infected feed gets less credible by the hour. Reviled by the farming industry and privately disparaged by MAFF, he nevertheless insists that there may be a threat.
