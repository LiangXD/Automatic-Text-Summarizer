Two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets crashed in the air today and exploded, an air force spokeswoman said. The accident occurred less than two hours after another F-16 crashed into the Black Forest. She said the aircraft, assigned to the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn Air Base, crashed at 1:30 p.m. West German police spokesman Hugo Lenxweiler told the AP in a telephone interview that one of the pilots was killed in the accident. "The other pilot was able to eject safely," Lenxweiler said. Lenxweiler said he did not know if the pilot who ejected suffered any injuries. He said preliminary information indicated that one of the F-16s rammed the other from behind.
