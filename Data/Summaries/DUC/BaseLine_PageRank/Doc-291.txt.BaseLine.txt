Measured by magnitude, Chile is the world's most seismic country, said building engineer Elias Arze, president of the Chilean Seismology and Anti-Seismic Engineering Assn. And like California, Chile is still waiting for another big one, an earthquake of magnitude 8 or more. Both areas are situated along the Pacific ring of fire, the huge faults created by the collision of massive plates of the earth's surface. Chile, along with Alaska, are the sites that have had the biggest seismic occurrences, said Prof. Edgar Kausel, chairman of the Geophysics Department at the University of Chile. The frequency of earth movements prompts Chileans to say that every president has at least one major earthquake during the traditional six-year term in office. Arze said after the 1985 earthquake, teams of foreign experts arrived in Chile to study the effects of the earthquake on buildings. Chilean earthquakes tend to be sharper and last longer than those of California, leading to differences in building design. While California engineers have promoted a flexible design of steel framed buildings that allows them to swing in a quake, Chileans opt for stiffer construction. In an 1835 journal entry about a stop the ship the Beagle made in Chile, scientist Charles Darwin described an earthquake he experienced.
