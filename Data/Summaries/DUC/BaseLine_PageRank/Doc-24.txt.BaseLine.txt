Richard M. Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by black activists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late father, Richard J. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 years before his death in 1976. The younger Daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in his spring campaign, and after defeating black challengers in the primary and general election, he named minorities to 11 of his 21 Cabinet positions. The racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a City Council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks. "There's been no demonstrable change on the part of white leadership in this city to end racism," said Bob Starks, associate professor of inner city studies at Northeastern Illinois University. But Daley maintains that what's getting worse is "irresponsible political rhetoric" from black politicians who are looking ahead to the 1991 mayoral election. Also last week, a human relations task force made up of business and civic leaders released a report saying racism in Chicago was fueled by "a shocking lack of contact" between the city's ethnic groups. Among them was a 55-year-old grandmother, Callie Bryant, who testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police officers who gave her "the sign of the Ku Klux Klan."
