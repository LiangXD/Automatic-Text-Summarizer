And the president, at a White House meeting with reporters, insisted he had made his best and last offer to raise the wage, which has been frozen for eight years. Bush appeared with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who was there to deliver a letter from 35 Republican senators who promised to side with Bush should he veto minimum-wage legislation that fails to meet White House guidelines. Mrs. Dole, appearing today on "CBS This Morning," said, "Many more jobs and job opportunities are saved if you have a six-month training wage." "If we are trying to lift people out of poverty, let's go to other means such as training and education and literacy." "There's enough votes in our grasp here to see that we don't bust the budget and increase the pressures on inflation by going beyond that which the secretary and I have agreed on," Bush said Tuesday. The 35 senators, if their support for Bush held, would leave Democrats short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. "For eight years this same coalition of Republican senators has blocked any increase in the minimum wage," said Sen. But the sponsors, facing mounting pressure from the White House and moderate Democrats, agreed to scale back the final level to $4.55 and add a training wage in an amendment worked out Tuesday that has the support of the House leadership. At the same time, however, they said they would move up the effective date of the initial increase, to $3.85 an hour, to Oct.
