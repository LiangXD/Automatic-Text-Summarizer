Despite what you may be reading, Michael Milken is not a bloodless monster who set out to pillage the world and drown it in a sea of debt. He's a very smart, very driven and very flawed human being whose life -- and whose life's work -- has been completely destroyed. The idea was that the rewards of owning junk bonds more than outweighed the risks of the borrowers going belly up. Which, in fact, they aren't, as the current crash in the junk market -- or in what remains of the junk market -- shows. When the junk market was small and had few players, people had no one to deal with but Milken, and he could keep weak borrowers out of the market. And instead of supervising Milken, top Drexel officials averted their eyes to avoid seeing his sin. In fact, Drexel let Milken move the entire junk department from New York City to his native California. This meant that when early junkmeisters -- Saul P. Steinberg of Reliance Insurance, Laurence A. Tisch of Loews, Carl Lindner of Penn Central and American Financial, to name a few -- wanted to buy or sell junk, they had to deal with Milken. But as the market for junk grew larger -- mainly because of what Michael was doing -- Milken wanted to keep all the business. On the one hand, he lives very modestly and always talks about how important it is not to take on airs. On the other hand, he felt himself smarter than anybody, and thought he could indefinitely get away with sleazy things. Such as telling bond issuers that bond buyers wanted cheap stock as a sweetener, then keeping the stock for himself and a handful of associates. During 1987, 1988 and 1989, I spent many hours with Milken, whom I came to consider a friend. By the time Milken broke down and cried several times Wednesday, it was far too late for him to be considered a human being. Even though he brought it on himself, watching how this man has destroyed himself is enough to make me want to cry.
