A U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II jet tore a swath of destruction through a working-class neighborhood in the central West German city of Remscheid. Rescue workers continued to comb the debris Saturday, as work crews tore down the remains of demolished houses. Wellershoff was referring to recent polls indicating dwindling public support for defense spending and increasing dissatisfaction over disruptive and often deadly military training maneuvers. West Germany, a staunch NATO ally, borders East Germany and Czechoslovakia, thus putting it on the front lines of the East-West struggle. West Germany's skies are crowded with hundreds of jets and helicopters each day. A series of deadly accidents has fueled growing calls for a halt to or drastic reductions in low-level training flights. Even before Thursday's fatal crash, 12 major accidents of military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone. They included 70 people who died as a result of an air show crash at the U.S. base in Ramstein in August.
