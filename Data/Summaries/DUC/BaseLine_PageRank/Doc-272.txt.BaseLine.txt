This lack of turnover has resulted in legislative arrogance, a dearth of new ideas and unaccountability. Congress just violated its legal budget deadline; where are the special prosecutors? Franking privileges, huge staffs, gerrymandering and unfair campaign finance laws have combined to give incumbents a grossly unfair advantage. Democratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor had spirited competition in 1984 when he won with 57%; this year he has no opponent at all. Senators have become just as brazen as their House brethren in shutting out competition. Michael Kinsley writes in the New Republic that if incumbents always win, it's because voters can't be bothered. Incumbents ended the 1988 elections with $63 million left over, while challengers were able to raise and spend a total of only $39 million. Some complain that limiting terms would infringe on democracy by not allowing voters to elect whom they please. We also note that these critics are not agitating in support of Ronald Reagan's call for repeal of the two-term limit for Presidents. That's why the Washington, D.C.-based Americans to Limit Congressional Terms is asking states to call for a constitutional amendment to limit terms. Self-imposed limits on office-holding were once part of this country's public-service ethic, with Members returning to private life after a couple of terms.
