Since Congress stopped raising the federal minimum wage in 1981, the U.S. economy has generated nine million new jobs at all salary levels. Some of those new jobs wouldn't be there if Congress had continued to dictate a minimum level of wages. Worst news of all, Labor Secretary William Brock appears ready to compromise away President Reagan's soundly based opposition to the minimum wage. When politicians and unions promote laws such as Kennedy-Hawkins, they say they are legislating benefits for working people. In reality, a minimum wage prices the weakest members of the work force out of jobs. A few more such compromises and the economic credibility President Reagan has so vigorously established will have been wasted away. Senator Kennedy, of course, wants it known far and wide that he is helping the poor. Only some 5% of American workers today earn the minimum, compared with 12% six years ago. By and large, these are secondary and tertiary earners in households, many of them teen-agers.
