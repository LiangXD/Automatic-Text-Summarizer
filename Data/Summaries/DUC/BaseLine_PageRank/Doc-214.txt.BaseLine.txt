Everyone's going to have to be extra careful. ; In Santa Clara County, the conditions are not yet extreme; March storms probably delayed fire season until mid-June.; But the county's wild lands are littered with heavy fuel -- brush and trees -- killed by the drought or the December freeze.; The late rains have given us a real good grass crop, the catalyst to ignite heavier fuels, said fire prevention officer Dick Mauldin at the forestry department's Morgan Hill ranger unit.; Particularly vulnerable are the eucalyptus groves that did not survive the freeze, Mauldin said. Fires in there are going to be particularly hot, hard to put out, he said.; Statewide, according to the U.S. Forest Service, 10 percent of the trees in the 18 national forests have been killed by the drought or the insect infestations it spawned.; State forestry officials estimate 10 million trees -- Boyd called them standing kindling -- have died in California's wooded areas since the drought began.; California's worst fire year was 1987, when 900,000 acres burned. They think 'it's never going to happen to me,' and when it does they start pointing fingers. ; Mauldin said the Morgan Hill ranger unit will begin manning some of its seasonal stations Monday, begin hiring summer season firefighters June 3, and have all of the back-country stations opened by July 1.; The Morgan Hill unit covers parts of Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Merced counties.; In Alameda and Contra Costa counties, officials also are bracing for a long, hot summer.
