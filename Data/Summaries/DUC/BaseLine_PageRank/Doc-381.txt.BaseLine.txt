Beginning in December, most private employers will be barred by law from using polygraphs and other types of lie detectors to screen job applicants or test the current employees except in rare circumstances. Under new regulations issued Friday by the Labor Department, employers can be fined up to $10,000 for requiring a job seeker or employee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph exam for voice stress analysis. 27, implement legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Reagan last June outlawing about 85 percent of the current use of lie detector tests. The congressional Office of Technology Assessment had estimated that 2 million polygraph examinations were conducted last year _ 90 percent of them by private employers. Some 7.2 million employers nationwide will be required to put up posters in December summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions and outlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detector test.
