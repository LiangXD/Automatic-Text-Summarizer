Solar telescopes yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western North America. "It's kind of neat," said map maker Jan Mayne, who was among dozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar telescopes at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial eclipse, those watching through Caltech's telescopes could see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun. Views were best farther west and north. But because the eclipse was partial most people didn't notice the slight dimming of sunlight. "You can't tell the difference between a partial eclipse and a second-stage smog alert," joked one observer at Caltech. Several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the sun at 9:13 a.m. In San Francisco, the moon eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 9:52 a.m., but the event wasn't visible because of clouds that were so thick they delayed arriving flights at the airport. Fearful that people would suffer eye damage during the eclipse, scientists warned against staring at the sun directly or through inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic film or filters. Total solar eclipses are visible from any single location roughly once every four centuries, though they are visible about every two years from somewhere on Earth, he said.
