No passengers were aboard and no injuries were reported in the 5 a.m. blaze, which was controlled within 90 minutes, said Patrick McKee, a dispatcher for the city fire department. "The fire marshal investigating has determined... that the fire was intentionally set." There were no immediate suspects and no immediate evidence to indicate that the fire was linked to the earlier fire, Christmas said. The 885 passengers left the ship by ferry Monday, a day after they were supposed to return. Thursday, Coast Guard Petty Officer Ken Beatty said the ship passed all inspections and there was no serious damage from the grounding.
