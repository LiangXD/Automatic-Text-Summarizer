But he comes to Washington well prepared for the kind of back-room political arm-twisting that will be required to persuade a divided Congress to pass it. Unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother, 45-year-old Bill Daley is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator with important connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organised labour. However, Mr Daley's appointment to chair the White House's task force on the North America Free Trade Agreement is not a cosy political payoff. Recent polls show that as many as two-thirds of the American people do not support Nafta, and grassroots opposition fuelled by labour groups is growing. With the agreement fated to unravel if it is not ratified by January 1, the battle for congressional support will be fierce, fast, and visible. Clinton needs someone with political sense to move this thing through Congress, and Daley has the connections,' says a fellow Washington lobbyist. Opposition to Nafta comes from core Democratic constituencies, making it a potential political pothole for Mr Clinton. Mr Daley's talents have been summoned, insiders say, to convince moderate Democrats to back the agreement. Clinton ally and fellow Chicago Democrat, Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means committee, is expected to deliver the 20 Democrats on his committee. Mr Perot's populist anti-Nafta campaign touts the 'giant sucking sound' that will be heard as Nafta-loosened jobs flow south of the Texas border. Although it passed into private ownership in 1966, its board is still dominated by high-profile union officials.
