His relatives and friends marked the event with a flood of messages and with a Mass in Washington. Radio reports said Lebanon's three television stations would screen a birthday message from his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome. The daily newspapers An-Nahar and As-Safir and the French-language L'Orient-Le Jour published English texts of letters to Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press who was abducted March 16, 1985. He probably does not know that his father and brother died of cancer. His abductors demand the release of 15 men imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983. Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, an American who was acting dean of agriculture at American University of Beirut. Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the whereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon. Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year, reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for their comrades jailed in Kuwait. He met with prominent Shiites, including leading figures in Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella group for kidnap gangs. It was not clear why Mohtashemi, Rafsanjani's main political rival, came to Lebanon. But the trip underlined his power struggle with Rafsanjani, leader of the comparatively moderate "pragmatists" who want to restore relations with the West. Hezbollah appears to have split into factions, with the main groups supporting either Rafsanjani or Mohtashemi. The former interior minister's surprise appearance in Lebanon quashed reports from Tehran that he was under house arrest.
