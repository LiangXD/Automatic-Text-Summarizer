Sir, Mr James Skinner (Letters, April 11) charges me with misuse of statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries. The statistics I used refer to Latin America, the principal thrust of the argument of the Bishop of Oxford, which focused largely on Brazil. This is like saying that banks, building societies, and governments issuing saving certificates are burdened when they pay interest. I do not know what Mr Skinner has in mind in referring to institutions serving only western interests, and by clear implication inflict suffering on the poor. These factors include, among others, government policies and extensive, often enforced, dependence on precarious subsistence production. State help for the poorest, especially the rural poor, conflicts with the political and personal interests of the rulers, and may not accord with local mores.
