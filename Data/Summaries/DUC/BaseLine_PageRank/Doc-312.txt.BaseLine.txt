Strom Thurmond, the panel's senior Republican, said Thomas' rulings as an appeals court judge were within the mainstream and warned his Democratic colleagues about inappropriate questions.; Requiring a nominee to pass an ideological 'litmus test' would seriously jeopardize the efficacy and independence of the federal judiciary, Thurmond said.; But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that while Thomas has never commented publicly on abortion directly, the nominee once praised a speech that called abortion the constitutional equivalent of murder. ; But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a strong Thomas supporter, said Thomas should not be forced to spell out his views on abortion because Justice David H. Souter, who won Senate confirmation last year, was not required to do so.; Questioned on 'natural law'; Biden said Thomas would be asked about his belief in natural law. Patrick V. Leahy, D-Vt., said, I am impressed -- and the country is -- by the less-traveled road you have taken from Pinpoint, Ga., to the threshold of the Supreme Court. Let them make this determination, Bush said.; 'Independence of the court'; Making a fresh appeal for Thomas on the eve of today's opening hearing, Bush exhorted lawmakers Monday to preserve the independence of the court by avoiding asking the nominee how he would vote.; But one member of the committee, Sen. Liberals contend he pursued policies that slowed, or even blocked, increased opportunities for minorities and women.; Feminist groups have been in the forefront of the liberal coalition opposing Thomas, warning that his vote added to an already conservative Supreme Court could overturn federal protection for abortion rights and send the issue back to state legislatures.
