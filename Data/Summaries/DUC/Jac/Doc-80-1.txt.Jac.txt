U.S. Air Force war planes participating in Operation Desert Shield are flying again after they were ordered grounded for 24 hours following a rash of crashes. The Air Force "has not changed anything" in flight operations as a result of the suspension of flights, Capt. At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said the number of U.S. aircraft accidents in the gulf - including three separate crashes this week - were not out of the ordinary. Williams said the Air Force gave its pilots in the gulf "safety awareness" briefings during the flight ban in order "to review what they need to do to fly more safely." The toll for accidental deaths since Operation Desert Shield began rose to 31 on Wednesday when an Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed on a training mission in Saudi Arabia, killing both crew members. On Monday, two pilots were killed in the crash of an Air Force F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet in Saudi Arabia, and just hours earlier two Marine Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters, each carrying four crew members, crashed over the Arabian Sea, killing all eight men. Williams said the Air Force was the only service that has taken special measures to review safety in the gulf since this week's accidents. Five U.S. aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in the gulf area since the start of Desert Shield two months ago: an F-111, an F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet, an F-15E and two Marine Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters. Also, 20 other aircraft have been involved in non-fatal accidents in the gulf area, Williams said.
