An experimental cancer drug that works after a single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study. The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA _ has produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia patients treated, and none has relapsed so far. Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it "may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia." Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed in recent years. However, interferon is less effective, and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.
