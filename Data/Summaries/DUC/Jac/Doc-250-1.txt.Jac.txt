THE war in the former republics of Yugoslavia is forcing Slovene enterprises to find alternative trading partners among European Community countries as a means of compensating for lost markets in the region. Until 1990, over 30 per cent of Slovenia's exports were with the former Yugoslavia, while about 70 per cent were divided between Comecon, the now defunct socialist trading block, and western European countries. But following an embargo by Serbia on Slovene imports in 1990, and ensuing war in neighbouring Croatia last year, Slovene exports to the former Yugoslavia have fallen to 15 per cent of that previously. The loss of markets in the former Yugoslavia, and the war, has led to a sharp drop in industrial production, which last year fell by 15 per cent, and will fall a further 12 per cent this year. Last year, total exports of goods reached Dollars 3.9bn, and imports, Dollars 4.1bn. Mrs Vojka Ravbar, Slovenia's deputy foreign minister, who earlier this week headed a trade delegation to the UK, said enterprises will have to become even more competitive after privatisation.
