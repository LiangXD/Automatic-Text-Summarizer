The Trans-Antarctica Expedition Mr. Steger writes about in Crossing Antarctica (Knopf, 304 pages, $25) was born of the ambitions of Mr. Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne, who met in 1986 in the middle of separate arctic journeys. Mr. Steger was leading the first confirmed unsupported dog-sled expedition to the North Pole and Dr. Etienne was making the first solo ski there. They met in Mr. Steger's tent, shared tea and their Antarctic dreams and exchanged phone numbers. Steger and Etienne decided to ski and dog-sled across the continent by the longest possible route, a trek that took them from July 27 until March 3. Dahe will do well, Mr. Steger decided, a judgment vindicated over 3,741 miles in windchills sometimes approaching minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Mr. Steger is also a keen judge of dogs, who share equally in the credit for Trans-Antarctica. Because their lives depended on the dogs, the men knew them all intimately, their strengths and foibles. Steger and Somers. Storms slowed them early and confined them to their tents for days on the Antarctic Peninsula and buried some food caches irretrievably under drifts of snow, gravely imperiling the expedition. Amundsen consulted his teammates but his leadership was authoritarian, and the Scott expedition followed Royal Navy traditions of command. Mr. Steger is a leader of a different stripe: experienced, laid back, determined and flexible. As polar literature, Mr. Steger's account, written with Jon Bowermaster, cannot equal the technical fascination of Amundsen's The South Pole.
