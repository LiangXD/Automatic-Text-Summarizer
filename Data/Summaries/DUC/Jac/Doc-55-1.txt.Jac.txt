How much more of an investment should American taxpayers make in the welfare system? This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987. The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients. They point out that part of the money will go for special education, training and work programs for welfare mothers, to induce them off the rolls and into jobs. In short, the Family Welfare Reform Act amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo. Of course, House Democrats could hardly promote this bill as more of the same. So the House's liberal majority hoped to achieve an increase in welfare outlays by making a bow to reform. In fact, while the level of AFDC benefits has decreased in real terms since 1970, the total level of all welfare benefits has not. The House Democrats' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious. It is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the Family Welfare Reform Act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency. By adding several welfare programs to what already exists (without eliminating any), the House bill adds another layer to an already complex welfare system. By further increasing rather than gradually reducing the level of benefits available to recipients, it makes welfare more, not less, enticing.
