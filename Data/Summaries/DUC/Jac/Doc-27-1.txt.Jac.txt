In May, another black clergyman was hit on the head with a shotgun by a white officer while lying on the ground. Police said a youth in the car of the Rev. In another case, three undercover officers were suspended for a shooting this spring that left a young black man crippled. And an officer killed a man who was spraying him with a fire extinguisher. The officer who shot Barnes was a two-year veteran of the force. "The officers were reacting appropriately to a number of circumstances which together led them to that apartment."
