A U.S. Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed today in Saudi Arabia, killing both crew members, U.S. military officials reported. Eight Marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the northern Arabian Sea on Monday. An Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet also went down that day, killing both crew members. In addition to those killed in Saudi Arabia, 13 other Air Force personnel were killed in a crash of a C-5 jet cargo plane in Germany. That aircraft was ferrying supplies and equipment to the Saudi peninsula. The aircraft was an F-model, the latest version of the 23-year-old swing-wing jet that first saw action in Vietnam.
