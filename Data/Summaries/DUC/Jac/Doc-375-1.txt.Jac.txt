Two of the plates sink beneath the islands of Japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the Earth directly below Tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. </P> <P> Most other earthquake-prone regions, including California, only have to worry about two colliding plates. </P> <P> The threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is being reclaimed from Tokyo Bay to serve the needs of millions more who are flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity. But some experts believe Tokyo is already past due for a catastrophic quake, and scientists around the world are watching to see if Japan can win a race against time. </P> <P> The impact of a giant quake here could be felt around the world. Frank Press, president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, has speculated that a great quake here would force Japan to reclaim much of its foreign investment, possibly leading to a collapse of the world economy. </P> <P> Tokyo was leveled once, in 1923, when a monstrous earthquake destroyed a city that had ignored the lessons offered in 1906 from a different city by a distant bay. If we had understood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the damages from the Great Kanto Earthquake which came just 17 years later could have been avoided, says Hirokazu Iemura of Kyoto University's Earthquake Engineering Laboratory. </P> <P> Iemura, who toured the Bay Area after last October's quake, is afraid history may repeat itself. The recent San Francisco temblor, he said, demonstrated what scientists call non-linear consequences of an earthquake. </P> <P> That means that in some cases the earth may tremble far more than the magnitude of the quake would suggest. The Bay Area quake suggested that Tokyo too may be much more vulnerable than experts had thought. </P> <P> For this and other reasons, Tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. </P> <P> A study last year by Japan's National Land Agency concluded that if a great earthquake -- magnitude 8 or greater -- should strike Tokyo in the middle of the night it would kill about 80,000 people. And now, all these years later, Iemura and many other experts in Japan are afraid that history may repeat itself. </P> <P> We are very afraid of fire, said Etsuzo Shima, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and one of Japan's leading earthquake experts. Okada directs a research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. </P> <P> Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations beneath Japan are constantly active. </P> <P> The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the planet. However, they can be quite large, well above magnitude 8, so they pose a great danger to areas on the surface. </P> <P> Furthermore, the strength of an earthquake here is magnified by the geological conditions that underlie nearly the entire city of Tokyo. He has concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. </P> <P> Most experts here had thought that Mexico City was an exceptional case, Iemura said. Is that also a special case? </P> <P> Although he thinks the question needs more study, Iemura is troubled by the fact that much of Tokyo is built on areas similar to San Francisco's Marina District. </P> <P> And like San Francisco, Tokyo is extremely short of land on which to build the high rises needed to house the millions who continue to flock to this crowded city. </P> <P> The answer to the land shortage, Japanese authorities have concluded, is to reclaim more land from Tokyo Bay -- a prospect that deeply troubles many experts. Many of the new structures going up in Tokyo these days are built on filled land, and some people here hope someday to fill in the entire bay, making room for even more people and more buildings. </P> <P> If San Francisco was not an exceptional case, that trend could prove disastrous, many experts believe. </P> <P> Tokyo University's Shima believes there is only one answer, and that is to reverse the flow of people into Tokyo. </P> <P> One group is proposing that the capital be moved out of Tokyo, hoping that the forced move of government workers will result in a lower death toll when the quake hits. Earthquakes occur chiefly in areas where giant slabs of the Earth's crust, called tectonic plates, either grind past each other or crunch together in a process called subduction that forces one plate under another. </P> <P> Japan, however, has to concern itself with four plates. The Pacific and the Philippine Sea plates are being forced under the Eurasia Plate, and the two subducting plates collide directly beneath Tokyo. </P> <P> That dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, as well as about 1,000 smaller quakes every month. </P>
