President Quett Masire of Botswana said Thursday that industrial nations can help relieve drought and hunger in Africa by reducing global warming caused by the greenhouse effect. Masire and Dr. Bernard Ledea Ouedraogo, an anti-hunger organizer in Burkina Faso, were honored as co-winners of the 1988 Africa Prize for Leadership for their efforts in averting hunger. Before the drought, 25 percent of Botswana's children were underweight. In his acceptance speech, Masire thanked Western donor governments and private agencies for their help during the drought, but suggested drought and hunger will get worse in Africa if the Earth's climate keeps warming. "We would prefer to prevent droughts altogether rather than have to learn to deal with them well." The other Africa Prize-winner, Ouedraogo, has organized about 500,000 peasants in nine countries in Africa to develop their villages based on traditional cooperative village leadership.
