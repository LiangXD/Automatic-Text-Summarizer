Reproached, Sununu reversed tracks and followed the Cabinet secretary.; These days, Sununu seems to be making a habit of going the wrong way: The latest flap is over his taking a chauffeur-driven White House car to New York to attend a stamp auction.; And the abrasive chief of staff is discovering that the dozens of people he has insulted or slighted -- from administration officials to members of Congress -- are watching his travails with thinly disguised relish.; Before, Sununu could take comfort in unswerving support from the person who mattered: President Bush. But now, that too is in doubt.; Bush gave Sununu a less-than-ringing endorsement Wednesday, telling reporters that the former New Hampshire governor has created an appearance problem. ; And suddenly, the political community is abuzz with questions about how long Sununu will last in his job and how someone so bright could get himself in so much trouble.; Sununu's latest problems stem from his use of his official car to go to New York for a stamp auction. And some former White House officials say Sununu should recognize that he is not serving Bush well.; In light of his problems with his jet travel and all that, he ought to be a little careful, said Lyn Nofziger, a White House political director under Ronald Reagan. It's the president who has to run for re-election next year, not John Sununu. ; As Sununu himself has noted, some of the criticism goes with the job of saying no to administration officials and lawmakers who want the president's ear.; Somebody has to be the tougher hand, the firmer hand.
