"If there's something in state water law we can hang our hat on to deter this plan, the power is in Las Vegas and Clark County and they'll just go ahead and change the law," said Steve Bradhurst, a consultant to the rural counties. Last year, Clark County casinos accounted for 70 percent of the state's $4.6 billion in gaming revenues. Clark County needs to keep growing for the state's economic health, officials say.
