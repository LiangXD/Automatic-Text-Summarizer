A seriously ill Elizabeth Taylor battled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by a ventilator, doctors say. Hospital officials described her condition late Monday as stabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the pneumonia. The 58-year-old actress, who won best-actress Oscars for "Butterfield 8" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," has been hospitalized more than two weeks. Her condition is presently stabilizing and her physicians are pleased with her progress." Another spokewoman for the actress, Lisa Del Favaro, said Miss Taylor's family was at her bedside. While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator, it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G. Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert who emphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition. During a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, Miss Taylor underwent a tracheotomy, an incision into her windpipe to help her breathe.
