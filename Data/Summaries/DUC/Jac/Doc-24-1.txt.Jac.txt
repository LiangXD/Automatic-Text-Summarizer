Two days of racially charged hearings on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds. The racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a City Council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks. Daley has denounced the alleged police brutality. "I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago," Daley said. At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs. Among them was a 55-year-old grandmother, Callie Bryant, who testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police officers who gave her "the sign of the Ku Klux Klan." The poice department's record was defended by Police Superintendent LeRoy Martin, a black appointee of Washington.
