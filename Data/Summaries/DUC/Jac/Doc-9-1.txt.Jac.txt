New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a brain disorder similar to BSE. Richard Lacey, a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leading critic of government policy on BSE, said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance. He believes that BSE can trigger human brain disease. One argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD. 'Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman's herd) and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health department said. 'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the cases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.' The epidemic continues to defy the ministry of agriculture's predictions that it is about to wane; so far this year there have been 26,695 reported cases, compared with 25,898 to the same date last year. Recent research shows that the prion is an abnormal form of a protein that is normally present in the brain (though its normal function is not yet known). Or - in the case of BSE - it may arrive from another animal. Once in place in the victim's brain, it catalyses what John Collinge, a prion researcher at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, called a slow 'chemical chain reaction', converting the normal protein into its own abnormal form. Most independent experts maintain that no human being - dairy farmer or beef eater - is likely to be exposed to BSE in sufficient quantities to develop brain disease.
