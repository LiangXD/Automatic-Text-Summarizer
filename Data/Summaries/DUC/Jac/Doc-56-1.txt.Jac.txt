President Reagan warned Saturday that he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him that does not contain a work requirement. Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his administration's economic record, saying Friday's unemployment figures showed that the jobless rate "hovered just above the lowest it's been in 14 years." "I will not accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people independent of welfare." "Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform," the president said. "If Congress presents me with a bill that replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of self-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans on welfare, I will use my veto pen." "Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary, but those requirements should be controlled by state and local officials who administer our welfare programs, not federal bureaucrats," Downey said.
