Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knocked off track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids, says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance. Watching Johnson was his chief nemesis: Carl Lewis, the man who was awarded the Olympic gold medals Johnson lost. However, the flamboyant, pony-tailed Lewis told reporters: "I don't understand why Ben Johnson's here." Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented the legislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlled substance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin. He applauded Johnson's courage for attending the news conference. Lewis dismissed reporters' questions that he had used steroids, indicating he would be willing to run against Johnson "if he comes back and he's clean." While Lewis held the spotlight, Johnson slipped away to adjoining congressional offices.
