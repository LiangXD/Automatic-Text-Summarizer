Terry Anderson spent a fifth birthday as a hostage today, a grim milestone in his captivity. Radio reports said Lebanon's three television stations would screen a birthday message from his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome. The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, made up of colleagues from all over the United States, wrote: "Please believe that not a day passes when we do not think of you and pray for you." The Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan said it was sending a 33-foot birthday scroll to Anderson signed by 59 journalists and former colleagues in Tokyo. Police say Lebanese authorities have no information on the whereabouts of Anderson or the 15 other Western hostages in Lebanon. Four days ago, Islamic Jihad made its first statement in a year, reviving an old offer to trade Anderson and Sutherland for their comrades jailed in Kuwait. The statement was seen as a response to a declaration Monday by President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran that he would use its influence to free the hostages if the United States released Iranian assets worth up to $12 billion that have been frozen since 1979. Anderson and Sutherland are among eight American hostages, most believed held by pro-Iranians. Islamic Jihad issued its statement as the leader of Iran's revolutionary radicals, former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, was on a three-week visit to Lebanon. Hezbollah appears to have split into factions, with the main groups supporting either Rafsanjani or Mohtashemi. Rafsanjani dismissed Mohtashemi after his election as president July 28. Since he was kidnapped, Anderson has been allowed to write a few letters to his family and occasionally to see Lebanese newspaper and television reports about relatives. Anderson knows his daughter, Sulome, was born June 7, 1985, but has seen her only in a few seconds of film his captors allowed him to watch on Lebanese TV, according to letters from him released by the kidnappers.
