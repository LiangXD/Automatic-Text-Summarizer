Tuesday when British workers sent a probe 2 inches in diameter through to their French colleagues. Linking England and France, the tunnel symbolizes the growing unification of Europe. Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium overseeing the world's largest engineering project, plans for high-speed trains to pass through the Channel Tunnel in June 1993. In London, the conservative Daily Express newspaper noted today that Britons will be able to walk to France for the first time since the Ice Age. Champagne corks popped and workers danced jigs after French drillers phoned news of the probe's arrival to their British counterparts. Tunnelers are expected to walk through and greet each other with handshakes in a few weeks. The tunneling machine on the French side will then guide itself by laser toward the British machine, ensuring perfect alignment. 26. The linkup came on the maintenance tunnel, the smallest of three tunnels being dug. Since the tunnel construction began in 1987 there have been seven accidental deaths on the British side and two on the French side. Whhen its work is done, the drilling machine on the French side will be hauled out in pieces. The tunnels were joined 13{ miles southeast of Folkestone, England, the British terminus near Dover, and 10 miles northwest of Sangatte, near Calais. The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting for its total length of 31 miles. More than 200 banks are involved in financing the world's costliest tunnel. Officials estimate the tunnel trains may carry 28 million passengers in the first year of operation. Britain warned Napoleon not to try to build the tunnel; digging was started subsequently in 1882 and 1974, but both efforts failed.
