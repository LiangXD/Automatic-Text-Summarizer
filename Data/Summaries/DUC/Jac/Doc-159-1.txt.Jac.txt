Ben Johnson knowingly took steroids and those close close to the runner also were aware of it, fellow Canadian Olympic sprinter Angella Issajenko was quoted as saying in an interview published Sunday. Johnson _ stripped of his Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final after he tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol _ also was taking steroids when he set a world sprint record last summer in Rome, the Toronto Star newspaper quoted Ms. Issajenko as saying. 2. Later, her husband Tony said Ms. Issajenko denied saying she and Johnson took steroids. Ms. Issajenko previously accused a therapist of giving her and Johnson steroids without their knowledge but later retracted the statement. Ms. Issajenko in the interview claimed Dr. George Mario (Jamie) Astaphan provided steroids and monitored the program with the knowledge of Charlie Francis, coach of the Mazda Optimist Track Club, which she and Johnson belong to. Ms. Issajenko, 30, was quoted as saying she had first-hand knowledge Johnson received steroids from Astaphan from 1984 to 1986 but "Ben was going on his own to Jamie after that." After Johnson tested positive for steroids at the Olympics, Ms. Issajenko said therapist Waldemar Matuszewski had "tampered" with her and Johnson. Ms. Issajenko claimed the therapist had put anabolic steroids in the rubbing compound he used to massage their muscles.
