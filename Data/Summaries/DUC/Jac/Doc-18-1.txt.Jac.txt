Don Jackson, said he set up the self-styled "sting" in Long Beach to expose alleged police racism in the Los Angeles area. The police chief in Long Beach declined to comment pending an investigation. The NBC-TV videotape shows a white officer attempting to search Jackson. The officer unleashed a stream of profanity and roughed up Jackson after he demanded to know why he was being searched. But Jackson's boss said the black officer was looking for trouble. "I submit that if Mr. Jackson had stayed in the vehicle, as did the driver, this incident would not have occurred," Hawthorne Police Chief Kenneth R. Stonebraker said at a news conference Monday. The 30-year-old Jackson, who has been on a stress-related disability leave from his Hawthorne job for 22 months, contends the incident is typical of a pattern of racism by white officers in the Los Angeles area. Jackson was riding as a passenger with Jeffrey Hill, a 30-year-old off-duty state corrections officer, when they were pulled over allegedly for straddling lanes, which they denied. Jackson got out after the car stopped and police approached. During an argument, Long Beach Officer Mark Dickey ordered Jackson to face a building and put his hands behind his head. Jackson complied, and moments later was pushed through a plate-glass store window. Police booked Jackson for investigation of interfering with police and challenging a police officer. "The officer simply used violence," Jackson said Monday. "I already cooperated and told him he could search me," Jackson said. Jackson said he chose Long Beach police because of complaints to the Police Misconduct Lawyer's Referral Service of Los Angeles.
