It will have 4,032 rooms, the most of any hotel in the country when it opens in June. The Mirage and Excalibur will be the first new major projects in the city in 15 years, and with their unusual features, they will be must-sees. But Fletch Brunelle, research coordinator for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said that there are hotel construction projects under way all over the city. He estimated that about 11,500 hotel rooms are being built, and 38,000 more are proposed, some of which will be completed after the 20,000 planned to be available by 1992. Many of the new rooms are being added to existing hotels, which are also expanding their casinos and convention halls, Leonard added. The construction boom was created, experts say, by an aggressive marketing strategy used in the past few years by the state, the city's Convention Authority and the major hotels to capture conventions, trade shows and group tours. Las Vegas is the third largest convention city in the United States and probably will be No. 2 within the next two years, Leonard said. Tours from Europe The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority hopes to make the city a top destination for tours from Europe as well. Laughlin, also in Clark County but a little closer than Las Vegas to Los Angeles, had 430 hotel rooms in 1981 but slightly more than 4,000 at the end of 1988, he noted, and it is expected to have about 13,000 at the end of 1991. But Las Vegas is still improving its airport and convention facilities. Although the first of a three-phased, $1-billion expansion of McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas was completed a few years ago, the second phase is under way, and the city has just launched a $35-million expansion of its convention center. New sites are also coming up for future gaming, convention and hotel development. New Experiences Planned But Las Vegas is banking on more than its current gaming and convention capabilities to draw visitors and fill hotel rooms. New games and experiences and a proposed train are in the cards. Said John O'Reilly, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission: I think that in the next 12 to 24 months, there will be some new games with more universal appeal than most games of the past. Las Vegas is also betting on what state tourism director Moreno describes as new experiences, like the live dolphins that will perform at the Mirage and jousting tournaments that will be held at Excalibur. In the meantime, the race is on to see which hotel will have the most rooms to attract the largest conventions. For some time, the 3,174-room Las Vegas Hilton has been billed as the largest hotel in the free world. A glut of hotel rooms will exist, said Leonard, but only temporarily. Occupancy Rates 85% Current occupancy rates are in the 85% range in Las Vegas, while occupancies range between 65% and 70% for hotels in the rest of the country, according to Hennessey. In the eight years I've been here, not that many new motels have been built because most convention and trade show people want hotels with all their amenities. And when you consider that only about 10% of the people in the United States have ever been to Las Vegas, you know that the city has a hell of a long way to grow.
