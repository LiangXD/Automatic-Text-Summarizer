The Air Force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights for two more years, but has made it clear it plans to phase out the missions. And only one satellite is available for tracking hurricanes. "We're not disputing that the hurricane center and the weather service need the data. There are new satellites on the horizon, says Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters also are worried about a shift in the pattern of hurricane activity in recent years. Since 1985, Sheets said, there seem to be more hurricanes and they're more likely to hit the United States. "We'd like to be able to see all the way to Africa," which is where Atlantic hurricanes develop, he said. "I spoke to about 5,000 people on the west coast of Florida," Sheets said. They really have very little concept of what a hurricane is." During the average Atlantic hurricane season, which stretches from June through the end of November, six tropical storms will grow into hurricanes, with heavy rains and winds of 74 mph. Last season, 505 people died in Atlantic hurricanes, including Gilbert and Joan.
