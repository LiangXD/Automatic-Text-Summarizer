The panel, in recommendations Thursday to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits to allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn. The panel suggested a temporary halt to the "let it burn" policy, saying the Forest Service and the National Park Service needed more time to refine their fire management plans. The panel was assembled last September after the worst fire season ever in drought-primed Yellowstone National Park. Some 249 fires seared 706,278 acres within the park boundaries and 40 percent as much again in nearby national forests. The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened. "No... natural fires are to be allowed until fire management plans meet these standards," the report said.
