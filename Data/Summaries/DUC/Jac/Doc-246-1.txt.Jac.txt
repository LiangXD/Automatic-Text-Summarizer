The independent television station Yutel quoted a federal official as saying the government did not approve of the military statement.; Earlier Saturday evening, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic forced yet another delay in the election of Stipe Mesic, a Croat, as president of Yugoslavia.; Mesic election was key; Mesic's election was the political keystone in the peace plan, which also called for the federal troops in Slovenia to return to the barracks and for a three-month delay by the breakaway republics of Slovenia and Croatia in carrying out their independence declarations.; Slovenia refused Saturday night to send a representative to Belgrade for a meeting of the eight-member Yugoslav presidency. The Slovenian defense forces continued efforts to recapture border posts and said they had several under their control.; Casualties mount; At least 40 people were killed in the first two days of fighting in Slovenia, including 20 federal army soldiers, four Slovenian fighters and 12 civilians, said Janez Jansa, the Slovenian defense minister. Driving across the republic, which is about the size of Maryland, was difficult because of checkpoints by territorial guards, barricades of trucks or the wrecks of Slovenian vehicles destroyed by Yugoslav government tanks.; Croatia digs in; The situation also seemed to be deteriorating in Croatia, which announced that it was halting all contributions to the central government and would send no more recruits to the federal army.; In Zagreb, the Croatian capital, federal military aircraft flew low, and federal garrisons stood on full alert. The only other U.S. diplomatic post in Yugoslavia is in Belgrade, the federal capital.; The State Department made the announcement a day after urging Americans in Slovenia and Croatia to leave as soon as they could and suggesting that Americans defer non-essential travel to Yugoslavia until the tensions subside.
