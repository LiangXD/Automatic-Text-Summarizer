The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee says hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Service handled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West, including one-third of Yellowstone National Park. De la Garza said the hearings would focus on forest fire practices, and "can a catastrophe of that nature be avoided or was it a catastrophe?" De la Garza said he hopes the House Interior Committee, which has jurisdiction over the National Park Service, and the Agriculture subcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the U.S. Forest Service, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, the worst in a century. The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300 million fighting the summer fires, the Forest Service said.
