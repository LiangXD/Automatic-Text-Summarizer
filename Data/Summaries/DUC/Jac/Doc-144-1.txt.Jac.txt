MR Lewis Preston, World Bank president, yesterday promised to strengthen the bank's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries. In fiscal 1992, nearly half of all World Bank adjustment loans failed to include specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of calls from Mr Preston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief. At a news conference Mr Preston said the bank was making progress: a decade ago only 5 per cent of bank lending went for human resource development and only 5 per cent of structural adjustment loans had a explicit focus on poverty. While he expected an increase in the share of bank lending aimed at poverty relief, he declined to set precise targets for bank staff. Mr Preston, however, does intend to take several new steps to sharpen the bank's focus on poverty. The bank will publish annual progress reports charting its progress in poverty reduction. Mr Preston said bank efforts to reduce poverty could succeed only if governments concerned co-operated.
