What he had stumbled upon was village banking, a system of investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance their private enterprise, allowing them to create savings while paying interest and qualifying for bigger loans. What Hatch envisioned on that plane five years ago has translated into 400 village banks in nine countries with more than 35,000 members. Hatch, a one-time Peace Corps volunteer with a doctorate in economic development, is founder and president of the non-profit Foundation for International Community Assistance, which recently moved its headquarters from Tucson to Alexandria, Va. There is "almost a 100 percent guarantee" that increased income for women will go into improvements in their children's welfare, Hatch says. Catholic Relief Services entered a five-year, $1 million joint venture a year ago with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the foundation to create 40 village banks in Thailand. The women, when asked, speak of the greatest benefit in terms of what Hatch calls "empowerment perceptions." Their vehicle for improvement is the village bank, each comprised of 30 to 50 women who, through loans starting at $50, can earn enough to provide savings and create capital. Hatch says the loans give them freedom to start their own investment projects in or near home. "Forget the mayor, forget the priest, forget the chief," Hatch says. Each woman signs her name or provides a thumbprint as collateral, agreeing to repay one-sixteenth of the loan weekly, plus interest of 1 percent to 3 percent, in line with local banks. Overall, the average is 97 percent, says Hatch. "Fifty percent or more are illiterate, and I would say 90 percent of them don't have any idea of what they're getting into when we start out," says Hatch. The savings serve as incentive for subsequent loans by increasing the credit line each time, Hatch said. Interest in village banking is mounting. Hatch says he believes village banking has a role to play in reducing poverty along the Mexican border and in slowing down migration to this country. "Ultimately the way out of poverty is savings," Hatch adds.
