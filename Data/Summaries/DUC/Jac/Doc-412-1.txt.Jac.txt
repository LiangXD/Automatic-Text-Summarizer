Someone set a fire early today in a storage room on the luxury liner Regent Star, five days after the ship ran aground in Delaware Bay because of another fire that cut off power, authorities said. The liner was freed Tuesday, and the ship was then docked while the Coast Guard makes safety checks. Thursday, Coast Guard Petty Officer Ken Beatty said the ship passed all inspections and there was no serious damage from the grounding. The ship had been due to start on a two-day cruise later today, but that was canceled after the second fire broke out, authorities said. Many still wearin the orange life preservers they had put om when they abandoned the ship.
