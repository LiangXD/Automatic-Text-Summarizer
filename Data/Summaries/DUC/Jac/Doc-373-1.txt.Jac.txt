IRNA reported Saturday that an earthquake registering 5.5 on the Richter scale shook the region Saturday. Iran is shaken by hundreds of earthquakes a year, ranging from 2.4 to 5.5 on the Richter Scale. The Richter scale is a measure of energy released by an earthquake as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause serious damage and one of 7 can cause widespread heavy damage.
