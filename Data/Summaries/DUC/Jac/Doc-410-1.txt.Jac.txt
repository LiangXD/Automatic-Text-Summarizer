An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise ship off the Mexican coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze and the ship with 715 people aboard was towed to port. "The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the Mexican navy to Cancun," said Diaz. The ship was expected to arrive in Cancun late Wednesday or Thursday. "They used all their CO2 and closed off the engine room," said Diaz. In August 1984, a fire struck the Star's sister ship, the Scandinavian Sun, in the port of Miami, killing a passenger and a crewman. Wednesday's fire occurred as the Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off Isla Mujeres, a Mexican island north of the tourist resort Cancun in the Yucatan peninsula, the Coast Guard said.
