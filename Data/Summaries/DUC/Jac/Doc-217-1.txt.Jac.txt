"Tell me when the airplane's got to leave and I'll have the team on it," coordinator Lynn Findley says into the phone cradled on his shoulder. "We drop slimy red mud on burning trees from antique airplanes," declares the slogan on one T-shirt. In one leg of the L-shaped logistics room, the intelligence division keeps track of fires around the country. The other finds the crews and equipment to attack the flames. "Obviously, firefighting on the line is stressful," said Fire Center spokesman Arnold Hartigan. Hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the Idaho backcountry for days after the last "lightning bust." Flames swept over thousands of acres in several hours' time, creating a smoky miasma around Idaho's capital city. "Fortunately we don't work at this level all year," Hartigan said. We're the supply lines for the troops." In the logistics center, specialists spin Lazy Susans with pink and blue requisition forms as each plea from the fire line is answered. They fill up again and again with thousands of gallons of "slurry," a fertilizer-based substance that stops fires cold. It will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the nation's fires. Until then, the lights will be on at the Fire Center, and the pace will be frenetic. "It's like Wall Street, it's like an operating room," Jarvis says.
