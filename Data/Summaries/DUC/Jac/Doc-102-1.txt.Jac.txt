A lightning-sparked fire in Utah's Zion National Park spread out of control to 1,100 acres Tuesday, but rain helped firefighters hold the line on a 2,000-acre forest fire in Montana and two other major fires in Wyoming. A fire that scorched 1,130 acres in and around the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan was linked to a vehicle exhaust pipe. "Fireworks were touching off fires all over the place. By Monday, $384,000 had been spent to combat the fire, she said. About 40 weekend timber fires were attributed to fireworks. The fire has been burning since at least June 19 in the Custer National Forest. A day after rain beat down the flames of a 1,650-acre fire in the Shoshone National Forest in northwest Wyoming, firefighters were able to reinforce fire lines around the blaze in the absence of strong winds. The lightning-sparked fire has been burning for almost two weeks. Rain Monday night also calmed three fires in Yellowstone National Park in the state's northwest corner. The evacuation in the Bridger-Teton forest was a precaution and the fire started to die down somewhat as temperatures dropped at nighttime, forest spokesman Fred Kingwill said. The fire was declared under control Monday. There were no injuries in the fire, which was reported Tuesday afternoon.
