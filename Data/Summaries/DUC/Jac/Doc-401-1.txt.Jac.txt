Terry Anderson's daughter pleaded for the father she loves but has never known to come home today, the day Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in Lebanon. Former hostages chained themselves to a tree in Paris to protest Anderson's captivity, and President Bush pledged to work for the hostages' release. In a videotape, Anderson's 4-year-old daughter Sulome appeared, wearing a green coat and riding a bicycle given to her at Christmas in Anderson's name. Thank you, said Sulome, who was born 83 days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim faction in Beirut. I love you Daddy, come home, please come home. Lebanese newspapers also published a letter today signed Sulome and Madeleine, from the girl and her mother, Madeleine Bassil, who wait in Cyprus for Anderson's release. A home without a husband or father is not a home, it's hell, the letter said. In Washington, Bush pledged to pursue all legitimate opportunities to win the release of the hostages. Bush did not attend the ceremony, but said in a radio interview that every day I'm President I have a heavy heart when I think of the hostages. Bush has declined to say he is optimistic that any hostages would be released soon.
