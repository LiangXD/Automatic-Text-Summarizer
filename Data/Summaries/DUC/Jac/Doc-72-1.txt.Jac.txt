A U.S. military jet crashed today in a remote, forested area in northern Japan, but the pilot bailed out safely and was taken by helicopter to an American military base, officials said. Wyman E. Vanedoe, was listed in good condition soon after the crash, the U.S. Forces Japan Media Liaison Office in Tokyo said. The U.S. aircraft, belonging to the 14th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Misawa, was on a routine training flight with two other F-16s in partly cloudy skies when it crashed in a forested area in Iwate, police said. Iwate is about 290 miles north of Tokyo.
