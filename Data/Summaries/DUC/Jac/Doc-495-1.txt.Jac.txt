America's senior military officer Tuesday endorsed the East Bloc's move toward a more defensive military posture and reassured his Warsaw Pact counterparts that the United States and its NATO allies will not launch an offensive military operation against Eastern Europe. At a meeting in Vienna, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cited initial evidence that the Warsaw Pact is restructuring its forces in line with new defensive military doctrines in the wake of the Cold War. Powell's remarks appeared to be directed primarily at the chiefs of Eastern Europe's military organizations, whose future roles in the Warsaw Pact are uncertain as a result of the the major domestic upheavals that have swept their nations. U.S. military intelligence officials have complained that while the Soviets say they are reshaping their forces for defensive operations, they continue to deploy large supplies of spare weapons parts and huge ammunition caches near the East-West border, where they could be used by troops in an offensive operation. Contrasting the postwar origin of the Atlantic Alliance with that of the Warsaw Pact, Powell said that in Eastern Europe, the instruments of war were replaced by the instruments of coercion. Saying the seminar's task is to help shape a new order in Europe, Powell defended U.S. military initiatives that have introduced to Europe new, long-range weapons designed to attack Soviet forces sent in to reinforce the first wave of a Warsaw Pact attack on Western Europe.
