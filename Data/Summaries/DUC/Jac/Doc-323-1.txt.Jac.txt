Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association has filed a $6 billion civil lawsuit accusing Michael Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk bonds in the 1980s. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by the failing savings and loan, claims that Milken and others manipulated and coerced Columbia and other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky high-yield bonds. It alleges that the thrift lost more than $2 billion on investments in junk bonds and seeks three times that amount under federal racketeering and antitrust laws. Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, said in the lawsuit that Milken and other Drexel officials manipulated, coerced and deceived the thrift by promising that the market for the bonds would remain active and the thrift would make money. The 176-page lawsuit by Columbia also claims that Milken and other Drexel employees appropriated stock in buyouts for themselves via the investment partnerships that should have gone to junk bond buyers in the deals. The suit accuses Milken and others of manipulating the junk bond market, giving bribes and stock investment opportunities to some thrift executives, misappropriating valuable stock interests in junk bond deals, skimming profits from junk bond trading, and controlling through illegal means a web of thrifts and other investors in junk bonds. Columbia was one of many savings and loans, big investors and other institutions that invested heavily in deals financed or supported by Drexel in the 1980s. Columbia says in the suit that its junk bonds have a total face value of $4.3 billion, but that it has written down their value to $2.5 billion to account for the decline in their market price. The FDIC and Resolution Trust Corp., which administers the failed thrifts, already have filed a claim for $4.5 billion against Drexel in federal bankruptcy court alleging that fraudulent junk bond dealings caused Columbia heavy losses.
