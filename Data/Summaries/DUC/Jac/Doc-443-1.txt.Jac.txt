Crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. Maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s. Cotton deliveries are forecast at less than 90,000 tonnes, down from 205,000 tonnes in 1991, soyabeans at 30,000 tonnes (133,000 tonnes last year), while winter wheat production is expected to fall to less than a third of normal levels. In the low veld, where rains have been below normal since 1989, sugar production has come to a halt, turning Zimbabwe from a substantial exporter into a net importer. Following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, exports of farm produce in US dollar terms will be sharply lower, with tobacco earnings of less than USDollars 500m, compared with Dollars 520m in 1991 (28 per cent of total exports). The collapse of sugar, cotton, and maize exports and reduced foreign earnings from coffee and tea will cost the country at least Dollars 150m (10 per cent of exports) over the next 12 months. At the same time, the country will need to import at least Dollars 350m worth of maize, wheat, sugar and possibly, later in the year, dairy products. The traditional suppliers of maize to these countries - South Africa and Zimbabwe - will be importing up to 7m tonnes themselves this year (5m tonnes for South Africa and 2m tonnes for Zimbabwe). The entire southern African region will need an estimated 10m tonnes of food imports this year. Zimbabwe's needs are put at about 2m tonnes of maize and 500,000 tonnes of wheat, sugar and other products, while Malawi will need at least 1m tonnes and Zambia more than 800,000 tonnes. The country's textile and clothing industry - the main exporter of manufactured goods - has warned of production cutbacks and lay-offs unless it is allowed to import cotton this year. At best, it will take the industry until 1994-95 to regain average production levels of the late 1980s, while the economy as a whole is unlikely to recover fully from the drought of 1992 for at least two years.
