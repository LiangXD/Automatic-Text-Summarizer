At the White House as elsewhere, Vice President George Bush's search for a running mate has people guessing _ and now one of their own is part of the guessing game. Powell is the first black ever to hold the post of national security adviser. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked what he thought of Powell as a vice presidential prospect, said, "Colin Powell is a great American and would be an outstanding candidate for any position. Fitzwater's daily briefings are piped into the offices of top White House aides. Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, responding to a reporter's query, nodded toward Powell and said with a grin, "He's my candidate." Before he went to the Pentagon, Carlucci had Powell's job, and Powell was his deputy. The questions about his future were spurred by a column in Wednesday's Washington post by William Raspberry suggesting that it would be a "brilliant idea" for Bush to pick Powell as his running mate. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., who is himself a potential vice presidential candidate, is among those who have mentioned Powell as a possible Bush running mate. Powell is the only current White House aide being mentioned as even a remote possibility to be Bush's running mate, although former chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. has been reported under consideration. I say it right up front _ I will be vice president. Fitzwater was Bush's press secretary before taking his present job.
