A split, charred tree stump is a clue that lightning was to blame for a forest fire. "You eliminate all those causes, you're down to arson," said Dale Smallwood, a criminal investigator for Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest. Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwood said. On average, Smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires each year in Missouri are deliberately set. Fires in other areas are more likely to be caused by lightning or man's carelessness. As one of the Forest Service's 125 special law enforcement agents, Smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigating fires in the forests he loves. The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set. But the tradition of using fire to manage the woods dies hard. "We had one case (in 1984) where two men went to Sunday school and after school they started a fire with their Sunday school literature," Smallwood said. "Sometimes you hear that someone is angry at the Forest Service because of some administrative action _ because we closed a road or disallowed something. And they don't necessarily have to be mad at the Forest Service. "It just costs a lot of money to put these fires out and it's coming right out of our tax dollars." McDonald, who oversees about 125 Mark Twain employees trained as firefighters, said forest fires cost $25 to $30 an acre to suppress. In the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed, Smallwood said. Last year, a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the Forest Service. "An arson case in the forest is very hard to make," he said. Beyond the cost in dollars of forest fires, there's risk to those who fight them. "We had an employee die of a heart attack fighting an arson fire," Smallwood said, referring to a 1976 blaze.
