Plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands in Biosphere II.Now suddenly they had to devise ways to keep the wild world in.Even the scientists came to cross-purposes in designing this little world.In these areas, where well-defined habitats change, scientists hope to learn how desert encroaches on more productive areas, what happens when fresh water turns brackish, what goes on when climates change.The oxygen is breathed in by humans and animals who breathe out carbon dioxide which is breathed in by the plants and used in photosynthesis which produces more oxygen.Consider hummingbirds, great little pollinators.In all, some 3,800 species of plant and animal life are being invited to the party, and as in the original Eden, snakes.It is the professional nature of engineers and architects to keep the outside world out.It then flows through the plains and grasslands of the savanna, down to the 25-foot deep ocean with its coral reef and then to the salt and freshwater marshes, drying up before it reaches the desert.Probably the first to consider Earth and its environment as a biosphere was a Soviet scientist, V.I. Vernadsky in 1926."We've got acid rain problems, dirty air problems, and we've got carbon dioxide increasing at an alarming rate.
