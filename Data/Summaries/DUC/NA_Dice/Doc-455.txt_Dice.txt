WHEN Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's newly-appointed governor, arrives in the colony in July he will find that, five years away from its reversion to Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong is thriving.Yet Mr Patten's main task is to preside over the peaceful transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997.This change in Hong Kong's economy could not have happened without the historic change of course China embarked upon in 1979.Yet, in spite of the extraordinary economic integration that has taken place over the past decade, China, at a political level, divides Hong Kong society and politics.Last year, Hong Kong exported goods with a value of HKDollars 765.8bn; of these HKDollars 534.8 were 're-exports', more than 80 per cent of which related to trade with China.During that time Hong Kong has reverted to a role it occupied before the Second World War: that of entrepot for China's trade with the outside world.But for the re-export trade, Hong Kong would have a visible trade deficit with the rest of the world because it is becoming more of a service area and transferring some of its manufacturing to south China.Beijing has already begun to agitate on electoral reform; Mr Patten can expect more.To judge by the stock market, property prices, and bilateral trade with and investment in China, Hong Kong appears to have come to terms with its future ruler.The economic integration of Hong Kong with China is, considering that it has occurred just over the past 10 years, nothing short of astonishing.
