The research found that when living conditions are identical, black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria.Another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB bacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone to tuberculosis.When the primary source was black, 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted the bacteria.In homes where the initial source of the disease was white, 17 percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites caught the infection.About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the United States, resulting in 1,700 deaths.In the population at large, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as whites."We found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks," said Dr. William W. Stead.
