"Before the drought we expected a very solid year" for farm lenders, says Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank.President Reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program.Before the drought began damaging crops this month, the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers.The drought is also fanning wildly different predictions of how the farm economy will turn next year.If farmers are strapped for cash this year, the effects would ripple throughout the farm economy.Because of the drought, Iowa realtors expect land prices to rise somewhat less than the 5% to 10% they had been expecting.In April, the price of good-quality Iowa farm land was one-third higher than it was a year earlier.Shrinking soybean stockpiles and soaring prices have stirred speculation that the government may impose an embargo on exports of soybeans and soybean products.One of the biggest problems for farm banks has been that their number of loans, a major source of bank income, has shriveled as farmers paid off their debts with last year's profits.He is hoping that drought damage and rising crop prices will fan inflationary fears so high that land again will be a hot commodity.He said that if the drought continues, industrywide tractor sales could turn flat next year instead of climbing the 5% to 6% that was originally forecast for 1989."It's already getting harder to sell farmers tractors because of the drought," says James K. Ashford, Case president and chief executive officer.Mr. Lyng's order covers counties where livestock-grazing and hay-mowing on so-called set-aside acres already has been authorized, and the drought's effects have been rated as "severe."The department said it won't allow livestock-grazing on land in the soil-conservation program, under which farmers are paid to take erodible acreage out of crop production.The decision by Mr. Lyng, the secretary of agriculture, to allow hay-mowing for 30 days on Conservation Reserve Program land came as farmers and ranchers in North Dakota, Minnesota and other states continued to sell off livestock in response to shortages of hay and other forage crops.Hefty government subsidies on last year's strong harvests put a record amount of cash into farmers pockets.Paul Prentice of Farm Sector Economics Associates, a forecasting concern, thinks the drought could so deplete U.S. stockpiles that the Agriculture Department would drop much of its farm crisis-era planting restrictions.Tractor sales by farm equipment dealers were up 12.8% during the first five months of the year.But Mr. Yeutter said he would "vigorously" oppose any embargo on U.S. soybean exports.The Reagan administration moved to deal with the worsening drought, and a top trade official said that farm export subsidies may have to be curbed.
