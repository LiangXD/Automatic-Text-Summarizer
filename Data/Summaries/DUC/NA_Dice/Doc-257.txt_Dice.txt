In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed good crops at higher prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey.Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected $248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop insurance.Gresham readily offers that he and his son operate their farms under five different names precisely because of federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000 per farmer.To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought payments were matched county by county in a computer database.Despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought.Because much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties, reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific farmers, also available under the FOIA.Government officials say they did the best they could with a rushed program.According to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly $100,000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully.In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an estimated $1.1 billion to the drought, but direct federal aid cut that by 36 percent, to $706 million.By the time checks were being written at the county level, the AP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even "ineffective herbicide."Loopholes were tightened in 1989's smaller $1 billion drought relief program.
