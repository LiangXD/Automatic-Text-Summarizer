"Most of your great athletes are clean," Lewis said."No way in the world does she take drugs," Lewis said, pounding a table."If it has been proven that he took drugs, I would think that (withdrawing the record) is the responsible thing for the sport," Lewis said Sunday.If that were to happen, Lewis would replace Johnson as the world record-holder.Lewis had finished second to Johnson, who set a world record of 9.79 seconds in winning the 100-meter gold medal, and subsequently also had to be tested.Carl Lewis said he knew Ben Johnson was taking performance-enhancing drugs just after their 100-meter final last fall at the Seoul Olympics.According to Francis' testimony, Johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples.Now Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of Johnson's drug test, which returned a positive result for the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol.Lewis said Sunday that officials of the International Amateur Athletics Federation should disallow Johnson's world record from Rome because Francis has testified his sprinter took drugs before the World Championships.It didn't ease the pain of not winning and feeling he (Johnson) was on drugs.That's why they got on drugs."Lewis said track and field is not infested with steroid users as some are beginning to believe in light of the Canadian inquiry.Lewis asked.He set the record at the 1987 World Championships at Rome, where Lewis finished second in 9.93 seconds.Lewis, who won four gold medals at the 1984 Summer Games and has been one of the great sprinters and long jumpers in track and field, said he is determined to help the sport's image.Lewis also contended that Francis' testimony painted a false picture as to why Johnson would take performance-enhancing drugs.IAAF officials, however, said the record will stand because Johnson passed a drug test after the 1987 race.The biggest thing about drug use is denial."I think Ben is 110% irresponsible in not coming out and telling kids to stay off drugs," he said.Lewis, however, refused to implicate any of his colleagues.
