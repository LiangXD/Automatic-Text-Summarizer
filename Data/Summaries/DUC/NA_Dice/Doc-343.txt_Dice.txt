As polar literature, Mr. Steger's account, written with Jon Bowermaster, cannot equal the technical fascination of Amundsen's "The South Pole."Mr. Steger is also a keen judge of dogs, who share equally in the credit for Trans-Antarctica."Dahe will do well," Mr. Steger decided, a judgment vindicated over 3,741 miles in windchills sometimes approaching minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit.The Trans-Antarctica Expedition Mr. Steger writes about in "Crossing Antarctica" (Knopf, 304 pages, $25) was born of the ambitions of Mr. Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne, who met in 1986 in the middle of separate arctic journeys.Steger and Etienne decided to ski and dog-sled across the continent by the longest possible route, a trek that took them from July 27 until March 3.Mr. Steger was leading the first confirmed unsupported dog-sled expedition to the North Pole and Dr. Etienne was making the first solo ski there.Steger and Somers.
