"It's Exxon's policy that in the waters that the ship was located in, the captain should have been on the bridge," Dunphy said."This oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit Alaska since the Good Friday earthquake 25 years ago," Cowper said in a news release.An experiment to assess the possibility of burning off the oil was completed early Sunday and the Coast Guard said Exxon officials were "cautiously optimistic."The spill came at a time when Prince William Sound fishermen were preparing for the herring season, which is followed by harvests of shellfish and salmon.By late Sunday, Exxon officials said a total of 37,500 barrels of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation, leaving more than 900,000 barrels on the ship.More than four miles of floating boom had been placed in an effort to contain the oil, the Coast Guard said Sunday.The tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday.The only larger oil-related accident in U.S. waters was the spilling and burning of up to 10.7 million gallons of oil when two ships collided in Galveston Bay in 1979."It's possible they could avoid the oil," Brown said.Exxon Shipping spokesman Brian Dunphy told The Associated Press that the captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez, Joseph Hazelwood, was not on the bridge at the time of the accident and that third mate Gregory Cousins was in command.Ott said fishing is an economic mainstay in Cordova, more so than in Valdez, which also draws tourists and has the oil terminal.Exxon Shipping Co. held a meeting Sunday between fishermen and a company claims officer.An additional 3,000 feet was to be deployed at Galena Bay at the request of fishermen.However, the wind and waves may make it more difficult to skim oil off the water, said Coast Guard Lt.
