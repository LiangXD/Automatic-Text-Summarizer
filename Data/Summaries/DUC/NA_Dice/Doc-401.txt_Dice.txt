Former hostages chained themselves to a tree in Paris to protest Anderson's captivity, and President Bush pledged to work for the hostages' release.Terry Anderson's daughter pleaded for the father she loves but has never known to come home today, the day Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in Lebanon.Lebanese newspapers also published a letter today signed "Sulome and Madeleine," from the girl and her mother, Madeleine Bassil, who wait in Cyprus for Anderson's release.Thank you," said Sulome, who was born 83 days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim faction in Beirut.Bush did not attend the ceremony, but said in a radio interview that "every day I'm President I have a heavy heart when I think of the hostages."Directing her remarks to the captors of her brother thousands of miles away, she said: "You complain that your story has not been told and yet the man who would tell it has been chained to a basement wall for five years. . . .In a videotape, Anderson's 4-year-old daughter Sulome appeared, wearing a green coat and riding a bicycle given to her at Christmas in Anderson's name.A home without a husband or father is not a home, it's hell," the letter said.In Washington, Bush pledged to pursue "all legitimate opportunities" to win the release of the hostages.
