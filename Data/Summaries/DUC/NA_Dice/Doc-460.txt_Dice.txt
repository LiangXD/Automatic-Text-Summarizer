The people of Hong Kong might blame the Chinese Government for the delay in solving all those problems that need to be tackled urgently.Patten said, "When many places in the world identify with Hong Kong's value system and seek to duplicate its success story, would the world become a better place, a more prosperous place?After Patten came to Hong Kong, the Chinese could no longer keep acting anti-democratic.If, on the other hand, it echoes Patten and begins heaping praises on Hong Kong and emulating the Hong Kong system, can the Chinese Government bring itself to do that?The Chinese wavered on the "through train" idea and the British came up with their own set of arrangements for the 1995 elections.(Section 182) Patten took the initiative to define the relations between China and Hong Kong, giving substance to their contacts as well as clarifying the nature of such relations.China has always looked at Hong Kong unilaterally from top to bottom, demanding that it fall in line with China and not the other way round.Would praising Hong Kong send a wrong message to the local people, misleading them into thinking that China would compromise with Patten and go along with him?It is hard for the Chinese to sing the praises of the Hong Kong system, Hong Kong people, and Hong Kong society.7. In his annual report to the Legislative Council, Patten noted subtly and not so subtly that where Hong Kong was free to make up its mind, things had gone well in the past year, but where consultation with China was necessary, nothing seemed to have worked well.A unilateral emphasis on China's sovereignty would result in integration of a regressive type, meaning that an advanced Hong Kong would have to reach down to accommodate a backward China.One year after arriving in Hong Kong, Patten has certainly commanded much authority with his solid political ideas.What Patten said about Hong Kong's values and its superiority were all satirized by the Chinese media, so much so that one could hardly tell right from wrong anymore.The kind of Sino-Hong Kong relations China wants is one in which Hong Kong complies with all China's orders and satisfies every Chinese demand.3. Patten's second annual report to the Legislative Council is replete with praises for the people of Hong Kong, for their accomplishments, and for the superiority of the Hong Kong system, calling it a miracle of human society.Patten makes endless allusions to what is good about the Hong Kong system and what is bad about the Chinese system, one obvious example being the way the two governments level with the people.If China continues its negative attitude toward Hong Kong, what sort of price will it have to pay?Now that Patten has made politics an integral part of the life of the Hong Kong people and their institutions, can the Chinese continue to counter it with the argument that it is all a matter of trust between nations?Even more striking is the open dialogue and debate that took place in an atmosphere of freedom between Patten and the people of Hong Kong on an equal plane after the governor presented his second annual report (in which the Chinese authorities also played an active part).Hong Kong represents progress and as such should be imitated; China represents power and should therefore be a source of support for Hong Kong to tap into.Subsequently China rejected Hong Kong's political demands by questioning their timetable.How to undo the damage the delay has caused Hong Kong and China (particularly Guangdong)?(Section 174) "The reason is that we still have not been able to convince Chinese officials that Hong Kong citizens' expectations about the development of their political system are in no way excessive but are reasonable and should be met, that they form part of the natural evolution of a society as it matures and becomes more sophisticated.Even as public approval of Patten slipped and opposition rose, anti-Chinese feelings in Hong Kong also gained ground.As for making the Hong Kong system "living, automatic, and autonomous," the relations between China and the special entity of Hong Kong, how the two should be integrated and to what extent, as well as the costs and benefits of such integration... none of that has been considered at length.
