Compare these unemployment rates to those of Alabama and Louisiana, states that have no minimum wage.Moreover, 13 states have minimums below the federal level and nine have no minimum at all.Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05.Moreover, the quoted minimum wage for a state is often deceptive.Yet 41 states are still at or below the current federal level.Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living.California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages.
