The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that BSE was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the agriculture ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months.The Southwood report said it was "most unlikely" that the disease was a threat to humans.The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease."Mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
