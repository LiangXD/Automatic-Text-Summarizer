Amid all the doubts over the Nafta, one thing is certain, trading on markets next week is likely to be hamstrung by uncertainty over Wednesday night's vote, which, like the battle over President Clinton's first budget, will be extremely close.By coincidence, the day after next week's Nafta vote, Clinton will be in Seattle for a trade conference with leaders of Asian Pacific Nations.Nafta is playing on investors' minds because doubts over its passage through Congress have arisen at a vulnerable time for stock and bond prices.Although the President inherited the trade pact from his Republican predecessor, he has invested a lot of his own political capital in getting Nafta through Congress.Stock markets in Mexico and the US, however, believe the chances of success for Nafta improved this week.Investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on Nafta would throw such a spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic growth.
