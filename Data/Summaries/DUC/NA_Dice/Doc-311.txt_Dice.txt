But such personal experiences are irrelevant to the work of a justice of the Supreme Court, according to Thurgood Marshall.Hruska had received letters stating that Mr. Marshall was too liberal for the Supreme Court, that he would upset the "balance" between liberals and conservatives.Kennedy believed that because Mr. Marshall had been moved through the Judiciary Committee before, the Senate could "move expeditiously ahead with his confirmation."Several other issues were brought up during the Marshall hearings that have a bearing on Judge Thomas's case."It is a problem," Mr. Marshall said, though a problem for the committee, not the nominee.Sam Ervin (D., N.C.) attempted to get Mr. Marshall to discuss the case law that preceded Miranda, in much the same way that Sen."We are not seeking a nominee for the Supreme Court who will express the majority view of the Senate on every given issue, or on a given issue of fundamental importance."Ervin, exasperated, pointed out that since the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is so broad that a case on practically any issue might come before it, Mr. Marshall's theory meant that the committee would have a difficult time asking any questions about Mr. Marshall's judicial philosophy.In the end, Mr. Marshall would comment only on such long-decided cases as the Gibbons v.The fact that Mr. Thomas's judicial views are not the same as those of Thurgood Marshall is a reflection of the increasingly pluralistic nature of black society, but hardly an issue worthy of senatorial consideration.During the Marshall hearings in 1967, the issue of the day was not abortion but crime, and the most controversial case was Miranda v.This issue was raised in the Marshall hearings too.Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), whose primary contribution to the Marshall hearings was elucidating the normative guidelines for senators.
