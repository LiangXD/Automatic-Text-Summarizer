Police had arrested Flores on suspicion of assaulting an officer and of resisting arrest but the district attorney's office decided two weeks later to prosecute Flores on the five misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest.But the district attorney's office declined to file any charges because the police report failed to show that Gonzalez was involved in the altercation, Brodie said.Flores was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and obstructing an officer.Prosecution is usually turned down when the arresting officer is suspected of using excessive force, she said.The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits against the city, the department or the police officers involved.Officer Robert Camarillo said in a police report that Cornett was arrested in the 3600 block of Taffrail Road on suspicion of brandishing a weapon, resisting arrest and possessing a loaded firearm.The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Flores but later dismissed all charges during Flores' trial because police failed to turn over a recording of a dispatcher's call requesting that officers investigate the incident at the motorcycle shop, McCracken said.The district attorney's office may have declined to prosecute the suspects because police brutality has been alleged, she said.But Luna said the Police Department later sent him a letter saying the investigation revealed no wrongdoing on the officers' parts.In an incident April 7, Sergio E. Gonzalez, 19, accused Oxnard officers of ordering a police dog to attack him before he was arrested.When he asked the officer why he was being shoved, Ruggiero told him that he was under arrest, according to the complaint.But Flores' lawyer, Sherrie L. McCracken, said the report states that officers were at the shop responding to a complaint of a man with a gun.McCracken said Flores never struggled with the officers until after he was placed in the choke-hold.In a fifth and more recent incident, the district attorney's office declined to file a charge of assaulting an officer against an Oxnard man who says he and several other guests at a June 15 private party were beaten by Oxnard police.14, 1989, the Police Department and officers Jana Younger, Fred Sedillos and James Struck, Guzman-Flores contends that he was grabbed from behind by Younger while in the alley.In another incident, Luis C. Luna, 50, alleges in a complaint filed with the city on June 27, 1989, that he was beaten by three officers near a restaurant in Port Hueneme.The Police Department declined to release Flores' arrest report because, police officials said, it contains his criminal history.The latest incident involving an accusation of police brutality stemmed from the June 15 clash between 18 officers and about 12 party guests at a house in the 1300 block of South E Street.Luna, a public works inspector for the city of Port Hueneme, said he walked up to the police car and asked Officer Peter Ruggiero "in a kidding manner" what he was doing in Port Hueneme.The district attorney's office declined to file charges against Cornett because, Brodie said, there was insufficient evidence to prove that Cornett brandished a gun.The officer poked him with a baton and questioned him about a car parked nearby, Guzman-Flores said in the suit.Officers Steven Vendt and Humberto Jimenez were called to assist Ruggiero, the complaint said.He said, however, that the decisions by the district attorney's office not to prosecute the suspects do not reflect poorly on the department.Police arrested Gonzalez on suspicion of disturbing the peace, Brodie said.
