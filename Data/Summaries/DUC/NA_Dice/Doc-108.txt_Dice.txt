Shrubs and grasses cover what is left of the burnt undergrowth, although fire scars will be visible on some trees for years.Three to five additional bird species are likely to migrate into Yellowstone next year, attracted to the new plants and insects thriving in the meadows.For the first five years after a fire, while surrounding vegetation is still relatively low, there will be a proliferation of wildflowers in the park, she says.Then the forest thins as it ages, trees fall, underbrush grows, and the forest is primed for a fire to start its life cycle over again.Forests visited only by ground fires will rebound almost as quickly.The last fire to rival this year's in intensity roared across much of Yellowstone in the early 1700s.Aspen trees, whose paper-white bark and yellow leaves punctuate the evergreen forests this time of year, also thrive after a fire.Hundreds of plant species proliferate after a fire until "canopy closure" is achieved in about 40 years.In an average year, 2.5 million tourists visit the huge park, and a drop-off because of the fire damage could severely hurt business.As Yellowstone National Park's research biologist, he has already begun to monitor the forest's rebirth from the worst fire on record.Yellowstone's meadows rebound the fastest after a fire.Yellowstone's elk and bison herds, as well as moose, should benefit from the additional forage in the park next year.Next year, the ground cover replacing the park's burnt stands of aging lodgepole pines should provide a 30-fold increase in plant species."Ecologically, there's no down side to the fire," he adds, conceding that similar statements by park officials may have sounded cavalier when the fires were raging.Tourists will be back next year for this . . . and perhaps to see how nature is restoring the forest.Insects begin attacking the snags almost immediately after a fire, and the charred trunks are likely to be toppled by the wind.These and the rest of the park's thermal features remain unscathed by the fires.But many snags, weathering to fence-post gray, will remain as monuments to the fire of 1988 for years to come."Fires have been an integral force in the Yellowstone ecosystem for the past 10,000 years since the glaciers left," Mr. Varley says.The National Park Service has already been at the center of a much-publicized political firestorm over its 16-year-old "natural burn" policy, which allows lightning-caused fires to burn themselves out, except where they threaten towns or park buildings.Only about 500 mature trees were on an acre of hillside here before the fire.True, fire boundaries within the park cover about half the park's acreage.Seeds that have been dormant for decades beneath the soil appear to be triggered by the passing fire, he says, and will germinate next spring.In recent years, environmentalists have for the most part succeeded in promoting the natural processes of the parks.The profusion of pine seeds is just one of the rejuvenating forces at work in Yellowstone even as the fires, largely quenched this week by rain and snow, still smolder.The tiny seeds are slowly released from rock-hard pine cones only after the cones have been seared by the passing flames; indeed, they require a fire to propagate themselves.Mr. Despain has set up or is planning several long-term research projects to study the effects of this year's fires.Fire licked at its corners even as he was mapping the trees within.)Memories of Bambi and Smokey the Bear notwithstanding, Yellowstone's large animals don't appear to have suffered from the fire.The burnt "snags," as charred tree trunks are called, creak in the wind above Mr. Despain and are all that remain of a forest section that sprouted after a fire swept through here about the time of the Civil War.
