Under new regulations issued Friday by the Labor Department, employers can be fined up to $10,000 for requiring a job seeker or employee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph exam for voice stress analysis.Beginning in December, most private employers will be barred by law from using polygraphs and other types of lie detectors to screen job applicants or test the current employees except in rare circumstances.Results of a polygraph test or refusal to submit to such an exam cannot be used alone as a basis for taking any action against an employee.
