He noted that the 1988 report, titled "Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault," presented information that was already widely known among scientists.It just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area," Allen said.The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said.Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale.
