The meaning is quite clear: To go against China through to the end on the Hong Kong issue.People will also ask: Why will the position of Britain in China and Asia be decided by how Britain discharges its responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner?Just as he said in his article, the reason is that what he has done since he became governor of Hong Kong has been criticized and condemned not only by China and people of Hong Kong, but also by people in Britain.In fact, responsibility toward the citizens of Hong Kong advocated by Chris Patten is actually for the colonialist interests of the British Empire.Does Britain really want to return Hong Kong to China only in name while preserving its position as the "governor" to show the power and prestige of the British Empire and go on playing the tyrant in China and Asia as a colonialist?This British Hong Kong governor is really more concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people.The most important point of the article is that Chris Patten was trying hard to explain that all he had done was in the interests of the Hong Kong people.
