The jet, which can hold at least 100 passengers, carried 20 passengers and a crew of two pilots and three flight attendants.Airlines have been slashing their flight schedules and laying off employees because of the downturn.The crash comes at a particularly sensitive time for the travel industry.The jet involved in the crash is almost nine years old.Moments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23 miles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, Mr. Hall said.If preliminary reports that there was wind shear in the area are true, then "that would indicate there was some instability in the atmosphere," he added.
