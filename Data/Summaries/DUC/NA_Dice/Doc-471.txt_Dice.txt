In the type of leukemia suffered by the patients, white blood cells have turned malignant at an immature stage of cell development.Most patients with promyleocytic leukemia apparently have the same defect in two of their 23 chromosomes, the structures in the cell that contain all the genes.The nature of the genetic damage also hinted that doses of retinoic acids might prod the immature malignant cells to proceed to maturity and then die as normal white blood cells do.This new concept of triggering cancer cells to mature and die contrasts with the conventional concept of chemotherapy, in which drugs simply poison malignant cells.
