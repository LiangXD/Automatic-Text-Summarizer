Accion, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit international development group and a leader in the U.S. microloan movement, says it plans to increase its microlending this year to $66.5 million from $37.8 million in 1990 and $9.8 million five years ago.Some Third World banks, notably in Asia, have been making microloans for years.Accion's Ms. Romanow says the group, which serves Latin America, plans to expand the lending to a total of between $500 million and $1 billion over the next five years.Some Third World commercial banks are taking note of poor entrepreneurs' repayment rates.Isaac Btesh, a director and son of the founder, says the bank has lent $80,000 to 100 people so far on 60-day, rotating lines of credit -- with a 100% repayment rate.Everybody does it," says Accion International spokeswoman Gabriela Romanow.Tiny Third World businesses commonly repay these "microloans" faithfully because they crave the security of a favorable credit rating.Though microlending has been around for years, it is now booming.Repayment rates in most nations exceed 90%, she says.
