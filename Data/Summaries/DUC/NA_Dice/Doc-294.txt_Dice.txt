"This is just a normal day," said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center.In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said.Three were in the South Pacific, a 5.9-magnitude shaker near New Caledonia, and quakes of 5.1 and 5.0 in the area of Tonga."There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said Person, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than 25 years.Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said.Over the years, he has heard countless earthquake predictions.A quake of magnitude 2 is about the smallest felt by humans.
