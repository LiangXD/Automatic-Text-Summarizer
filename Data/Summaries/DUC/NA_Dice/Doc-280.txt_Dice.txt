The only respectable argument in favor of term limits that I know of refers to the legislature and involves the interaction with the seniority system.Changes in the seniority system may therefore be a superior alternative to term limits.The voters would be better off if they could reach a binding agreement that precluded the re-election of incumbents, that is, if term limits were instituted.The various complexities about legislative term limits and their interaction with seniority do not arise for executive term limits.To some extent, the current pressures for legislative term limits reflect the reverse desire to shift power away from Congress.Perhaps the best test of executive term limits is to check whether the states with term limits on the governor have performed better or worse than those without such limits.Although the chances of success seem small, one way to proceed would be to call the proposal the Civil Rights Amendment -- recent experience shows that calling something a Civil Rights Act helps to get it passed.But if the electoral control process is working, so that officeholders conform with the interests of the majority of their constituents, then the electorate rewards its representatives with re-election.Of course, since the passage of the 22nd Amendment in 1951, there is a two-term limit on the presidency, and 29 of the 50 states have some kind of term limit on the governor.If a representative's power to favor his or her district did not vary with seniority, then voters would not have an excessive incentive to re-elect incumbents.Legislative term limits are less clear-cut and it is possible to build a respectable case that favors such limits.
