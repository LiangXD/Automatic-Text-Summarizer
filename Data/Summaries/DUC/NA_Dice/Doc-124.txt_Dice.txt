Second, the NRA's insistence on combating any gun control, even that viewed as reasonable by a majority not just of the US population but of gun-owners, has driven away some former political and police supporters.In the process they have lost touch with many of their members, who back gun control in general and specifically the Brady bill.They point to glaring failings in the federal government's policing of the 276,000 licensed gun dealers in the US as evidence of the Brady bill's likely ineffectiveness.Such beliefs have led the NRA to campaign against restrictions on machine guns, assault weapons and armour-piercing bullets.Recent election results have shown, too, that simply being tough on guns is not enough to woo the voters.Despite its uncertain effect, passage of the Brady bill is read by some as a sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control.Most members now favour some form of gun control, but the core membership opposes all restraints on the sale of firearms.Virginia has passed a law restricting people to one gun purchase a month.Many new members and gun owners are women.
