-- In late 1986, when the Senate was considering legislation that would have imposed restraints on Keating's management of Lincoln, Grogan tried to contact Jordan, Cranston's aide on the Banking Committee, for assistance in battling the proposal.James Grogan also told the Senate Ethics Committee he remembers more than one occasion on which Cranston or his aides sought contributions from Keating while at the same time promising to assist Lincoln in its battle against federal regulators.He said she repeated Cranston's contention that he had been "very supportive" of California thrifts and asked him if Keating would raise money for the senator.At the same time, Grogan emphasized that Keating did not always have Cranston's support for his proposals.Grogan and Cranston then discussed Lincoln's problems, with Keating joining the conversation over the office speaker phone.Cranston, whom I believe we gave the most money to, there were several times specifically when I went to his office and asked him, on behalf of Mr. Keating, to take action.Cranston has previously acknowledged that both contributions and assistance for Lincoln were discussed at the dinner.A short time later, according to Grogan, he received a telephone call from Jacobson, the senator's fund-raiser.Grogan contradicted testimony by Jordan concerning a written statement she inserted into the Congressional Record on Cranston's behalf in 1987 that assisted Lincoln in a pending court suit against the bank board.She asked him whether Cranston could get a personal loan for his reelection campaign from Lincoln.He said that Keating, who eventually developed a warm friendship with Cranston, usually waited until the end of his meetings with the senator to discuss contributions.It was the first of nearly $1 million that Cranston solicited from Keating -- $60,000 for his campaigns, $85,000 for the California Democratic Party and $850,000 for voter registration groups founded by the senator.But he appeared to strengthen the committee's case against both Cranston and Sen.As a result, Cranston's campaign subsequently received a $300,000 line of credit from Lincoln that he never used.Grogan also contradicted Riegle's statement that he did not arrange meetings between the five senators and federal regulators in early April, 1987.Cranston would say, 'Could you help in this area, could you help raise money here, could you do that?'He said he later persuaded Keating to assist Cranston by telling him that the senator shared his negative opinion of then-Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray.In April, 1985, as a result of Cranston's appeal for funds, Keating collected $15,000 in checks from his employees for the California senator.Cranston then wrote Grogan's name and telephone number on the card, he said.
