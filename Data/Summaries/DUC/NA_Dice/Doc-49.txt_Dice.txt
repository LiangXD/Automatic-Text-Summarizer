Along a highway near a destroyed apartment complex, cars were flipped and smashed into telephone poles and crushed by trees.A worker at a building owned by the Madison County Jaycees said 42 people were staying there early today, and described the mood of the survivors as "shock, mostly, and disbelief."At least two other tornadoes were reported in Alabama, injuring at least three people in addition to the Huntsville total.Most of the dead were in apartments, stores or cars.The tornado struck Huntsville with virtually no warning Wednesday afternoon as the city's streets grew busy with the approach of rush hour.In Pennsylvania, the weather service said it received unconfirmed reports of a tornado that turned over a car and knocked down trees and power lines near Gettysburg.The tornado was Alabama's deadliest since a 1975 twister killed 22 people in Birmingham, said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in Montgomery.Rescuers crawled through collapsed homes and shops today looking for more victims of a tornado that carved a 3-mile stretch of destruction, killing 17 people, injuring 463 and leaving 1,000 homeless.Thomas Farr was driving on Interstate 85 when the tornado hit.Robert Moder said this morning that 463 people were injured by the twister, which plowed through a school and rural areas as well as a shopping mall and adjacent apartments."It's like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in a blender and putting it on liquefy," said rescue worker Bob Caraway, whose specialty is cave rescues.
