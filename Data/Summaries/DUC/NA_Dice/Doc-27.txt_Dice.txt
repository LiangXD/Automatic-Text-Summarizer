It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year.In June, several white officers bloodied a Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the ground."We are defending the officers being in that apartment," Mills said.Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar and whether he would have lunged at the officer.The officer who shot Barnes was a two-year veteran of the force.Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said.In another case, three undercover officers were suspended for a shooting this spring that left a young black man crippled.
