Although Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell told NBC's "Today Show" on Tuesday morning that the two police officers had been suspended, Police Chief Lawrence L. Binkley said that the officers, Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey, will remain on duty at this stage of the investigation.He said the two police officers become concerned for their safety when Jackson suspiciously exited the car as soon as it stopped, then immediately started arguing when Dickey ordered him to submit to a search for weapons.Full Tape Withheld While edited portions of the tape have been broadcast, Long Beach officials have said they need to see everything filmed by the NBC crew to move ahead with their own investigation of the incident.The Long Beach City Council voted Tuesday to ask the district attorney's office to launch an independent investigation of the Saturday night incident, which was secretly recorded by an NBC television crew.A Long Beach assistant city attorney said his office is considering legal action to obtain the tapes.Police Have No Comment In a statement released a day after the incident, Long Beach police said that Jackson's and Hill's sedan was pulled over for weaving across the center line of the highway.It is not unusual for the district attorney to look into allegations of police brutality, Livesay said, estimating that the office takes on four to six such cases a year.He said the officers were "set up" by black activists intent on creating a scene with police.The FBI has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the man who was arrested -- Don Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police Department -- were violated during his altercation with two Long Beach officers on Pacific Coast Highway, spokesman Fred Reagan said.An investigation by the district attorney will add credibility to the city's own consideration of the brutality allegations, Kell said."I'm sure neither Mr. Jackson nor the officer wanted the window to break, because it was dangerous.""The officer, using proper police tactics, pushed him up (against) the side of a building and unfortunately, the window broke," Hannon said.Kell admitted later Tuesday that he was in error in his "Today Show" comments, but said he would favor firing the officers if it is proved that they used brutal tactics in dealing with Jackson.Curt Livesay said the office was already looking into the case at the request of the Long Beach police chief.The two men said they wanted to demonstrate a long-standing problem of abuse of minority group members by Long Beach police officers.
