Clint Bolick, vice president of the Institute for Justice in Washington and a close friend of Judge Thomas, says that the weekend hearings will deepen his sympathy for victims and "will reconfirm his very strong belief in individual rights."Judge Thomas will have an opportunity to apply his criminal-law views in the case of Jacobson vs. U.S., which is scheduled to be argued next month.Judge Thomas wouldn't be able to vote on the case unless the Supreme Court asks the parties to reargue it once he is on the bench.During the hearing, Judge Thomas made plain his abhorrence of sexual harassment.(Judge Ginsburg withdrew as a nominee to the court in 1987 after it was revealed he had smoked marijuana as a law professor; Justice Fortas resigned in 1969 in a financial scandal.)The issue that dominated the first round of Judge Thomas's hearings last month, was abortion-the most contentious issue before the court.The bitter battle over Judge Thomas's treatment of Anita Hill has pushed a relatively obscure case called Franklin vs. Gwinnett County (Ga.) into the limelight because it involves sexual harassment.Democrats questioned Judge Thomas's credibility when he insisted not only that he didn't have an opinion on Roe vs. Wade, the abortion-rights landmark Supreme Court decision, but also that he had never discussed the 1973 case.Judge Thomas is by no means the first Supreme Court appointee to have weathered scandal.Judge Thomas has for a number of years allied himself with conservative legal thinkers, led by Justice Scalia, who trace many of the government's ills to congressional overreaching.Claudia Withers of the Women's Legal Defense Fund says that such expressions of hostility by Judge Thomas "give us the concern that he wouldn't look favorably on claims" by interest groups that advocate abortion rights before the Supreme Court and that also opposed his nomination.Others are concerned that the Supreme Court as an institution will be diminished for having Judge Thomas on the bench, even though Prof. Hill's allegations of misconduct were not proven.In the end, some critics of Judge Thomas worry that his recent experiences will send him onto the court as an embittered man bent on revenge against his perceived tormentors.In the intervening months, abortion-rights advocates worry that Judge Thomas's bitterness toward them will harden and push him into an anti-Roe majority on the court.But John Danforth, Judge Thomas's most passionate defender in the Senate, says going through the "agonies of hell" has made Clarence Thomas "more sensitive to civil rights, to the necessity of legal protection of the people of this country, than most people who could conceivably be nominated for the Supreme Court."As Judge Thomas helps decide controversial cases over the years, the specter of Anita Hill's lurid allegations will almost certainly be evident.There are no cases involving press freedoms on the court's docket and Judge Thomas has had very limited First Amendment experience, a gap that gave the American Bar Association reservations about the nominee.On the other hand, liberals hope that his experience at the hands of the Senate will have sensitized Judge Thomas to the rights of people charged with wrongdoing.Judge Thomas asserted that Justice Rehnquist, who wrote the majority opinion upholding Congress's action, "failed not only conservatives but all Americans."Once confirmed, a Supreme Court justice "probably can't" be impeached for past infractions, such as lying to Congress or committing sexual harassment, says Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School.
