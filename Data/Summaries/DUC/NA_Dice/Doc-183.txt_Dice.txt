Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the Texas and Louisiana coasts Monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside.One particular concern in Houston was the possibility of major flooding should the city be on the wet, or eastern, side of the hurricane.Chantal is the third named storm since the beginning of the hurricane season June 1.The best estimate Monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the western Louisiana or upper Texas coast.Officials at the National Hurricane Service in Miami said the storm was expected to reach land some time this afternoon or evening.Hurricane warnings were issued from Freeport, Tex., to Morgan City.
