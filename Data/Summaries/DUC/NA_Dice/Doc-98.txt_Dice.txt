The point at issue in Senate debate on a new immigration bill was whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will reallocate House seats among states after the 1990 census.Richard Shelby, D-Ala., proposed, and won, the immigration bill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the redistricting process.Opponents of the Shelby amendment, led by Sen.That was amended after the Civil War to say that the apportionment of House seats will be based on "the whole number of persons in each state."It would give Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher the assignment of adjusting the census figures so that illegal aliens don't count for purposes of redistributing House seats.The Senate has passed an immigration bill including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the redistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear Congress before the next year's national head count.The government made no attempt to count them out in the redistricting process; indeed, the two previous administrations decided that the Constitution required that the census cover illegal aliens along with citizens.Shelby's amendment says only that the secretary is to "make such adjustments in total population figures as may be necessary, using such methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and appropriate" to keep illegal aliens from being counted in congressional reapportionment.
