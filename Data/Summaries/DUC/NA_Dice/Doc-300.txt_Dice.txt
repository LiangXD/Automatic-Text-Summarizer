Ever since, one intelligence official said Wednesday, the French government has realized that its planes were being targeted for some sort of terrorist attack.The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment Wednesday about the possibility of a terrorist attack.In Washington, intelligence specialists said they believe that the jetliner may have been bombed by people seeking to retaliate against France for its recent actions in Lebanon.According to intelligence specialists, security at the airport in Chad at which the plane stopped is under the control of French officials.Late last month, the French government sent a naval task force of five warships into Lebanese waters as part of what President Francois Mitterrand called a "rescue mission" for several thousand French nationals living in the war-torn country."When someone puts a bomb on the plane, it normally takes the resources of a state, at least to set it up," Kupperman said.According to one well-informed intelligence official, both French and American officials took that threat seriously and searched all the luggage on the plane before allowing it to depart.A more likely possibility, speculated terrorist experts and one intelligence source in Washington, was a terrorist attack on behalf of pro-Syrian Muslim forces in Lebanon.A French DC-10 jetliner with 171 people aboard experienced a powerful high-altitude explosion, possibly from a terrorist bomb, before crashing in a remote desert region of Niger in northern Africa, officials in France said Wednesday.The DC-10 operated by the French airline UTA crashed Tuesday after taking off from N'Djamena, Chad, on a flight that originated in Brazzaville, Congo.In Santa Monica, a RAND Corp. analyst, Bruce Hoffman, said Wednesday he believed the attack was probably staged by Shiite Muslim groups concerned that France might intervene in Lebanon on behalf of the Maronite Christians led by Aoun.The London caller linked the attack to the seizure of a Shiite cleric, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon on July 28.While France's willingness to bargain with terrorists for the freedom of hostages had in the past created a modus vivendi that appeared to spare the country from violent attacks, Hoffman and other analysts suggested that the stakes in Lebanon had become too important for those old rules to apply."This would send a pretty clear message to France that they ought to back away," Hoffman added."We can't at this time state for a fact that (the plane) was blown up, but it does have those appearances," he said."In these people's eyes, we're really talking about Lebanon's future.An Air France flight on Aug.That wrenches the entire struggle in Lebanon onto a higher plateau," Hoffman said.French officials said the victims included 31 Frenchpassengers.Three days later, Hezbollah threatened to stage suicide attacks against French targets.
