The right to bear arms protected in the Second Amendment has to do directly with "a well-regulated militia."Didn't just about everyone own a gun in 1791?But what about the private right "to keep and bear arms," to own a gun for self-defense and hunting?This militia amendment was referred to a congressional committee, and came out of committee in this form: "A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms."Well, for example, it means that Congress has the constitutional power to enact a Militia Act of 1992, to require every person who owns a gun or aspires to own one to "enroll" in the militia.In the version of the arms amendment he presented, Madison dropped mention of a standing army and added a conscientious objector clause.Certain explanations were lost or buried in this legislative process: that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the militia; that just about everybody was included in the militia; and that the amendment as a whole sought to minimize if not eliminate reliance on a standing army by emphasizing the role of the state militia, which would require that everyone be ready to be called to serve."The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country, but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person."Two significant changes had been made: first, the phrase "to render military service in person" was replaced by the phrase "to bear arms," again indicating that they are two ways to say the same thing; second, an explanation was added, that the "militia" is "composed of the body of the people."
