Paek Tong-nim, 57, who served as chief investigator of the Defense Security Command and concurrently as a key member of the joint investigating team, told the prosecution that no concrete evidence of Chong's involvement had been detected in the course of probing the assassin Kim, according to a spokesman for the Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office.The joint probe team felt the need to question Chong because when Kim killed Pak he was nearby and Prosecutor Chong Kyong-sik, a member of the joint team, called on the martial law commander at his office three times to question him about his actions on the assassination day, Paek was quoted as saying.Won recently said there was no criminal evidence against Chong when he indicted him, adding the military prosecution then made "a different evaluation" of his actions on the assassination day.
