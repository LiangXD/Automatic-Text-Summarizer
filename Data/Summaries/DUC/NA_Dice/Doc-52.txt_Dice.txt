Ostby said 101 tornadoes touched down from Kansas to Kentucky, leaving nine people dead.The nation had 747 tornadoes in the first six months of 1973 _ one of the biggest years for tornadoes since 1950, when the forecast center began keeping reliable records of the storms.The culprit in this tornado barrage across the Plains is a persistent West Coast pattern of low pressure in the upper atmosphere that is keeping the jet stream anchored at a southern latitude.Flooding in the South and the Plains has been as destructive as the tornadoes.So far this year, 726 tornadoes have touched down nationwide, well ahead of the 640 tornadoes recorded during the first six months of last year, and the 30-year average of 482 tornadoes recorded between January and July, said Frederick Ostby of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center here.
