This time, however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes from anti-abortion protesters with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives.Trying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say."I think it's utter stupidity," Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said.Sobel was "amused" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives.Police actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said.At demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: "L.A. blue, we're with you."In fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force.But, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any nonviolent demonstrator is often "barbaric," and she supports restraints on the police.A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: "By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . .But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and "go limp" when asked to move, others link arms."It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent," said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration.Suddenly, some pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion Republicans are voicing the sort of "police state" rhetoric once associated with anti-war radicals.In introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting nonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado's conservative Republican senator, decried pain-compliance as "something we expect to hear about in Nicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America."* In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: "Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em."Meanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it.In demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and Denver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of "curbside justice."A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting.It's a pain control technique," he said.In fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta."The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground," Nichols said.As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police.Caught off guard by an ambush from their conservative allies, police are howling that the new law -- which could deprive Los Angeles alone of more than $50 million a year in federal aid -- will handcuff them.Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights.""The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous.* In West Hartford, Conn., officers removed their badges and name tags -- purportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled protesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, or with "crotch carries" in which a night stick is stuck between the protester's legs.Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa.Armstrong in lashing out against police pain-compliance tactics and pushing legislation to restrain them.In reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used "in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . . all through the '60s, all through the '70s," Gates said."This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into doing what the federal government wants it to do," said Gates.As Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil disobedience at clinics around the country, the allegations of police brutality increased:The Justice Department already investigates charges of police abuse, Gates pointed out.Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges."Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take action against abortion," he said in a sworn statement last August, given as part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices.At a commission briefing on police brutality charges, organized by Allen in September, Robert McCue, chief of the West Hartford police, defended his officers.Demonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago.
