The evacuation was to take four hours, he said.; There was no indication how long the Americans would stay, but they were ordered to take along important papers and three days worth of food, water and clothing.; Philippines officials earlier had ordered the evacuation of more than 11,000 people from about 20 villages near the volcano, about 60 miles northwest of Manila, after a series of small eruptions began Friday.A fresh flow of lava, gas and debris erupted there Saturday, setting 73 homes on fire.; Nearly 10,000 people have left their homes at the foot of Mount Unzen, and two naval ships stood by to take residents farther away in case a new eruption sent lava, hot rocks and ash over a yet wider area.Scientists said there was no connection, however, to the eruption last Monday of Japan's Mount Unzen, which killed at least 37 people on Kyushu Island.
