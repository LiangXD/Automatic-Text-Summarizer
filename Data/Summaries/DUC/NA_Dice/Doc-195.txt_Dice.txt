One of the country's presidential candidates, Alvaro Gomez, said Friday that Barco should name a three-man council to run Colombia's security forces to avoid a military coup.Both Barco and his party's presidential candidate, Cesar Gaviria, have linked Colombia's salvation to constitutional reform.Former president Alfonso Lopez said the assassinations of three candidates indicated that Colombia's armed forces must be reorganized.But the Medellin cartel denied involvement, and no government official has yet said who was responsible for Pizarro's assassination.Less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia to the brink of political chaos.Barco, of the Liberal Party, rejected Gomez's suggestion of a triumvirate, saying the armed forces would be reorganized only if necessary.After the shooting of candidate Carlos Pizarro in a jetliner Thursday, the country's largest newspaper implored the government to "do something, for the love of God."
