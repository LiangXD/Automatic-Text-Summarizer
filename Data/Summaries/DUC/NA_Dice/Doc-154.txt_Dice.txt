Francis would have us believe that without steroids, Johnson cannot be the fastest.(Johnson disagrees.); At the end of "Speed Trap," Francis says that steroids cannot be simply banned -- their use is too prevalent, they can be disguised too easily and they work too well.No one of Johnson's standing had been caught before.Francis, without naming names, convinces us that steroid usage is rampant, but he tells us what that means to him only in a technical sense."About 42 hours after my life's greatest moment," Francis writes on the first page of his confessional, "Speed Trap," his "nightmare began."; Johnson, the world's fastest man, had tested positive for illegal steroid use.That's one of Francis' theories for why Johnson got caught.; But, Francis says, there is no logical reason for Johnson to have been caught."We ceased being natural ages ago, the moment we stopped running barefoot on dirt paths," Francis writes.
