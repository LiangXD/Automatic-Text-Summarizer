That storm was almost exactly the strength of Hurricane Hugo, which hit in South Carolina with 135 mph winds in September 1989.The scientists took data from Hugo and applied it to the path taken by the 1926 hurricane into Miami.; "It would be a totally different story here," said Max Mayfield, who collected photos from the 1926 storm to illustrate the model."We would expect a major hurricane to hit within 75 miles of Miami every eight years."; At the center, scientists built a computer model to calculate what would happen if the 1926 hurricane were to hit Miami today.Miami has grown immensely since the last major storm and is greatly overdue, they said.; "Historically, south Florida has had more hurricanes than any other site," said Jerry Jarrell, a hurricane specialist eyeing Miami's 27-year hiatus nervously.This, and the number of years since the last major storm hit, has spawned a certain complacency among residents that the specialists find disturbing.; Mayfield went to Miami Beach recently to discuss his model with officials there, and what he heard worried him.; "The fire department did a survey, and 90 percent of the people they talked to said they wouldn't evacuate for a hurricane," Mayfield said.
