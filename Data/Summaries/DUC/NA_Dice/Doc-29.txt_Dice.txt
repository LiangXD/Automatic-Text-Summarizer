I would further recommend that local communities establish citizen review boards.; Police accountability includes the right of the public to review records of investigations of complaints.I represented the suspect.; The offending officer's police report indicated that the suspect's injuries were due to a fall from his bike and that he appeared unconscious, although he had also struggled against being handcuffed.; There is no mention of police brutality.A minimal invasion of their privacy is a small price to pay for the power to maim and kill.; Monitoring police brutality is further complicated by the fact that local communities leave it to the police departments to investigate citizen complaints.Another officer reported that the only verbal abuse was by the suspect toward officers.; The suspect subsequently complained of brutality.Both officers smirked and laughed.; The offending officer was later arrested and prosecuted by the district attorney.; What if there had not been four citizens who observed the brutal beating of my client?; One of the problems in monitoring police brutality is that almost all victims of police abuse have themselves committed some kind of law violation.
