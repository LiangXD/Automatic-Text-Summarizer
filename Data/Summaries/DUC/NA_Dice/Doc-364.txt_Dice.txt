The 60-year-old Judge Bork, a federal appeals court judge, is a recognized expert in antitrust law.He said the vote on Judge Bork will be a "crossroad of conscience" for the Senate.Cranston said on Tuesday that he estimated 49 votes against Judge Bork, 40 in favor and 11 undecided.Mr. Reagan maintained, as the White House has for months, that Judge Bork's philosophy is in the "mainstream of contemporary thought."He added: "They're pretty experienced and tough" and may be able to withstand White House pressure to support Judge Bork.Robert Packwood of Oregon, the only Republican senator to publicly oppose the nomination so far, said he knows of between three and five other Republicans who may oppose Judge Bork.Mr. Kauper said there isn't any reason to assume Judge Bork would overrule antitrust precedents or federal laws and that Judge Bork advocates an antitrust approach "designed to promote consumer welfare."Legal experts differed sharply in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over what impact Judge Robert Bork's free-market approach to antitrust law would have on competition and consumers.But Donald Baker, a Washington lawyer and former chief of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said in a statement that Judge Bork is in the "mainstream of antitrust," which "means his antitrust thinking . . . . is widely used by antitrust practitioners, antitrust courts and even antitrust professors."White House officials think the view of Judge Bork as a champion of crime fighters is politically appealing but believe it hasn't gotten enough attention during the Senate's confirmation hearings.
