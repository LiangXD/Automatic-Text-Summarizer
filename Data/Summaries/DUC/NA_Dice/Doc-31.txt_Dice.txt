Mayor Bradley said he hopes that Chief Gates's will "follow the commission's recommendations" to "commence the transition to a new chief of police."Nearly one-quarter of 650 officers responding to a commission survey agreed that "racial bias on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and community," and in some cases "may lead to the use of excessive force," the report said.But the commission called for a shift away from the force's paramilitaristic, us-against-them style, and said the department must embrace the "community-based" policing style that encourages officers to spend less time in their cars and more time interacting with citizens in the communities they serve.But the most surprising part of the report was its recommendation that Chief Gates resign, after a transitional period in which he would begin implementing the commission's proposals."This report will be a must-read for police chiefs around the country," said Hubert Williams, executive director of the Police Foundation, a Washington, D.C., law enforcement research group.Among the commission's recommendations are: -- A commission appointed by the mayor that oversees the department should be reorganized and strengthened, and made responsible for handling citizen complaints.Even before the commission's report was issued, community groups that monitor the LAPD noted a decline in brutality complaints.Mr. Williams likened the report to the Knapp Commission, a 1970s blue-ribbon study that exposed widespread corruption in the New York Police Department and led to significant improvements there.
