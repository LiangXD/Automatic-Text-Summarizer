People involved in Milken's plans for the new firm, International Capital Assets Group, said Milken does not intend to raid Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond division, which he founded and ran until his March indictment."I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as part of the firm's settlement with the government, but I look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies," Michael Milken said in a statement.Under Drexel's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider trading and other fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Drexel and its employees are barred from doing business with Milken, directly or indirectly.A Drexel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Wall Street giant does not anticipate conflicts with Milken's new firm because it will not be in the brokerage business.They also are expected to challenge the provision barring Drexel and Milken from doing business with the same clients.The Drexel official said the provision likely will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, so some contact between the New York investment firm's clients and Milken may occur.
