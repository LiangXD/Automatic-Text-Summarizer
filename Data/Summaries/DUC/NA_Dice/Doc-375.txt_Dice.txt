He has concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. </P> <P> Most experts here had thought that Mexico City was an "exceptional case," Iemura said.The Bay Area quake suggested that Tokyo too may be much more vulnerable than experts had thought. </P> <P> For this and other reasons, Tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. </P> <P> A study last year by Japan's National Land Agency concluded that if a great earthquake -- magnitude 8 or greater -- should strike Tokyo in the middle of the night it would kill about 80,000 people.Earthquakes occur chiefly in areas where giant slabs of the Earth's crust, called tectonic plates, either grind past each other or crunch together in a process called "subduction" that forces one plate under another. </P> <P> Japan, however, has to concern itself with four plates.And now, all these years later, Iemura and many other experts in Japan are afraid that history may repeat itself. </P> <P> "We are very afraid of fire," said Etsuzo Shima, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and one of Japan's leading earthquake experts.The recent San Francisco temblor, he said, demonstrated what scientists call "non-linear" consequences of an earthquake. </P> <P> That means that in some cases the earth may tremble far more than the magnitude of the quake would suggest.Okada directs a research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. </P> <P> Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations beneath Japan are constantly active. </P> <P> The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the planet.However, they can be quite large, well above magnitude 8, so they pose a great danger to areas on the surface. </P> <P> Furthermore, the strength of an earthquake here is magnified by the geological conditions that underlie nearly the entire city of Tokyo."If we had understood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the damages from the Great Kanto Earthquake which came just 17 years later could have been avoided," says Hirokazu Iemura of Kyoto University's Earthquake Engineering Laboratory. </P> <P> Iemura, who toured the Bay Area after last October's quake, is afraid history may repeat itself.
