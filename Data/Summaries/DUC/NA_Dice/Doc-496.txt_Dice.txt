Born in New York, Powell completed training in the Airborne and Ranger schools and served in Germany and Vietnam.Carlucci says that Powell has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that Reagan got Powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the general had turned Carlucci down several times.Washington colleagues have described Powell as a "soldier's soldier" who doesn't like staff jobs.Powell took over U.S. Forces Command, or FORSCOM, in April, putting him in charge of troop readiness and deployment for the U.S. Army.The four-star Army general, who became national security adviser in 1987 and heads the U.S. Forces Command at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, would become the first black to serve as the nation's senior military officer.On personal level, however, Powell doesn't always keep up with the times.
