De Beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market through 'sights' offered by the CSO ten times a year to about 160 selected buyers.But De Beers makes huge profits from its diamond business - a record Dollars 1.24bn in 1990 and more than Dollars 1bn last year.'By mopping up Angolan supplies we can say that more of the world's rough diamonds are passing through the CSO than ever before,' he says.'What the CSO for many years has done successfully, is to operate a buffer pool, stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand is in excess of the level of supply.The CSO's diamond stocks, worth under Dollars 1bn in 1980 rose to Dollars 1.9bn by 1984.But in the meantime Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers' chairman, insists that the CSO's control of the diamond market is not slipping.But the cartel has ensured that rough (uncut) diamond prices have risen steadily since the 1930s - even when in the depths of the 1981-86 recession the price of a top-quality, one carat gem diamond slumped in the retail market from Dollars 60,000 to Dollars 10,000.The cartel is organised by De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds.The future of De Beers' diamond operations in Namibia were discussed with the government there yesterday.Hundreds of diamond investment trusts and traders were bankrupted at that time and Australia and Zaire challenged De Beers' near-monopoly.It must be open to question whether another Japan can be found to lift the diamond market as the present recession ends.
