CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with Beijing.The challenge was immediately rejected by the Hong Kong government, which accused China of violating Anglo-Chinese agreements and its own law for Hong Kong which comes into force after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in June 1997.The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese government, in a dispatch released through the Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, said that all contracts, leases and agreements signed and ratified by the Hong Kong government would be invalid after June 30 1997 unless they were first approved by China.
