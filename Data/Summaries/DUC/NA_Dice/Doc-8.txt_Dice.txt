Last week, MAFF said that the numbers of confirmed BSE cases in the first two months of this year showed a 20 per cent drop over the same period in 1993 -- proof, the ministry says, that the epidemic is waning.Some 8,004 cattle have died from BSE despite being born after the feed ban was introduced.The ministry believes that the reason more cattle have died is that farmers or food renderers kept using infected feed after the ban.This month 19 cattle have died on farms where MAFF is conducting a seven-year experiment into the disease.Mr North said: "We have more than 8,000 cattle born after the feed ban that have subsequently contracted BSE.MAFF scientists concluded that BSE had appeared in cattle given processed feed that included remains of diseased sheep.That year it was officially predicted that 20,000 animals would be affected before the feed ban, together with the drying up of any supplies already on farms, had its effect.More recently, researchers have suggested that in some cattle, BSE has been "vertically" transmitted from cow to calf.That prospect, discounted by most scientists -- including MAFF critics such as Mr Purdey -- is considered a possibility by Richard Lacey, a Leeds University microbiologist who has been studying cases of CJD, a disease with a long incubation period.
