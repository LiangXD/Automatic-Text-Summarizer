In Paris, former hostages Jean-Paul Kauffman and Roger Auque put on blindfolds and chained themselves to a tree outside the Iranian Embassy to protest Anderson's captivity.The solemn ceremony, held across the street from the White House, also brought together the families of the seven other Americans who were kidnaped after Anderson and are still held in Lebanon.Kauffman and Auque were silent during their protest but said in a statement: "We have taken this action so people know how Terry Anderson is living at this moment.Opponents of the Iranian regime said they see no reason to believe that a hostage release is imminent.In a letter published by seven Beirut newspapers, Anderson's wife, Madeline Bassil, told her husband that she and their daughter also feel like hostages.Bush told reporters: "I'm going to do everything I can to get those hostages out of there, sometimes privately, sometimes publicly."She also said she had "faith" that all the hostages would be released "in the coming weeks."Family, friends and colleagues of Associated Press correspondent Terry A. Anderson gathered at Lafayette Park on Friday to mark an anniversary they had hoped to never see.The Lafayette Park ceremony was sponsored by "No Greater Love," a Washington-based support group for the families of the hostages.Asked by reporters Friday whether he had any optimistic news for the families of the hostages, Bush demurred.The Iranian news media have begun referring to the hostages again as American "spies."Bush declined to appear at Friday's ceremony across from the White House, but he and his wife, Barbara, met for half an hour with Anderson's sister, Peggy Say.The two were among 10 French hostages released by their captors in Lebanon between 1986 and 1988.Meanwhile, in Damascus, former President Jimmy Carter met Friday with Syrian President Hafez Assad and also expressed optimism about the fate of the hostages.The families of the hostages have received little news of their condition other than an occasional -- and often distressing -- photo.
