Officials such as Mr David Mulford of the US Treasury say the recent forgiveness of about half of Poland's official debt will not set a precedent for other debtors.Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector.This is both because countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the bank's policies were sometimes misguided.As incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank's strategies for promoting development.Many optimists see the debt reduction strategy launched by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, in 1989, as a 'final solution' to the debt crisis.He says the bank's main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a 'balanced relationship between government and the market' in developing countries.Development economists, meanwhile, are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World Development Report and focus more on poverty alleviation.Many Third World countries have gone backwards.What kind of bank will Mr Preston inherit from his predecessor, Mr Barber Conable?'Liberalisation matters,' says Mr Williamson at the Institute for International Economics, 'but education is more important.'The maturing of bank programmes and the failure to expand lending much in the 1980s has led to a marked shrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries.'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,' concludes Mr Richard Feinberg, director of the Overseas Development Council in Washington.'The Brady plan is enough,' says Mr Williamson, if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt.Should a significant chunk of the bank's loans be made direct to the private sector?Such values are alien in many developing countries, but that does not imply they should be denied the means for economic development.Under the plan official agencies assume some of the burden of developing countries' private debts on condition that they implement market-oriented economic reforms.
