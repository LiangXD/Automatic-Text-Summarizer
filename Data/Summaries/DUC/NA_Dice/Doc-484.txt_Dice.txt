"Mine has always been that it's unlikely, because I think people tend to act as crews when they get in an experience that is prolonged," Connors said.Bechtel said the public has a misconception that putting eight people together will mean "all kinds of interesting things can happen."The Biosphere's purpose is "not to test interpersonal relations," but to test "whether they can reproduce the Earth's atmosphere by a mixture of plants, animals and bacteria," Bechtel said.Walford and Biosphere spokeswoman Kathleen Dyhr, also hoping to make the crew, said each candidate has worked on the project for at least three years.It's unlikely, all agree, that any of the eight crew members to be selected later this year from among 14 candidates in this $30 million private experiment, will go bonkers.How, indeed, are eight "biospherians" going to fare testing the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting environments, called biomes, as well as an intensive agricultural complex, to duplicate the Earth's ecology?Bechtel said: "How could you avoid it?Most say the crew will develop its own "equilibrium" once closed life gets under way."Given the fact that various members of the clergy have shown themselves to be innovative and agreeable to doing marriages under very unusual circumstances, I'm sure that they could find a way to do it," Ms. Dyhr said.
