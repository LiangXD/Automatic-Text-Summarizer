A3 HOW POISONS IN SMOKE AFFECT FIREFIGHTERS Wild-land firefighters are exposed to a variety of poisonous substances in the smoke they breathe.Combined, the researchers tested the lungs of more than 100 California wildland firefighters before and after the 1988 and 1989 fire seasons.The smallest particles, which are the most dangerous to lungs, are found in smoldering fires, where firefighters spend most of their time.Firefighters themselves -- who traditionally have brandished the attitude that if you can't stand the heat, you get out of the fire -- are now demanding protection.The California health department's tests on 63 firefighters showed they lost as much as 10% of their lung capacity during one six-month fire season, with an average loss of 4%.For many firefighters, the lung congestion turns into bronchitis or walking pneumonia three times a year, said Linane, 46, who has fought wildfires for 28 years."I don't want to wait for firefighters to die," said Jack Wiest, the department's chief of fire planning and research.For nearly 10 years, urban firefighters have known that toxic smoke from burning structures and cars greatly increases their chances of cancer and heart disease.National and state fire officials remain wary of the purifiers because they don't provide full protection from smoke."For some of the firefighters, the drop in lung function was rather striking."Immediately after the 1987 fires, Ford and other researchers from Johns Hopkins and the California health department mounted studies.Ford questioned the firefighters about their health and was shocked by how many had alarming symptoms.But the U.S. Forest Service and state and county fire officials have been unable to protect their wildfire crews because they know of no gear light enough for firefighters to wear while hiking miles in burning terrain or effective enough to filter out the wide variety of toxic materials in smoke."Respiratory protection for wildland firefighters is non-existent."We're not surprised firefighters have decreased lung function.Bandanna: Wild-land firefighters wear nothing but a thin cloth on their face to protect their lungs from smoke.His group, which includes all federal and state agencies involved in wildland firefighting, now gets less than half the research money it received 15 to 20 years ago.Lead, found in high concentrations in smoke from Southern California wildland fires, can cause neurological damage.Because the camp offered no respite from the smoke, the firefighters breathed it 24 hours a day for several weeks.But because no mortality studies have been funded, all they have is the old joke heard around the fire camp: Just try to find a wildland firefighter still breathing after 60.Wildland firefighters, whose only protection is the cotton bandanna covering their faces, lose as much as 10% of their lung capacity after one routine season, and the damage persists for weeks, according to the studies by the California Department of Health Services and the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore.The Johns Hopkins tests, conducted on 52 Northern California wildland firefighters during the 1988 season, showed that their lung function -- or flow of oxygen -- remained reduced by as much as 3% even eight weeks after exposure.During the four months of fires in 1988 at Yellowstone National Park, 12,000 firefighters sought medical aid for respiratory problems, and about 600 needed a doctor's care after returning home, a U.S. Forest Service report says.National fire officials say they cannot get help from Congress unless they can prove firefighters are dropping dead.Fire officials say they haven't found lightweight respiratory equipment that is effective and safe for the crews, who have to trek uphill wearing 60 pounds of equipment.We just wanted to document it so the firefighting agencies would take action," said Dr. John Balmes, a pulmonary specialist and occupational health expert at UC San Francisco who helped with the state's study.But our studies show their lungs aren't back to normal," said Dr. Robert Harrison, the California health department's chief of occupational health surveillance and the physician in charge of one of the studies.The worst doses of carbon monoxide and other hazardous chemicals, which can be fatal, are given off when fires smolder, the stage in which firefighters spend most of their time, said Darold Ward, a U.S. Forest Service chemist.This year, about $10 million, less than 1% of the federal dollars spent on fighting wildland fires, is set aside for research.Mark Linane, who heads a national firefighting crew known as the Hotshots, said he has seen wildland firefighters so poisoned by carbon monoxide that they can't decide which shoe to tie.Harrison said the forestry agencies and fire departments should at least warn their crews -- and potential recruits -- of the danger and consider rotating shifts more often to reduce smoke exposure.In what was called the "Siege of '87," 1,500 fires attacked the Klamath National Forest near the California-Oregon border in one month.Dr. Patrick Ford, then a medical resident specializing in occupational health, looked at the firefighters' base camp, which was engulfed by a thick fog of black smoke."It's a crime that we continue to let these guys function like this," said James Johnson, director of hazard control projects at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Northern California, which is developing respiratory gear for its firefighters.The firefighters' union, concerned that crews were falling ill in record numbers, asked Johns Hopkins University to send a doctor.But the new health studies have documented physiological changes in the lungs and airways that do not vanish with the smoke.
