Jerry Goodwin, president of Reese Coffee Houses in Denver, sees nothing but "harmful effects."Nearly 3.5 million hourly workers earn the minimum wage, according to the Labor Department, but it's expected that any increase would also benefit the nearly 1.5 million workers who are paid below the minimum and others who earn slightly above the minimum.The chamber claims that 644,000 jobs were lost as a result of the last minimum-wage increase.He and others concede that increases in the minimum wage do result in some job losses.It would "cost jobs . . . drive up prices and decrease services," asserts Mark de Bernardo, manager of labor law for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Now, someone working full-time at the minimum wage earns $6,968 a year, or $1,773 less than the 1986 poverty threshold of $8,741 for a family of three.Hawkins: "The cost of living has gone up tremendously since the minimum wage was last raised.Employers say they'd have to raise wages for other workers, and costs would inevitably be passed on to the consumer.He asserts that the inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage is now at the lowest level in 33 years.If the wage is boosted, warns Anne Papa, a National Restaurant Association official, "employers will be forced to cut back on their work forces.""It is not the head of the household who is earning minimum wage," he says.Conceived as part of the New Deal, the minimum wage was heralded at its birth as "one of the most notable advances in our national effort to improve economic conditions in the United States."But pressure is building among Democrats in a Congress they now control to raise the wage, which was last increased six years ago.His research shows that income from the minimum wage was enough to raise a family of three out of poverty during most of the 1960s and 1970s."If we see a minimum-wage increase, that number is going to increase dramatically."
