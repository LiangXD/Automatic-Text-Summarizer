The damage is everywhere: in air, water, earth and fire.; Smoke and soot continue to pour from hundreds of oil wells set ablaze by the fleeing army of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.; KUWAIT; WAR-RAVAGED NATION IS SLOW TO REBUILD; KUWAIT is lacking in leadership, stripped of its workforce, gutted of supplies and apparently in little hurry to do anything about it.; Hundreds of homes, shops, offices, schools and power plants have been looted -- but not leveled.That toll includes: 100,000 to 120,000 Iraqi troops; 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians; 20,000 Kurdish and Shiite insurgents; and 15,000 to 30,000 refugees.; And a team from Harvard University recently visited Iraq and forecast that more than 170,000 children will die in the coming months from disease and war-related traumas.; BURNING WELLS; 500 FIRES STILL RAGE ON KUWAITI OIL FIELDS; Crews capped the 100th well last weekend in the smoke-darkened gloom of Kuwait's blazing oil fields, about 20 wells ahead of schedule.; Oil experts and firefighters are now predicting that at least half the 500 oil fires still blazing could be out by the end of summer.; The four companies fighting the fires estimate that it will take 13 more months to put out all the fires -- a much shorter amount of time than had been feared when the world first glimpsed the awesome spectacle of Kuwait's 600 burning oil wells.; The current pace of two wells per day is expected to slow in the coming weeks, however, as crews turn their attention to the most badly damaged wells.About 20,000 other Shiites are living in a camp in Saudi Arabia.; In all, roughly a quarter of Iraq's 19 million people were either routed from their homes or lost their jobs as a result of the gulf war, according to estimates from several relief agencies.; In the first major assessment of the war, the environmental group Greenpeace reported last week that as many as 221,000 Iraqi people died as a result of the war and its aftermath.About half the old workers were foreigners, especially Palestinians, who either fled the country during the war or have been ordered by the Kuwaiti government to stay off work because of alleged Iraqi sympathies.Only the autonomy talks with the Kurds are considered serious.; IRAQ; MONTHS OF SANCTIONS ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL; IRAQ'S economy was severely damaged by the war, and the trade sanctions imposed by the United Nations shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August are starting to take a toll.; Iraq is allowed to import food and medicine under the sanctions.
