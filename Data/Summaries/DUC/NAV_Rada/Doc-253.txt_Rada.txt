"Before the drought we expected a very solid year" for farm lenders, says Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank.President Reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program."Everybody is watching the dollars they have," says Allen Olson, a vice president of the National Bank of Harvey, N.D., where the drought has already halved the potential yield of the local wheat crop."The drought is going to hurt us because it hurts the cattle market," says Lance Shenold, a vice president of Anadarko Bank &amp; Trust Co.The decision by Mr. Lyng, the secretary of agriculture, to allow hay-mowing for 30 days on Conservation Reserve Program land came as farmers and ranchers in North Dakota, Minnesota and other states continued to sell off livestock in response to shortages of hay and other forage crops.He is hoping that drought damage and rising crop prices will fan inflationary fears so high that land again will be a hot commodity.The drought is also fanning wildly different predictions of how the farm economy will turn next year.While crop prices are soaring on weather-worries, yields may be so low in many areas that farmers won't do nearly as well as expected.If farmers are strapped for cash this year, the effects would ripple throughout the farm economy."This is probably putting a damper on one of the most optimistic years in the last eight years," says Richard Hahn, president and chief executive of an Omaha, Neb.-based farm management concern.The department said it won't allow livestock-grazing on land in the soil-conservation program, under which farmers are paid to take erodible acreage out of crop production."It's already getting harder to sell farmers tractors because of the drought," says James K. Ashford, Case president and chief executive officer.Mr. Lyng's order covers counties where livestock-grazing and hay-mowing on so-called set-aside acres already has been authorized, and the drought's effects have been rated as "severe.""I will be hurt a bit," says Mark Dadd, an economist who is buying a 420-acre farm in Missouri.The Reagan administration moved to deal with the worsening drought, and a top trade official said that farm export subsidies may have to be curbed.Now, with farmers in many Midwest states expecting smaller harvests this year, these businesses are seeing their new-found trade evaporating.White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the president is "very concerned" about the drought, and "wants to make certain that everything that the federal government can do to assist will be done."One of the biggest problems for farm banks has been that their number of loans, a major source of bank income, has shriveled as farmers paid off their debts with last year's profits.While he wouldn't predict what kind of disaster relief might be authorized, Mr. Fitzwater said the drought "certainly is going to drive up food prices.Before the drought began damaging crops this month, the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers.
