James Grogan also told the Senate Ethics Committee he remembers more than one occasion on which Cranston or his aides sought contributions from Keating while at the same time promising to assist Lincoln in its battle against federal regulators.-- In late 1986, when the Senate was considering legislation that would have imposed restraints on Keating's management of Lincoln, Grogan tried to contact Jordan, Cranston's aide on the Banking Committee, for assistance in battling the proposal.He said she repeated Cranston's contention that he had been "very supportive" of California thrifts and asked him if Keating would raise money for the senator.Grogan said Riegle, who was in line to become chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, had also insisted he himself could not attend such a meeting with the regulators unless he was invited by McCain and DeConcini, who represented the state where Keating lived.Grogan contradicted earlier testimony by Jacobson, who said that she -- not Cranston -- was approached at the 1984 Democratic National Convention by Grogan, who "offered to be helpful to the reelection campaign."He said that Keating, who eventually developed a warm friendship with Cranston, usually waited until the end of his meetings with the senator to discuss contributions.He said he later persuaded Keating to assist Cranston by telling him that the senator shared his negative opinion of then-Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray.It was the first of nearly $1 million that Cranston solicited from Keating -- $60,000 for his campaigns, $85,000 for the California Democratic Party and $850,000 for voter registration groups founded by the senator.Under questioning by special counsel Robert S. Bennett, Grogan detailed the following occasions on which he said Cranston or his aides allegedly sought contributions while at the same time pledging to assist Keating with regulators:At the same time, Grogan emphasized that Keating did not always have Cranston's support for his proposals.Grogan and Cranston then discussed Lincoln's problems, with Keating joining the conversation over the office speaker phone.In April, 1985, as a result of Cranston's appeal for funds, Keating collected $15,000 in checks from his employees for the California senator.Grogan contradicted testimony by Jordan concerning a written statement she inserted into the Congressional Record on Cranston's behalf in 1987 that assisted Lincoln in a pending court suit against the bank board.Grogan, 36, who was paid $300,000 a year to lobby for Lincoln, recalled that he introduced himself to Cranston at an event in 1984, explaining that he worked for an Arizona builder who had just purchased a savings and loan in California.Jordan told the committee she acted entirely on her own initiative, but Grogan said she was acting on his request.He said it was during Riegle's visit to Keating's headquarters in Phoenix in March, 1987, that the senator first proposed the idea of such meetings.Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) at a political event in 1984, the senator suggested Keating should contribute to his campaign.Grogan indicated he was surprised by this aggressive appeal for money because Keating is a conservative Republican who opposes abortion, and Cranston is a liberal Democrat who is an abortion rights advocate.Cranston then wrote Grogan's name and telephone number on the card, he said.
