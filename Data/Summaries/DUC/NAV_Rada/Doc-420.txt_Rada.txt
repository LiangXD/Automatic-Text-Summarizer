Huge new Disney-like facilities such as the 3,000-room Mirage and the 4,000-room Excalibur have forced the industry into a Darwinian struggle in which older, undercapitalized facilities are falling behind more modern competitors."The only reason Las Vegas has been booming is because it was on the periphery of Southern California."Las Vegas is an accident waiting to happen," says David Shulman, a Salomon Brothers economist who tracks real estate markets."With the California real estate market going down, I'm sure I couldn't have made my deal today," he says.What's more, the national credit crunch has saved developers from building projects with no prospect of success.While the twin engines of Las Vegas's housing growth -- the casino industry and the spillover from the California market -- are beginning to sputter, housing starts continue to climb."You must remember that the people who have been successful in this town have always had their feet on the gas pedal," says R."It's what I call the rule of 500," says Alan Pomerantz, a real estate attorney with Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges in New York City."We are now a mature and diverse community that just doesn't have the same reliance on casino gaming as it once did," boasts Don Haze, a commercial real estate broker who opened a Coldwell Banker commercial leasing office in 1981.Over the next year, builders have applied for permits to put up more than 49,000 housing units in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.Economists cite another disturbing trend in Las Vegas's growth pattern: A full 8.1% of all payroll workers are in the construction sector, suggesting that there aren't enough indigenous industries to pick up the slack once things quiet down.He cashed in on the California real estate boom last year and moved to the serenity of the Nevada desert, where he lives in Del Webb Corp.'s Sun City, a planned community.Still, Las Vegas isn't Phoenix, and there haven't been any billion-dollar thrift seizures or distressed land sales yet.
