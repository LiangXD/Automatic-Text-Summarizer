Bush was expected to authorize naval commanders to use "the minimum force necessary" to interdict shipments to and from Iraq, a U.S. official said.He also said of trade with Iraq: "There are no shipments at the moment."The Persian Gulf showdown between Iraq and the United States took a more personal turn Thursday when Iraq's Saddam Hussein called President Bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war could bring thousands of Americans home in coffins.Bush, commenting on the two-week-old gulf crisis from his vacation home in Maine, said he saw little reason to be optimistic about a settlement of the dispute, which stems from Iraq's invasion of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the border of Saudi Arabia.Bush's chief objective in his meeting with Hussein was to press the king to shut down Iraq's food and oil supply route from Aqaba on the Red Sea.In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Iraq has continued to increase its armed forces in Kuwait and they now number about 160,000.Reports attributed to the Japanese foreign ministry said Saudi Arabia told U.S., European and Japanese oil companies of a 15-20 percent cutback in its oil supply in September.After a two-hour meeting at his Kennebunkport home with King Hussein of Jordan, Bush said, "I did not come away with any feeling of hope" that Iraq would withdraw its army from Kuwait.In a long verbal attack read on Iraqi television Thursday, Saddam repeatedly called Bush "a liar" and said a shooting war could produce body bags courtesy of Baghdad.Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile said the Bush administration plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the region to back up the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force troops already in place in the gulf and the Saudi desert.An international land, sea and air force has mobilized since Iraq's invasion, which was sparked by disputes over oil, land and repayment of war loans.Meanwhile, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said Thursday that Saddam was the target of an assassination attempt, which led to "large-scale" arrests, including some close associates of the Iraqi strongman.
