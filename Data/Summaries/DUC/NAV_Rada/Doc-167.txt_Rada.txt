Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances there will be no damage to the British Columbia coast if the tanker is towed to Oregon, and the mayor of Valdez said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude.A boom wasn't placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it wasn't available in Valdez, Exxon officials have said."The Exxon Valdez accident has taught us that simply having a plan is not sufficient," the Alaska Republican said.Iarossi also said Exxon has changed its policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited, four hours before sailing.Meanwhile, Exxon said placing an oil-catching boom around the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line.Neil Goldschmidt said Tuesday there are "a lot of questions that need to be answered" before the Valdez is allowed in.The family of the fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, said the skipper wants to surrender but is awaiting advice from his attorney, according to Lt.Frank Murkowski, a champion of oil exploration in Alaska, asked that plans for drilling in Bristol Bay, the state's richest fishing grounds, be set aside until the industry can demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills.
