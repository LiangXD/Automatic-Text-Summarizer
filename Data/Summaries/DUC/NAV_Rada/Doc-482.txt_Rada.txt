There are many estimates of the potential employment cost of Labour's minimum wage.A 10 per cent wage increase is predicted to raise relative full-time employment by 25 per cent.International evidence is a better source of clues on the likely effects of a UK minimum wage.A recent study of the effect of extending the mainland minimum wage to Puerto Rico in 1974 found a more dramatic employment effect.Most US studies of the effects of the minimum wage over the past few decades have found a moderately negative impact on employment, mainly among young people.Its unemployment rate rose from 11.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent between 1974 and 1983, of which over one third is estimated to be a direct result of the rise in the minimum wage.
