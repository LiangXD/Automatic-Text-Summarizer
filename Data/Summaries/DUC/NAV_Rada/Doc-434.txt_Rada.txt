A Los Angeles judge Friday refused to reduce the $5-million bail for Charles H. Keating Jr., saying the Phoenix businessman is a flight risk after being indicted on 42 counts of state securities fraud and other violations.Klausner said that of all the factors to be weighed in determining a proper bail, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the risk of a defendant fleeing were the most important in this case.At the same time, Klausner reduced bail for three Keating co-defendants from the $1 million he imposed Tuesday when the indictment was unsealed against the former operators of American Continental Corp. and its former main subsidiary, Lincoln.Keating and the others also have known they were targets of state and federal criminal investigations for a long time and would have fled the country by now if they had wanted to avoid prosecution, their attorneys said.Klausner also said he was "troubled" by the way the district attorney has equivocated on the bail issue.Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to investigate Lincoln, said he was willing to let the defendants go without bail on Tuesday because he didn't want to face a difficult battle extraditing Keating from Arizona.While defense attorneys wouldn't say what they thought of the prosecutor's actions, other lawyers connected indirectly to the case scored Reiner for allegedly using the case and his changing views on Keating's bail to bolster his public image.Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner said Keating -- pursued by creditors, regulators and prosecutors for his role in the failure of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan -- has "significant reasons not to stay around."Reiner said that, though his office had no evidence that Keating would flee, "you can't escape the thought of Mr. Robert Vesco in a case like this."Keating had sought to have bail reduced to $500,000, an amount that could be paid by his family, Neal said."Mr. Keating is accused of cheating people out of their savings," Reiner said in a press conference after the hearing.On Wednesday, prosecutors said they were willing to recommend a reduction in bail to $1 million for Keating and $50,000 for the others.He said 17,458 small investors had bought $250 million in American Continental bonds at Lincoln.Ira Reiner, whose office has flip-flopped twice in its bail recommendations in the case, praised the decision not to reduce Keating's bail."We think (the decision) is unsupportable on the evidence that was introduced this week," Neal said.All three posted bail late Friday and were expected to be released during the night.After Klausner first ruled, Reiner said he then supported the bail set.
