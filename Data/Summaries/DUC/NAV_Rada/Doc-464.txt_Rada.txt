'At least one senior Chinese official has said to me he believes there is no change of restoring co-operation and trust unless and until we have a new governor,' says Mr Tsang.'Mr Patten is the governor and the representative of the Hong Kong British government,' says one senior Chinese official in Hong Kong.'We are not suggesting any change to the curriculum,' says Mr Tsang Yok Sing, a leading Beijing adviser in Hong Kong who is himself a school headmaster.It is hard to see how Beijing's desire to maintain a tight grip on the levers of power can be meshed with the traditional independence and professionalism of Hong Kong's civil service.Mr Tsang, a member of the Chinese government committee planning for the handover, says the provisional legislature will have full powers to make laws for an expected term of nine to 12 months.In Mrs Wu's view: 'There is no absolute guarantee for Hong Kong that the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration will be met.There is similar wariness among Chinese officials about the possibility that Britain may lay down financial obligations which only have to be met after 1997.Mr Tsang says of the final recommendations of the provisional legislature: 'I think it most likely that any substantial conclusion will be deferred until after next year's elections to see how things are.'Mr Patten is adamant that he is not leaving Hong Kong until he has discharged his duty.As the sense of change becomes palpable - with China's Citic taking the British trading company Jardine Matheson's seat on the board of the powerful Jockey Club, and Mandarin beginning to displace Cantonese on the government radio - it is now up to China to decide how smooth the handover will be, and the shape of life beyond.Take school text books, which have recently emerged as an issue because some pro-Beijing figures in Hong Kong do not believe that the current texts used in schools are sufficiently 'patriotic'.This decision is set to take Hong Kong into uncharted waters, and casts doubt over the continuity of the colony's legal system.Mr Zhou Nan, the most senior representative of the Chinese Communist party and government in Hong Kong, recently attacked Mr Patten's plans for a government-funded pension, saying: 'During the transition period, we should not casually transplant a costly Euro-socialist pay-as-you-go concept to Hong Kong without prudently taking into consideration similar western programmes' long-standing track record of grossly under-estimating liabilities and grossly over-estimating funding projections.'Some concrete evidence of this new realism is the agreement Beijing reached last month with Britain on the funding for Hong Kong's HKDollars 160bn (Pounds 13bn) airport development.The through train encapsulated the hope that those elected in 1995 to the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's 60-member law making body, would be able to serve their full four-year term, regardless of the 1997 handover.
