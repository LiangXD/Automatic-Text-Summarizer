Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado."Tornadoes are very rare in Japan," Fujita said.Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, but are more dangerous because they give pilots less time to react, Fujita said."It's a beautiful thing," Fujita said."Since then, my passion really went up," said Fujita, a professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes for 42 years and is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the violent storms.Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research."In Texas one time, five people were killed when they drove right into a tornado.He has studied tornadoes that have dropped houses into lakes, made off with one car and left another right next to it untouched, and moved whole flocks of cows and sheep -- which lived through the experience.Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953, partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country.He also developed the Fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes.When he saw his first tornado, he and a team of scientists were studying wind shear and its effect on aircraft.The National Transportation Safety Board has cited microbursts, a term coined by Fujita, as the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in the last 15 years, causing 577 fatalities.Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982.
