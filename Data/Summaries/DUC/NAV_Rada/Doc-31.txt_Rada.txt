Nearly one-quarter of 650 officers responding to a commission survey agreed that "racial bias on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and community," and in some cases "may lead to the use of excessive force," the report said.But the commission called for a shift away from the force's paramilitaristic, us-against-them style, and said the department must embrace the "community-based" policing style that encourages officers to spend less time in their cars and more time interacting with citizens in the communities they serve.Mayor Bradley said he hopes that Chief Gates's will "follow the commission's recommendations" to "commence the transition to a new chief of police.""This report will be a must-read for police chiefs around the country," said Hubert Williams, executive director of the Police Foundation, a Washington, D.C., law enforcement research group.More than 80% of the black, Hispanic and Asian police officers in the force are in the entry-level ranks, the report said.However, the commission didn't address how Los Angeles would pay for this major overhaul, though Mr. Christopher said that "when you see the costs of settlements accelerating" in police misconduct lawsuits as they have in recent years, "I'm not sure there will be a net cost" increase to implement the changes.A scant eight hours is devoted to cultural awareness training at the Los Angeles Police Academy, and many officers who train new recruits in the field openly perpetuate the "siege mentality that alienates patrol officers from the community," the commission concluded.But the most surprising part of the report was its recommendation that Chief Gates resign, after a transitional period in which he would begin implementing the commission's proposals.
