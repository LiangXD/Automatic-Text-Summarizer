Don Jackson, said he set up the self-styled "sting" in Long Beach to expose alleged police racism in the Los Angeles area.Jackson said he chose Long Beach police because of complaints to the Police Misconduct Lawyer's Referral Service of Los Angeles."I submit that if Mr. Jackson had stayed in the vehicle, as did the driver, this incident would not have occurred," Hawthorne Police Chief Kenneth R. Stonebraker said at a news conference Monday.But Jackson's boss said the black officer was looking for trouble.The 30-year-old Jackson, who has been on a stress-related disability leave from his Hawthorne job for 22 months, contends the incident is typical of a pattern of racism by white officers in the Los Angeles area."The officer simply used violence," Jackson said Monday.Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said on NBC's "Today" show this morning that he was disturbed by the videotape.David Lynn of the referral service said 50 misconduct complaints were filed with his group against the Long Beach police."I'm deeply concerned since it strikes me as a period when police violence and excessive force is rampant," said Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Los Angeles chapter.
