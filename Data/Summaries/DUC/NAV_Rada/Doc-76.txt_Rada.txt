The Air Force describes the A-10 as "a simple, effective and survivable twin-engine jet aircraft that can be used against all ground targets ...The plane is no longer in production, but the Air Force has more than 700 of them in its inventory.The Air Force later corrected that statement, saying the A-10 was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Alconbury.On the same day as the crash in Remscheid, an A-10 crashed near the heart of the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation, about 80 miles west of Tuscon, but the pilot ejected safely.The Thunderbolt II is also one of the safest planes, statistically, in the Air Force inventory.
