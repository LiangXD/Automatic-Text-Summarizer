We have argued continuously during these years that this argument was false, that the voters had indeed entrusted Ronald Reagan with a mandate (his campaign positions were clear) and that the losing side was trying to overturn the results of these elections.But history will note that at the moment Clarence Thomas was about to be destroyed by the old order, the American people came forward and by the millions confirmed his appointment to the Supreme Court.This doesn't mean that the American people support Judge Thomas -- or Robert Bork or Ronald Reagan -- in every detail of their political beliefs.It looks to us as if Clarence Thomas is the first Justice to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court with a popular mandate.They can't possibly have wanted the sexual harassment charge against Clarence Thomas to go before the entire American population.We don't doubt, however, that in terms of the presidency or the Supreme Court, voters are willing to risk disappointment on discrete issues if they approve the fundamental direction.Washington's reporters, who had already largely broken away from the editorial controls of traditional journalism, even broke away from the congressional staffs and special-interest groups, building the sexual harassment story into a bonfire of personal and political grievances.
