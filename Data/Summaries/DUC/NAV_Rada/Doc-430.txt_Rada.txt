"One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause," said Keating.The governor received $80,000 directly from American Continental and Lincoln Savings; $19,000 from Keating and his family members; $51,000 from other American Continental subsidiaries and executives; and $23,000 from Keating business associates.As attorneys, he hired fund raiser Samuelian and Franklin Tom, a former state commissioner of savings and loan who left public service to join Samuelian's Los Angeles law firm.Keating also paid $200,000 in 1985 for the consulting services of former Savings and Loan Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart, who had left government service in December, 1984, for a job with TCS Enterprises of San Diego.* Keating and associates gave $176,500 to other state political organizations and politicians.Along with the $173,000 donated to Deukmejian's campaign, Keating's family and business connections also contributed $176,500 over the two years to Democratic and Republican groups and such politicians as then-Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale and Gray Davis in his successful race for state controller.Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr., his family and his business empire poured nearly $350,000 into state politics during 1985 and 1986, with about half of it going to Gov.In California, Keating hired key Deukmejian supporters or appointees to help protect his ill-fated Lincoln Savings.The figures do not include at least $83,336 in contributions made personally or through the firms of two other Keating associates -- Los Angeles attorney Karl M. Samuelian and San Diego businessman Tom C. Stickel.In April, Keating's American Continental Corp. of Phoenix filed for bankruptcy, prompting federal officials to immediately take over its subsidiary Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.The governor has said that he met Keating only once and never knew of Lincoln's financial woes until he read about them in newspaper reports this year.
