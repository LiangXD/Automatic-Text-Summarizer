The lawmakers emphasized the increasing abuse of steroids by college, high school and even junior high school athletes who believe the substance will enhance their performance.Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knocked off track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids, says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance.Lewis dismissed reporters' questions that he had used steroids, indicating he would be willing to run against Johnson "if he comes back and he's clean."Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented the legislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlled substance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin.
