If preliminary reports that there was wind shear in the area are true, then "that would indicate there was some instability in the atmosphere," he added.This, in fact, may have been one reason why the load on the United flight was light.In Sunday's crash, the jetliner was a few miles from the airport and so should have been at a somewhat higher altitude.Moments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23 miles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, Mr. Hall said.Yesterday's marks the third crash of a United jet in the past three years.Although it has always been difficult to measure the effect of crashes on travel, this accident comes just as people were starting to get over fears of terrorism related to the Persian Gulf war.
