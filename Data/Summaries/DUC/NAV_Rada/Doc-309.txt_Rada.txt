Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who opposed the nomination, blamed the administration.; "I'm saddened that once again race was used as a tool for short-term political gain," Leahy said.; Thomas will succeed retired Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice and the Supreme Court's last link to the liberal Warren Court of the 1950s and 1960s.; As the youngest Supreme Court justice, Thomas is expected to remain on the high court for decades, long enough to grapple with anticipated 21st-century legal issues stemming from new reproductive technologies, gay and lesbian claims to family rights, experimental drugs, multinational business arrangements and other developments.; How they voted; Here is the 52-48 roll call by which the Senate voted to confirm Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.; (box) REPUBLICANS voting for (41):; Murkowski, Alaska Stevens, Alaska McCain, Ariz."Today the Senate sacrificed the integrity of the Supreme Court, its own reputation and the rights of American women to the Bush-Reagan agenda," the Women's Legal Defense Fund said in a statement released after the vote.; Thomas said he wanted to put his confirmation ordeal, which lasted more than three months, behind him.; "This is more a time for healing, not a time for anger or for animus or animosity," he told reporters in a brief interview outside his Virginia home.; "I guess in so many ways, as I say to my wife so many times, I'd like to thank America," he said.; In Norman, Okla., the woman whose complaints prompted the extraordinary weekend hearings on sexual harassment allegations against Thomas said she hoped his confirmation wouldn't stop others from complaining about harassment in the workplace.; Law Professor Anita Hill, once an aide to Thomas, declined to comment specifically about the Senate vote.Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said: "To give the benefit of the doubt to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge Thomas is more important than the Supreme Court."; Thomas' defiant and powerful response to the charges was, to many observers, a critical turning point in the hearings.; He refused to tolerate any further inquiries into his private life and portrayed himself as an innocent victim of "a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks" and "the most bigoted, racist stereotypes" of the sexual prowess of black men.; But several senators deplored the injection of race into the Thomas nomination.; Sen.Kohl, Wisc.; (*)The four Democrats who switched their votes from favoring to opposing Thomas were Lieberman of Connecticut, Graham of Florida and Bryan and Reid of Nevada.Alan Dixon, D-Ill., concluded in casting his ballot for Thomas.; The hearings on the harassment charges led only four previously pro-Thomas Democrats to change their minds and vote against him: Richard Bryan and Harry Reid of Nevada, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Bob Graham of Florida.; Sen.Thomas is expected to join the high court as its 106th justice next week, becoming the seventh conservative on a nine-member court already embarked on a counterrevolution against many liberal rulings of the past.; Eleven Democrats joined 41 Republicans to produce the slim majority in favor of the 43-year-old federal appeals judge.; It was the closest Senate confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee since Lucius Q.C. Lamar an appointee of President Grover Cleveland, also squeezed through by four votes in 1888.But, she said, if she had it to do again, she still would have testified against Thomas.; "My gut reaction is that it was the right thing to do . . . and even looking at how hard it was, I would do it again because it was the right thing," she said.; If Thomas is sworn in, as expected, on Monday, he will have missed oral arguments in 20 cases, including high-visibility disputes over school desegregation and abortion.Kerrey, Neb.; Bryan, Nev.(*) Reid, Nev.(*) Bradley, N.J.
