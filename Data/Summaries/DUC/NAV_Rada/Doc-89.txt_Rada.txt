Even lower levels of outdoor air ventilation, below 10 cfm, have become common since 1973, the post-oil embargo era.; In the study, Nardell estimated that if outdoor air ventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic feet per minute, a level that Massachusetts recommends for buildings where smoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected with tuberculosis.; Other studies have documented:; (check) Flu spreads quickly on airplanes where ventilation systems consist entirely of recirculated air.; (check) Measles are transmitted by infectious air in a pediatrician's waiting room.; (check) Tuberculosis can spread in homeless shelters, prisons and hospitals where ventilation is poor.; Flu spreads much more easily than TB.Respiratory infection experts say that flu viruses and measles are easier to spread than TB.; "This particular study deals only with TB," says Dr. Jonathan Samet, a respiratory-disease expert at the University of New Mexico, "but the observations may apply to other organisms, such as the respiratory viruses that cause flu."; Building workers had complained for years about poor air quality.; The building's ventilation system permitted circulation of some outdoor air -- 15 cubic feet per minute -- a low level commonly found in buildings since the 1930s.The evidence comes from various studies of tuberculosis, measles and flu that spread in a manner that can only be explained by poor air ventilation.; "Modern office buildings are tight," says Jon Rosenberg, public health officer in California's occupational health program.So the infectious bugs that a worker exhales at one end of the building can end up, via the ventilation system, being inhaled at the other end.; "The building is not the source.
