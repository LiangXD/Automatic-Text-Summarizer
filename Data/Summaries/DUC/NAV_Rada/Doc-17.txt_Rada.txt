THERE are growing signs that Hurricane Andrew, unwelcome as it was for the devastated inhabitants of Florida and Louisiana, may in the end do no harm to the re-election campaign of President George Bush.In the process, Mr Bush has been able to call on the power of incumbency, the one asset denied his presidential rival, Mr Bill Clinton, who is to visit Florida today.As if to underline the political benefit to the president, a Harris poll conducted from August 26 to September 1 yesterday showed Mr Bush with 45 per cent support - behind Mr Clinton by just five points - reflecting a closer race than other recent surveys.Contrary to its brief, but confirming a prescient recent report by a House committee that Mr Stickney was 'uninterested in substantive programmes', FEMA was caught completely unprepared by Andrew, resulting in unseemly disputes between state and federal authorities over who did what in bringing relief.
