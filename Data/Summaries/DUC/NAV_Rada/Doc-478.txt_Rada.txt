Bush's stand puts him in opposition to the head of the Labor Committee, Edward M. Kennedy, who said Thursday he remained opposed to a training wage and was confident his bill to raise the minimum hourly wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 would pass this year.In a brief interview after the hearing, Kennedy, who introduced his minimum wage bill Wednesday, said "my views haven't changed" and that he would try to get the bill through the Senate without a provision for a training wage.Bush during the presidential campaign said in one interview that he supported some increase in the minimum wage, provided it was coupled with the training wage, although at other times his campaign said Bush was against an increase.
