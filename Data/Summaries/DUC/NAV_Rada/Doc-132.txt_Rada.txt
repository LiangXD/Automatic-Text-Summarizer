It was the same spot, the corner of Wells and North Avenue, that Weidenbach had taken the lead in last year's race.At 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun."I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went," Davies-Hale said.Following him, and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the Soviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British Midlands, who was third in 2:13:37."I was concentrating on running five-minute miles," he said.In the women's race, Weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with that handicapping.It was the slowest winning time in this race since 1982.Davies-Hale may have shown a liking for running in heat when he won the Boulder Bolder that year in terrific heat.Among the men, Paul Davies-Hale of England proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever."To be honest with you, I was afraid of Cathy (O'Brien)," she said.Race director Tim Murphy said the race was not selected by The Athletics Congress, which governs the sport, to conduct testing. . . .Given the heat, the humidity and the wind, Weidenbach's time might have been as much as two minutes faster.Davies-Hale caught the second pack at 13 miles and met up with pre-race favorite Steve Binns, who lives 30 miles from Davies-Hale in England's West Midlands.After a week of summer-like weather, race organizers hoped to be salvaged by a good race; to have, if not impressive times on this flat and fast course, at least a memorable race.By comparison, last year's race was 30 degrees cooler at the start.The race conditions were simply more bad luck for the 12th running of Chicago's marathon, which has been fighting for respectability since losing its sponsor in 1986 and staging no race in 1987.O'Brien was third in 2:31:19.
