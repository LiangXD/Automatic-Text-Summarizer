"What we're doing here is pretty much what we were doing before (at Drexel)," in the sense that his focus is on finding ways for companies to raise capital, Milken says, although he no longer trades or underwrites securities.Milken, who was one of the most feared competitors on Wall Street when he was at Drexel, now frequently is funneling to other firms the trading and underwriting business that he can no longer do himself.Milken says his firm expects to help salvage some of the large companies that have been in the news in the last couple of months because of severe difficulties in meeting the payments on their junk debt.Milken won't comment on the terms on which ICAG is helping these companies, but one deal that fell through suggests that, while his aim may be to help others, he isn't neglecting his own interests.And it is working on finding new capital for successful companies and refinancing firms that are in trouble.Milken says ICAG plans to do this for other employee-owned companies as well, since many of them have trouble raising the money to buy equipment outright.In an off-the-record interview, the chief executive of a publicly traded company who was a client of Milken's at Drexel and praises Milken effusively said that he couldn't afford to have any formal business relationship with ICAG.When Drexel's former junk bond chief announced plans for the firm, he said it would help members of minority groups and unions raise the capital to own companies.But Milken maintains that he is simply doing what he has always done, advising companies to profit from market conditions.But one clue to the amount of money that Milken personally is committing to the firm is how much he says ICAG is willing to invest in an individual transaction.Milken says that, in all, he has been approached by several hundred companies.Officials at the new firm say they are aren't making overtures to lure Drexel employees to ICAG.He says that 12 of these already are at the point where a transaction has occurred or is about to.Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, says the firm hasn't lost any clients to ICAG.Oscar U. Mutz, president and chief executive of Forum Group, an Indianapolis developer of retirement communities that is a Drexel customer, says: "I don't ask Drexel's permission to go see Morgan Stanley (another Wall Street investment bank), and I don't ask Drexel's permission to go see Michael Milken or anybody else."Milken and staff members say they are hoping for the best and, no matter what happens, they expect ICAG to remain in business and grow.Investment banking sources say that Milken, in effect, also is closed out of doing work for the gambling industry, which made up a big share of his clients at Drexel.One ICAG staff member says Milken's old competitors today are more than happy to do business with him, now that he's no longer directly competing.And in a long interview in ICAG's offices, Milken confirmed that a significant part of ICAG's business will be with ordinary companies.At Drexel, Milken essentially created the market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, and he revolutionized the way that capital was raised for medium-sized U.S. companies.In the short time since ICAG was formed, it already has purchased $2.5 million worth of barges and other equipment to lease to Unimar International Inc., a Seattle-based shipbuilder and tugboat company that was bought out by its unionized employees with Drexel's help in 1987.Milken says that helping unions and members of minority groups, and devising ways to help indebted countries, such as Mexico, will make up more than half of ICAG's business.Since leaving Drexel, Milken has had talks with many of his old firm's clients, according to a senior Drexel executive."The reality is that we can generate a lot of business for people," the staff member says.He is working on bailing out Weintraub Entertainment Group, a Los Angeles company that was straining under its junk bond debt after a string of unsuccessful movies.Several times during the interview, the man who earned $550 million in one year at Drexel, and is estimated to be worth well over $1 billion, complained that "people are so hung up on money."When Drexel settled a massive SEC lawsuit, the firm agreed not to do business "directly or indirectly" with Milken.Only the firm's name, not Milken's, is on the door.It's not clear, for example, whether legal problems would arise if a company hired Drexel to underwrite securities according to a recapitalization plan drawn up by Milken.Asked if it bothers him that he can no longer issue new securities, Milken says, "it's not something I'm thinking about at this time."
