I'm here today to explain to the people of Iraq why the United States and the world community has responded the way it has to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.The United Nations has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish the Iraqi people, but as a peaceful means to convince your leadership to withdraw from Kuwait.But even worse, others are being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.Because of Iraq's aggression, hundreds of thousands of innocent foreign workers are fleeing Kuwait and Iraq.When Iraq returns to the path of peace, when Iraqi troops withdraw from Kuwait, when that country's rightful government is restored, when all foreigners held against their will are released, then, and then alone will the world end the sanctions.In fact, the occupation of Kuwait is helping no one and is now hurting you, the Iraqi people, and countless others of the world's poor.Here is the text of President Bush's address to the people of Iraq, as released by the White House:I do not believe that you, the people of Iraq, want war.Iraq must get out of Kuwait -- for the sake of principle, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the Iraqi people.Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and America.That decision is in the hands of Saddam Hussein.Saddam Hussein tells you the occupation of Kuwait will benefit the poorer nations of the world.Let me say clearly, there is no way Iraq can win.Today, two years later, Saddam has invaded and occupied a member of the United Nations and the Arab League.And the world met Iraq's invasion with a chorus of condemnation, unanimous resolutions in the United Nations.My purpose is not to trade accusations, not to escalate the war of words, but to speak with candor about what has caused this crisis that confronts us.When we stand with Kuwait against aggression, we stand for a principle well understood in the Arab world.
