Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley, was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance.Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the state still needs "a good year to get back on our feet," Hauck said.Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been just $6,300.Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into Iowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said.But drought aid cut farmers' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a North Dakota State University study found."It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster," said Dwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist.Two reasons why: more acres of wheat were planted this year, and farmers don't have grain reserves to sell at high prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden.About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms in Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres.Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other drought-ravaged states, including Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin."I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area," Grindberg added."Disaster aid is political," he said.Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, he said, "I was able to mark time in '88. ..."If it hadn't been for drought aid, the economic situation all through North Dakota would have been disastrous.
