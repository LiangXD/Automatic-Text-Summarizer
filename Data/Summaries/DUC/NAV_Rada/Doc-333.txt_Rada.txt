Sununu embodied the barbed-wire side of Bush's politics; in many critical ways, he was an accurate reflection of the way Bush believed things should work.; During the 1988 campaign, Bush conceded in interviews that he had to do some of the dirty work in attacking Dukakis; his alternating nice and nasty faces came to be known as "George the Gentle" and "George the Ripper."; But as president, Bush preferred to farm out to aides the duties of bully and gunslinger.; By making the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire his chief of staff, Bush hoped that he could keep a certain balance of rough and smooth in his governing and in his politics.; In the many times over the past three years when Sununu helped land the president in the political soup, the Washington political cognoscenti speculated that Bush was keeping his chief of staff only out of loyalty to Sununu for helping him win the New Hampshire primary, or because Bush was too nice to fire anyone, or because he was too indecisive.; The truth is more complicated, and Sununu put his finger on it Tuesday.Sununu even tried to manipulate his boss on occasion, with the effect that Bush looked weak and waffling.; When the glow faded from the Persian Gulf war, and the country began looking to the White House for leadership on the stagnant economy and the pain of many Americans, the president once again allowed himself to be guided by Sununu and his closest White House ally, Richard Darman, the budget chief.; Sununu and Darman urged the president to follow his instincts that there was nothing he could do about the economy and that he should not even try to come up with a drastic plan.; Moreover, in the recent fiasco about caps on credit card interest rates, Sununu did something that is never done in a city that operates strictly on hierarchy: He blamed the mess on his boss, going on national television to say Bush had "ad libbed" the idea in a speech.; Bush appeared out of sync with the country.
