Carlucci says that Powell has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that Reagan got Powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the general had turned Carlucci down several times.Gen. Colin L. Powell, who is expected to be named the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is described by colleagues as a "soldier's soldier" who doesn't particularly like staff jobs."Colin gets mad at me when I say this, but I think he should go to the very top of the military establishment _ up to and including chairman of the joint chiefs of staff," Carlucci has said.On the job, Powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he became FORSCOM commander.The four-star Army general, who became national security adviser in 1987 and heads the U.S. Forces Command at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, would become the first black to serve as the nation's senior military officer.A senior administration official said in Washington on Wednesday that President Bush is expected to name Powell to the position.
