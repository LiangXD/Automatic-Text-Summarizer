Crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. Maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s.Cotton deliveries are forecast at less than 90,000 tonnes, down from 205,000 tonnes in 1991, soyabeans at 30,000 tonnes (133,000 tonnes last year), while winter wheat production is expected to fall to less than a third of normal levels.The country's textile and clothing industry - the main exporter of manufactured goods - has warned of production cutbacks and lay-offs unless it is allowed to import cotton this year.Following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, exports of farm produce in US dollar terms will be sharply lower, with tobacco earnings of less than USDollars 500m, compared with Dollars 520m in 1991 (28 per cent of total exports).Compensatory funding will be available from the International Monetary Fund, but when this and other aid commitments are taken into account there is certain to be an unfilled gap in the region, which for Zimbabwe will mean diverting other aid funds and export earnings to pay for food.Flue-cured tobacco accounts for just over half of this, and while there is likely to be some modest growth in the value of its output this year, the rest, with the exceptions of beef and horticulture will fall catastrophically; so much so that, in real terms, farm output in 1992 is projected to slump to its lowest levels for 30 years.
