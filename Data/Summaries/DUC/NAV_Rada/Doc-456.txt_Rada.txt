Although Mr Patten did not say so yesterday, he has suggested in the past that he would be prepared to introduce his proposals for a slightly faster pace of democratic development in Hong Kong without China's approval.MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday gave China until the end of the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.This is Mr Patten's first visit to China as governor of Hong Kong.After more than six hours of discussions with Lu Ping, director of the Chinese cabinet's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, Mr Patten said: 'I cannot say we reached a meeting of minds on what I put forward.'
