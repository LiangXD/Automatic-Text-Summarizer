If the funds are used productively, debt service is not a burden in the critical sense that the debtors would be better off if they had not borrowed.Sir, Mr James Skinner (Letters, April 11) charges me with misuse of statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries.This is like saying that banks, building societies, and governments issuing saving certificates are burdened when they pay interest.As I said in my letter, harping on alleged western causes of Third World poverty reflects and reinforces feelings of guilt, which is a self-centred sentiment.
