Five weeks ago, in his triumphant speech to Congress, President Bush said that "our commitment to peace in the Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait."Since Mr. Bush has just succeeded in turning the U.N. into a useful instrument for enhancing world order, he can't let Saddam Hussein steal his success.Even though the Bush administration's response to the new challenge has been mysteriously slow and inept, Saddam Hussein's most recent depredations have killed his last chance to plead for "magnanimity in victory," or to posture himself as the "lesser evil," who would, at least, give us the blessings of "stability" in Iraq.The U.S. is committed to support the U.N., and the U.N. is now committed to inserting itself deeply into the internal affairs of Iraq.When Saddam Hussein is told to hand to the U.N. a list of all his prohibited weapons as a first step in complying with the ceasefire, he might well respond by arguing: (1) Iraq never had any of these weapons, (2) if it had, American bombing raids have destroyed every one of them, and (3) if there were remaining weapons, all records have been burned by Kurdish terrorists.If international security guarantees were to fail in this instance, the deal that could be offered to Israel would no longer be "territory for peace," but territory for a worthless U.N. document.Saddam Hussein may not realize it, but as he begins to obstruct, violate and sabotage the U.N. implementation of the ceasefire agreement, he must take on not just some bureaucrats at U.N. headquarters and the U.N. flag.It is most implausible that Saddam Hussein could survive as Iraq's dictator and comply with these terms.
