About 4 percent of Americans identified as having the AIDS virus also have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis, said Dr. Dixie E. Snider Jr., director of the division of tuberculosis control at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.Snider also said doctors should administer TB tests to all persons testing positive for the HIV virus since TB may not be readily diagnosed in AIDS patients.In parts of Africa, where AIDS is already a health risk, tuberculosis has become epidemic, said Dr. Annik Rouillon, executive director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease in Paris.Snider stressed that tuberculosis, unlike AIDS, is a curable disease and called for TB screenings at drug rehabilitation programs, prisons or other places where AIDS tests are being administered.In Wyoming, the Centers for Disease Control recorded no new cases of TB in 1989, demonstrating that it is a condition that can be controlled and cured, according to Dr. Lee B. Reichman, director of the pulmonary division of the University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey.Snider said there has been a 150 percent increased in cases of TB among young blacks in New York City.
