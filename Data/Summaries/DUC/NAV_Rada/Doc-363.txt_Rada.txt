Judge Bork had to explain that, yes, there are all kinds of privacy rights in the Constitution (the First, 4th and 5th amendments, for example), but he didn't believe there is any "generalized, undefined" right.Judge Bork isn't Justice Holmes, though he is probably one of the half-dozen best qualified Supreme Court nominees since Holmes.If Robert Bork's Supreme Court confirmation hearings this week can be said to have had a moment of epiphany, it came Wednesday morning.If Judge Bork is not confirmed, however, the record of this week suggests that the reason will result less from his own failings than from the ferocity and distortions of his opponents.Judge Bork explained -- as he has dozens of times before -- his moral dilemma in seeking as solicitor general to follow the orders of a president, yet also keep the special prosecutor team from disbanding.That is when Judge Bork was explaining to Sen.Simpson has a searing wit, but the unfunny truth is that, having written that phrase, even the eminent Justice Holmes would have trouble making it through the political swamp that passes for today's Senate confirmation process.Judge Bork explained that he was concerned at the time about government coercion in private decisions, but that he had retracted that position more than a decade ago.He is surely the most prolific, as well, and so the capital's standing army of activists and senators has this week been busily replaying everything he ever wrote or said, all in an attempt to prove he is a judicial extremist, a threat to the republic.The same ads implied that Judge Bork had no objection to "sterilizing workers," didn't believe in any right to privacy, and just might "Turn the clock back on civil rights?"Judge Bork defended himself well this week, with scholarly precision and often with humor, but in Washington reasonableness alone is not enough to win a seat on the Court.
