In California, about 190 firefighters battled a wildfire that burned 350 acres of brush Tuesday across steep terrain in an area of Los Padres National Forest untouched by fire in 64 years, said Earl Clayton of the U.S. Forest Service.But Dwight Barnett, a spokesman for the Tennessee Division of Forestry, said there were 26 wildland fires on the Fourth of July, which burned just 113 acres.Firefighters also battled two smaller fires that broke out on the Upper Peninsula Tuesday, burning 220 acres, Department of Natural Resources spokesman Bob Heyd said.The evacuation in the Bridger-Teton forest was a precaution and the fire started to die down somewhat as temperatures dropped at nighttime, forest spokesman Fred Kingwill said.Phil Jaquith, Beartooth District ranger for the forest, said Forest Service policy is to allow wilderness fires to burn unless they threaten trails or structures or are about to spread outside the wilderness boundary.A fire that scorched 1,130 acres in and around the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan was linked to a vehicle exhaust pipe.Kentucky's Division of Forestry reported 85 fires burned 1,267 acres in the first four days of July, compared to an average of 18 fires and 165 acres for the whole month, spokesman Richard Green said.
