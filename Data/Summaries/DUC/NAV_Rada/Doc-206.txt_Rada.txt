Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.Management sources at TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the "Chunnel" - the Channel Tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when British workers sent the probe through to French colleagues."This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island," said a construction union official.It's the first time we have air passing between the two tunnels," said Gordon Crighton, tunnel engineering manager.Tuesday's linkup in the service tunnel is described by the French as a "mouse ole" - a bore only two inches in diameter.The first coupling of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.Officials estimate the tunnel may carry 28 million passengers in the first year of operation, although Eurotunnel doesn't expect a profit until the end of the century.French workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their British counterparts and relayed the news to TransManche officials.
