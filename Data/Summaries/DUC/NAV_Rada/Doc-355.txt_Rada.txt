"We looked to the United States, we expected you to have the moral edge," says Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University.U.S. commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000.Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense.The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S. officials now say, was that they all would have required lifting economic sanctions against Iraq.U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over.Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley" that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait "imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq."But it has offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise of Saddam Hussein and the destruction of the Iraqi military, not just the liberation of Kuwait.Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military."I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter what happens," says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written extensively about Iraq.Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi territory as part of a "pincer" movement to trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but insisted, "The purpose isn't to invade Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate."President Bush's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait.American war planners have long assumed that the early stage of the ground attack, in which American forces would use their speed to sweep around Iraqi defenses and their strength to punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front line, would be the easiest part.If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year-long war against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S. and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much of his country's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins."So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success," said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces.There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages.
