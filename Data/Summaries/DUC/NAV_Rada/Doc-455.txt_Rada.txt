WHEN Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's newly-appointed governor, arrives in the colony in July he will find that, five years away from its reversion to Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong is thriving.But for the re-export trade, Hong Kong would have a visible trade deficit with the rest of the world because it is becoming more of a service area and transferring some of its manufacturing to south China.There have been cases of Hong Kong Chinese returning to the colony but this is hardly surprising given that their most popular destinations - Canada, the US and Australia - have all been suffering economic downturns.Yet Mr Patten's main task is to preside over the peaceful transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997.The economic integration of Hong Kong with China is, considering that it has occurred just over the past 10 years, nothing short of astonishing.Although the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future which Britain and China signed in September 1984 and the Basic Law which the Chinese parliament passed in April 1991 provide for the maintenance of Hong Kong's way of life and a 'high degree of autonomy', the colony's citizens have continued to vote with their feet, seeking the protection of foreign lands and the passports they offer.Today, Hong Kong's factory owners in Guangdong - the Chinese province bordering the colony - employ between 2m and 3m workers; Hong Kong supplies China with an estimated 40 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings by virtue of Chinese goods flowing through the colony, earnings of mainland companies in the colony and remittances by local people to families still in China; and, Hong Kong is the source of 60 per cent of foreign investment in China.Yet, in spite of the extraordinary economic integration that has taken place over the past decade, China, at a political level, divides Hong Kong society and politics.This integration is most visible in the way Hong Kong's trade has changed over the past six years.To judge by the stock market, property prices, and bilateral trade with and investment in China, Hong Kong appears to have come to terms with its future ruler.
