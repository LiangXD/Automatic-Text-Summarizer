"Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens," added Rep.Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens.Tim Valentine, D-N.C., contended that counting aliens "in effect, is granting representation in Congress to individuals who have entered this country by breaking the laws of the United States."The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills which would require the Census Bureau to figure out whether people are in the country legally and, if not, to delete them from the counts used in reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives.
