Eurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable without the high-speed rail link.But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits.Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services."There is in no sense a feeling we must have that link to make the tunnel successful.""If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have to decide how to provide complete links."A high-speed link which covers {only} part of the route proves to be fairly uncompetitive with other transportation modes," says Bill Steinmetz, vice president of transport for consultants Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. in London.As a result of Thursday's decision, the journey time to London from Paris will be about three hours -- 30 minutes longer than with a high-speed rail link.
