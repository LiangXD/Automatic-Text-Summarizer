"There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature," said Ed Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, where 600 children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 percent of the sun's surface at 10:50 a.m.A slight dimming was noticed in Seattle, where partly cloudy skies allowed a glimpse of the 56 percent eclipse at 10:10 a.m.CST in Minneapolis, and a measly 3 percent at 12:44 p.m.Several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the sun at 9:13 a.m.The percentage of the sun blocked out and time of maximum eclipse at other locations included 52 percent at 11:28 a.m.Solar telescopes yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western North America.
