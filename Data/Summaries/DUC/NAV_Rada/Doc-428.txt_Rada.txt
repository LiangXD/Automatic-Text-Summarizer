Referring to a Home Loan Bank Board memo that said Keating had attempted to have him fired, Crawford said he did not know of any such effort but added that he, like federal regulators, felt "beat up" by the Arizona businessman.Crawford said that when he took over the department in 1985, he found that his predecessor had allowed Keating to keep the original records of Lincoln Savings in Phoenix, leaving only incomplete copies of documents for California regulators in the Lincoln offices in Irvine.Wording Deleted Also during the hearing, state savings and loan examiner Richard Newsom said the state attorney general's office deleted wording in a December, 1988, cease-and-desist order against American Continental that could have warned investors not to buy the company's high-risk junk bonds.Crawford said he ordered Lincoln's files to be brought back to California after he discovered Keating had contributed $50,000 to Arizona's attorney general in an uncontested race -- a move that persuaded him that any action by California regulators would be resisted by their counterparts in Arizona.Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. was a "con man" who relied on lies and political influence -- "juice" -- to fool and bully regulators in charge of his ill-fated Irvine-based thrift, California Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford told an Assembly committee Wednesday.After the hearing, Samuelian said he helped set up Keating's meetings in February and March, 1988, with Transportation and Housing Secretary Geoghegan, a Deukmejian appointee whose agency oversees the state's savings and loan and corporations regulators.When Keating first took over Lincoln in February, 1984, he told state regulators one thing but all along planned to do another, Crawford said.Asked for a simple explanation of why Lincoln Savings failed, prompting a federal takeover in April that could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, Crawford said: "If I had to pick one reason, I would have to say that probably the owner was a con man.Samuelian, Deukmejian's campaign finance chairman since 1982, also said that he represented Keating at several meetings with state regulators.He said the task was made even more difficult by the phalanx of Keating employees and attorneys, who overwhelmed understaffed regulators."That was 54 places to hide the smoking gun," said Crawford, who added: "We were never on top of the problems of Lincoln Savings. . . .Keating was invited to attend the committee hearing but did not respond, Johnston said.Newsom said the wording would have been the "atomic bomb" to end the junk bond sales, which continued through early 1989.Instead, Crawford said, Keating used Lincoln's citizen deposits and sales of high-risk bonds as sources of cash for marginal land acquisitions in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Louisiana.Samuelian said he recommended the appointment of two successive state corporations commissioners -- both of whom subsequently approved the sales of high-risk junk bonds by Lincoln's parent corporation.In Washington, meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush had no immediate plans to oust M.Crawford said he tried to keep tabs of Lincoln with only one experienced examiner and two trainees.
