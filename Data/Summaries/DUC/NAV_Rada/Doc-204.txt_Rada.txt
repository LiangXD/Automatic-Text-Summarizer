"We will have the money to finish the project," says Alastair Morton, British deputy chairman of Eurotunnel, the privately owned Anglo-French company overseeing the work.Eurotunnel Chairman Andre Benard said the company has provided for any foreseeable problems, but stressed: "We always made it very clear that this was a risk project.""Britain becomes branch line of Europe," a Guardian newspaper headline declared after the government announced June 14 that it would not fund a high-speed rail link between London and the British end of the tunnel.It's been described as the largest current civil engineering project, a multibillion dollar link that will help revolutionize Europe's economy and physically end Britain's historic isolation, a dream born in Napoleon's day.While the French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link to their end of the tunnel, for example, state-owned British Rail is dragging.The project also has raised increasing hostility among many Britons, who fear it will provide an easy conduit for ills from the continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.In October, concern about the rising pricetag drove Eurotunnel's banking syndicate to freeze funds for three months until the company reached a truce with Trans-Manche Link, the consortium of 10 British and French contractors doing the construction, over responsibility for $1.7 billion in overruns.Eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent of Britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the first year.The French government, on the contrary, is spending roughly $2.8 billion building 210 miles of rail from Paris to the tunnel, with a branch to Brussels, where the EC is headquartered.
