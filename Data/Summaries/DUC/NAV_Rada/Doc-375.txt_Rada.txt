Two of the plates sink beneath the islands of Japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the Earth directly below Tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. </P> <P> Most other earthquake-prone regions, including California, only have to worry about two colliding plates. </P> <P> The threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is being reclaimed from Tokyo Bay to serve the needs of millions more who are flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity.Many of the new structures going up in Tokyo these days are built on filled land, and some people here hope someday to fill in the entire bay, making room for even more people and more buildings. </P> <P> If San Francisco was not an "exceptional case," that trend could prove disastrous, many experts believe. </P> <P> Tokyo University's Shima believes there is only one answer, and that is to reverse the flow of people into Tokyo. </P> <P> One group is proposing that the capital be moved out of Tokyo, hoping that the forced move of government workers will result in a lower death toll when the quake hits.The Bay Area quake suggested that Tokyo too may be much more vulnerable than experts had thought. </P> <P> For this and other reasons, Tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. </P> <P> A study last year by Japan's National Land Agency concluded that if a great earthquake -- magnitude 8 or greater -- should strike Tokyo in the middle of the night it would kill about 80,000 people.The Pacific and the Philippine Sea plates are being forced under the Eurasia Plate, and the two subducting plates collide directly beneath Tokyo. </P> <P> That dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, as well as about 1,000 smaller quakes every month. </P>Okada directs a research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. </P> <P> Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations beneath Japan are constantly active. </P> <P> The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the planet.Scientists are concerned that land reclaimed from the bay will be particularly hazardous because such soils amplify shock waves from earthquakes. </P> <P> Painfully aware of its problems, Japan is moving full speed ahead in earthquake engineering research, and the country is trying to develop the world's best earthquake warning system before the next great quake hits.Shock waves striking the bedrock are reflected back up toward the surface, extending the life of the earthquake. </P> <P> "The duration of the shaking is very long," said Oyagi, of the National Research Center for Disaster Prevention. </P> <P> Officials here know those conditions could add up to disaster for Tokyo, a belief that was reinforced by Kyoto University's Iemura when he returned from his tour of the San Francisco Bay Area after the Oct.But some experts believe Tokyo is already past due for a catastrophic quake, and scientists around the world are watching to see if Japan can win a race against time. </P> <P> The impact of a giant quake here could be felt around the world.
