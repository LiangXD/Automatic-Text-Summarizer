Terry Anderson's daughter pleaded for the father she loves but has never known to come home today, the day Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in Lebanon.Thank you," said Sulome, who was born 83 days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim faction in Beirut.Bush did not attend the ceremony, but said in a radio interview that "every day I'm President I have a heavy heart when I think of the hostages.""I intend to keep open lines of communications with all parties, including Iran, who have influence over hostage-takers," the President said in a letter to Peggy Say, Anderson's sister.Former hostages chained themselves to a tree in Paris to protest Anderson's captivity, and President Bush pledged to work for the hostages' release.A home without a husband or father is not a home, it's hell," the letter said.Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, is the longest-held of the American hostages in Lebanon.Lebanese newspapers also published a letter today signed "Sulome and Madeleine," from the girl and her mother, Madeleine Bassil, who wait in Cyprus for Anderson's release.Bush has declined to say he is optimistic that any hostages would be released soon.
