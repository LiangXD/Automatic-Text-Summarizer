White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked what he thought of Powell as a vice presidential prospect, said, "Colin Powell is a great American and would be an outstanding candidate for any position.Powell is the only current White House aide being mentioned as even a remote possibility to be Bush's running mate, although former chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. has been reported under consideration.Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, responding to a reporter's query, nodded toward Powell and said with a grin, "He's my candidate."Before he went to the Pentagon, Carlucci had Powell's job, and Powell was his deputy.Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., who is himself a potential vice presidential candidate, is among those who have mentioned Powell as a possible Bush running mate.At the White House as elsewhere, Vice President George Bush's search for a running mate has people guessing _ and now one of their own is part of the guessing game.
