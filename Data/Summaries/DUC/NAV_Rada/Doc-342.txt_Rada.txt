Critics say the environmental provisions will make science more expensive in Antarctica, already the costliest research site apart from outer space.Instead, in October, the Antarctic treaty nations approved a substitute that bars mineral and oil exploration for at least 50 years and requires environmental safeguards for research bases."We've been living on a tripod-geopolitics, future uses of Antarctica and research," says Guy Guthridge, an NSF Antarctic spokesman.Argentina and Chile claim parts of Antarctica as extensions of their countries, even though the Antarctic Treaty effectively makes the continent international territory.But the National Science Foundation, which runs U.S. bases, thinks that the government's commitment to Antarctica will wane, what with new restrictions on mineral development and declining Soviet competition."Many countries will resign their activities in Antarctica {because} there is no hope of profits in the near future," says Krzyzstof Filcek, a Polish ecologist who studies Antarctic marine life.
