Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation."We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products," Pyke said, "and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path.""All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models," said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service.To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane.
