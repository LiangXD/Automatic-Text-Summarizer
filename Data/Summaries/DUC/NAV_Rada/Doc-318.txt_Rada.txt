Declined to Speculate Milken said he isn't currently talking with any of his former colleagues at Drexel about coming to work for his new firm, but he didn't rule out that possibility.Friends of Milken's have speculated that one reason he decided to start a new firm now is that, since taking a leave of absence from Drexel, he has had an unaccustomed amount of time on his hands.For the time being, Milken's legal problems probably will prevent him from competing directly with Drexel, individuals involved in the legal cases said.Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, said: "Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad event."During the rare, on-the-record interview, Michael Milken said of the resignation: "After spending your whole life working for one company, it's a very emotional experience.""Junk bond" wizard Michael Milken officially ended his 20-year career at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on Thursday and said he will launch his own financial consulting firm while he awaits trial on racketeering and securities fraud charges."I can't predict what's going to happen in the future," he said.Charges Denied Harmon is said to have detailed knowledge of some of Milken's business dealings with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky.The timing of Milken's resignation appears to have been influenced by a Supreme Court decision last week that cleared the way for Drexel to complete its announced plan to settle civil insider-trading and securities fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Lowell Milken had been a lawyer with the Los Angeles firm of Irell &amp; Manella before he left in 1978 to help his brother run Drexel's junk bond department.Michael Milken is said to be owed at least $200 million.Milken said he decided to set up his own firm now because "to continue to help (people he has done business with or offered advice to), I need some vehicle to be able to help."A number of Milken's former colleagues at Drexel already have been granted immunity from prosecution and are cooperating with the government investigation.I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as part of the firm's settlement with the government, but I look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies."In a telephone interview, he said his new firm, International Capital Access Group, would offer a wide range of consulting services consistent with his personal interests and his previous work at Drexel.The SEC settlement's ban on Drexel doing business either directly or indirectly with Milken could be interpreted to mean that Drexel can't do business with clients advised by Milken."I think Michael is desperate to find something to do," a former Drexel colleague said.Lawyers for Michael and Lowell Milken are challenging provisions of the settlement agreement, including a requirement that Drexel withhold much of the brothers' compensation owed them for 1988.A source close to Milken said: "I think you'd have to take it on a case-by-case basis."Sources confirmed Thursday that another former Drexel employee, Reed Harmon, who had worked closely with Milken, was recently granted immunity in exchange for testimony before a grand jury.Michael Armstrong, Lowell Milken's lawyer, said his client hasn't decided yet where he will practice.
