Democratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor had spirited competition in 1984 when he won with 57%; this year he has no opponent at all.The polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way they can control Congress effectively is by limiting terms.Critics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not -- it's wrong to blame Congress for the now nearly 100% re-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for.In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won.In the current House it is 8%.Getting incumbents to reduce the advantages they have voted themselves is something like asking banks to leave their vaults unlocked.
