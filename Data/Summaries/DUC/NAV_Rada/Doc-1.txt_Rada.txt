The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that BSE was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s."I think it is a recognition _ not just of pressure from farmers _ but that the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100 percent compensation," said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of "BSE hysteria" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is "remote."
