Botanist Linda Leigh, who has spent the last three weeks literally in her element, called her stay in an experimental biosphere a success Wednesday but said she's ready to return to Earth.Ms. Leigh said she hasn't felt isolated because her support team is excellent."The one thing that I really do miss is just companionship," Ms. Leigh said Wednesday in a telephone interview from within the module, located on a ranch about 30 miles north of Tucson.When Ms. Leigh exits Thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days inside an airtight, 17,000-cubic foot glass-and-steel structure, she will have been the longest inhabitant of a completely enclosed ecosystem, with air and water generated and recycled independently of Earth's.2, Ms. Leigh has been in frequent daily contact with her outside support team by telephone, video conference, two-way radio and just looking through the glass windows.
