USS Vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as American officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai.While every available evidence including the transcripts read earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any warning, many have contended that in such a short and routine flight, the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency civilian frequency.Notwithstanding the fact that the Iranian air force had no F-14 operations in the morning of that unfortunate Sunday in or around the Strait of Hormuz, it may be noted that the military experts well-familiar with F-14 and its capabilities have held that F-14 could not have presented any serious danger to the USS Vincennes or any surface target for that matter.It is necessary to note that the area where the plane was attacked is well outside the declared war zones of the combatants.The plane was flying on a scheduled flight using the internationally established and published Amber 59 airway that is used at least 14 times a week, five of which between the same two airports.
