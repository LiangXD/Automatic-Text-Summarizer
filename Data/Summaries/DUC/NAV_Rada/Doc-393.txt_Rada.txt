After the bombing Friday, an FBI spokesman said the Rogerses' van was usually driven by Sharon Rogers, but two highly placed law enforcement sources told The Times that Will Rogers drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident about an hour before the blast.No Threats However, Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made against Rogers, the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship returned to San Diego.The Vincennes and Rogers received some "negative" mail last July, shortly after the Iranian plane was shot down, a spokesman said.He also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that her family had received no threats since the airplane was downed.When Sharon Rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the Iranian jetliner."It could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb," he said, "or it could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was trying not to get hurt.""That's all there was to it.He said that no special security precautions had been undertaken for Rogers, crew members and their families after the Vincennes returned to San Diego.He returned, drank coffee with his wife, and then Sharon Rogers, who usually drove the van, left in the vehicle, investigators said.Other Vehicles Undamaged Though the van was surrounded on three sides by other vehicles, none of them were damaged, witnesses said.Officials said Friday that a serious investigation of the call was never launched.A copy of the FBI document, obtained by The Times, said the Los Angeles FBI office had received an anonymous phone call alleging that the Syrian, identified as Farwan Abdin, was "involved in or responsible for the Flight 103 bombing over Scotland."A law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified, said Sharon Rogers told investigators that she pulled up behind three or four cars stopped at a red light at the intersection and then suddenly heard two popping sounds.However, a senior Defense Department official said that there was "no evidence" of a terrorist connection Friday, and some law enforcement officials described the bombing as "amateurish."The mail was critical of the Vincennes' handling of the incident but did not contain threats, the spokesman said."If she didn't get out like that . . . well, she was very, very lucky," one source said.He noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were planted on the vehicle or that only a small amount of high-intensity explosives were used."I believe she got out just as it blew," said Kurt Lent, a laborer who was walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded.However, two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed on the transmission under the van.He said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs apparently came from one or two explosive devices, and that the apparatus was connected under the van's transmission.Will Rogers III, skipper of the San Diego-based Vincennes, escaped unharmed Friday morning moments before a pipe bomb exploded under her van, igniting a fire that gutted her vehicle at a busy La Jolla intersection.That decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew.Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30 a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop.No other description of the car was available, but witnesses said there were four people in it.All 360 sailors assigned to the Vincennes were alerted by their commanders Friday morning of the bomb in the Rogerses' van and urged to take whatever precautions they deemed necessary, Huebler said.Hours after the 7:40 a.m. explosion, the FBI took control of the investigation, suspecting that the bombing might be an act of "domestic terrorism" linked to the Vincennes' accidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the Persian Gulf last July, killing 290.
