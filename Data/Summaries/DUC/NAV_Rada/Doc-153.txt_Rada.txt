Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used a muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field.James Worrall, a Canadian member of the IOC, said Johnson "has been killed" as an athlete."If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again, my brother is not on drugs," she said.Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today "in a complete state of shock," accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal."This is a blow for the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement," said International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch."Everybody uses drugs," said sprinter Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone.After Saturday's race, though, Lewis had said he couldn't understand how Johnson could run as fast as he did after looking tired in qualifying heats.
