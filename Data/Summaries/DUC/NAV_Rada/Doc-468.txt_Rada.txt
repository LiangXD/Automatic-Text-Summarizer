The Scripps doctors concluded that the medicine, called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA, "may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia."The new drug was developed at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., where doctors tested it on patients with hairy cell leukemia.A single round of treatment with an experimental new medicine appears to be highly effective against a rare form of leukemia and may help fight other kinds of blood cancer as well, says a study published today.
