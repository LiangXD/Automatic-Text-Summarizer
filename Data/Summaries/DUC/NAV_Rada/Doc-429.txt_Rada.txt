A review of campaign records by The Times shows that Keating, his companies and a circle of about 75 family members, associates and employees have showered more than $700,000 in campaign contributions on three dozen federal and state politicians over the last six years.Keating's contributions have come under increased scrutiny since his company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on April 13 and Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, its principal subsidiary, was seized by federal regulators the next day.Timing of Contributions In his case, he said, regulators are raising the campaign contribution issue to hold senators and congressmen in check while the federal agencies deal with Lincoln Savings."In the last five years, there's no question that it has been important that we help those who supported the business areas we were in," Keating said in an interview last week.One former executive of an American Continental subsidiary who requested anonymity said he made his only political donation ever -- $500 -- in 1987 because he was made aware by Keating that Sen.For Keating, campaign contributions are one way that the American political system is made more responsive to its constituents.'Concerned' About Seizure And one of those senators, Democrat Alan Cranston of California, said Friday that he intervened again a month ago by urging federal regulators to allow Keating to sell his embattled S&amp;L to a group headed by former Republican Rep."It's absolutely clear to me that Mr. Keating and his cohorts had lots of help from the highest quarters, both financially and politically," said Joseph W. Cotchett Jr., an attorney representing American Continental bondholders who may have lost $200 million as a result of the bankruptcy filing.All of the senators involved said there was no impropriety in taking money from Keating and his fund-raisers and then representing him in a dispute with agency officials, something they said they do for all their constituents.Likewise, four years later, Keating did not contribute to President George Bush's campaign, although American Continental gave $80,000 to the California Republican Party.The next day, federal regulators seized Lincoln, claiming that Keating and American Continental were operating the S&amp;L in an unsafe and unsound manner.Today, Keating contends that his contributions merely give him a fighting chance against hostile regulators who drove American Continental into bankruptcy proceedings because they didn't like his unconventional business strategies and his outspoken criticism of the regulatory structure.* Nearly $166,000 has gone to 11 members of the Senate and House banking committees, where deregulation of the savings and loan industry was conceived and implemented in recent years, much to the dismay of some regulators.Gottlieb said Riegle returned the money in March, 1988, only because local papers had written about it and the senator did not want it to become a campaign issue.Keating lashed out at those who would criticize him for legitimate fund-raising activities, saying the public is being "bullied into not contributing" to political campaigns by people who question every donation.Mondale "definitely has diverse views from me," said Keating, a conservative Republican.Riegle was one of five senators who met with regulators on April 9, 1987, to find out why a routine examination of Lincoln's financial condition was taking more than a year instead of the normal two to three months.Cranston said he was concerned that the seizure would adversely affect the Arizona economy and hurt American Continental bondholders, most of whom are Californians.Critics charge that Keating and associates have coordinated their contributions in a deliberate effort to buy influence with powerful politicians.An individual "does not suddenly become ineligible for any kind of constituent help because he's made a political contribution," Maynes said.John Glenn (D-Ohio) has picked up $34,500 from Keating's circle.Keating said he "never put the arm" on anyone to make contributions.Keating was born in Ohio, and American Continental is incorporated there.A fund-raiser on March 23, 1987, netted Riegle more than $70,000, which Riegle returned a year later after Keating's contributions became a public issue.* More than $52,000 has gone to the two California senators -- Cranston and Republican Pete Wilson -- who represent Lincoln's home base.He and the other senators denied that Keating's contributions influenced their actions on behalf of Lincoln.Many of the recipients of Keating's largess have been in positions to help him in his business affairs and his escalating encounters with savings and loan regulators.But critics contend that Keating has simply used donated dollars to get politicians to do his bidding.This money, which does not come under federal or state contribution limitations, was used for voter-registration and get-out-the-vote efforts that benefited Bush.The recipients of contributions from Keating's circle include liberal Democrats like Cranston and former presidential hopeful Walter Mondale.For example, 51 donations from Keating, family members and associates were made to McCain on the same day: March 17, 1986.
