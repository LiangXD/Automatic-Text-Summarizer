Abimael Guzman, founder of the rebel movement, has said of the slums and their people: "The immense masses of the shantytowns are like belts of steel that lock in the enemy and hold back his reactionary forces."Huaycan is one of the slums where Shining Path works hardest because it is just off the Central Highway, a strategic route through the capital's main industrial zone to the mountains.I have been in a shantytown where there is a Shining Path group, and the police are doing nothing about it."The highway ties Lima to the agricultural lands of the central Andes and Peru's most important mines, where unions threatened by the Shining Path have conducted a strike since late October that costs millions of dollars a day in export earnings.Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains eight years ago, are moving into the shantytowns that encircle the capital like a noose.His Maoist rebels, once secretive fanatics, are becoming a political force that seeks public support in Huaycan and the other makeshift communities where two-thirds of Lima's 7 million people scrape along."I doubt if you'll find any union leader ... who will declare he is a Senderista, but I'll bet you'll find many who are afraid to say anything against Sendero," an American labor adviser said on condition of anonymity.Shining Path has infiltrated 167 unions and neighborhood associations in the Lima slums this year, says a confidential Interior Ministry report obtained by The Associated Press.Guerrillas threaten and sometimes kill community leaders, establish "people's schools" and set up "street theaters" for propaganda, it said.
