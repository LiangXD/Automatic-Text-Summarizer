While short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since the second world war.Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions.An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in borrowing to fund the welfare state.And the demands put on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private provision of pensions and healthcare.Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support.In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these.Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.The strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by relating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age.Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes.But a new glue will be needed over the next 50 years if advanced economies are to pass beyond the welfare state.Increases in life expectancy have already increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions.Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would be needed to pay for pensions alone - and that on the assumption that the pensions do not increase in real terms.As with pensions, health systems have become more generous in the wake of economic growth - for example, including grafts and transplants that were previously regarded as experimental.Where the cost of welfare is jointly funded by employers - as in Germany - higher contributions are also increasingly resisted by business, which fears the consequences for international competitiveness of higher costs.The ageing of the population has also contributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions.But what most concerns those responsible for public finances is the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push costs upwards in the future.
