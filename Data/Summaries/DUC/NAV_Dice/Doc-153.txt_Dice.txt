James Worrall, a Canadian member of the IOC, said Johnson "has been killed" as an athlete.Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used a muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field."If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again, my brother is not on drugs," she said.Lewis has previously alleged widespread drug use in track and field."Everybody uses drugs," said sprinter Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone."This is a blow for the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement," said International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch."I feel sorry for Ben and for the Canadian people," he said today.
