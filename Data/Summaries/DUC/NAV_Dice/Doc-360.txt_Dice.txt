The president's nominee to become the 104th justice is a bear of a man.Judge Bork has been widely and sharply critical of the Supreme Court's 1964 decision establishing the principle of "one person, one vote."But the expectation, even among some Democrats, is that Judge Bork will be approved.It was that 1965 ruling that was the basis for the Supreme Court's 1973 decision recognizing a woman's right to an abortion, and Judge Bork's criticism of sexual privacy has caused alarm among women's groups over his nomination.In choosing federal Judge Robert Bork for the Supreme Court, President Reagan has tapped a leading architect of conservative legal theory -- and has ensured a tough confirmation battle in the Senate.He is a good friend of President Reagan's last nominee, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist used to stay with Judge Bork on visits to Yale.But it is Judge Bork's prolific and forceful writings as a law professor and judge that have earned him his reputation as an intellectual leader of conservative legal thought for a generation of law school graduates.Committee Democrats say they don't expect to start hearings until September, raising questions about whether Judge Bork would be approved by the Supreme Court's opening next Oct."He is a true judicial conservative," says Dennis Hutchinson, a University of Chicago law professor, "and that means judges are supposed to defer to the decisions of the legislature.""Unless Judge Bork can demonstrate to me that he comes to the court with an open mind, I would have some difficulty," said Sen.But in Judge Bork, appointed by Mr. Reagan in 1982 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the president has picked a rare judicial -- rather than a political -- conservative, a judge committed to a narrow role for the courts rather than to the Reagan administration's political agenda.And liberal Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, fearful that Mr. Reagan's choice may upset the Supreme Court's moderate balance, have made clear they will fight any candidate whose views about the Constitution and the courts are too conservative.Judge Bork is a difficult target, since his intellectual prowess is widely respected in legal circles, even by those who disagree with him.But he hasn't said how he would handle challenges to controversial precedents on which the Supreme Court is divided: abortion, affirmative action, school prayer and school busing, among others.Judge Bork returned to Yale from 1977 to 1981 when he practiced law for a year before he was nominated for the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.Kennedy yesterday suggested that the "Saturday Night Massacre" will be an issue, saying the president "should not be able to reach out of the muck of Irangate {and} reach into the muck of Watergate" for a Supreme Court nominee.The selection of the 60-year-old Judge Bork to replace retiring Justice Lewis Powell gives the president his third Supreme Court appointment and by far his greatest opportunity to alter the court's direction.Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a Judiciary Committee member, lost no time urging that Judge Bork should be defeated.In 1968, in a Fortune magazine article, he was strongly critical of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren, saying it "is in the process of descending in national estimation from a position above the battle to the status of a political institution."As a judge, he has devoted much of his energy to questions of what are proper issues for courts to decide, taking a tough view on when a plaintiff has suffered sufficient injury to bring a lawsuit.In 1973, President Nixon tapped him to be solicitor general, the Justice Department official who represents the executive branch before the Supreme Court.And it is those views that will be scrutinized closely by the Senate."There is tremendous potential for rolling back the gains we have made in civil rights and civil liberties over the past 30 years," said Judith Lichtman, executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund.
