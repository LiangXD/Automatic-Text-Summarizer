For Israel, there also would be unhappiness if Saddam Hussein's military machine isn't further dismantled in war.The survival of a still-potent Saddam Hussein would be a problem not only for President Bush but for many of America's chief allies, particularly Israel.But Mr. Bush also now seems caught in the gap between the formal war aims he and the United Nations have proclaimed -- which focus narrowly on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of Kuwait's rulers -- and the allies' unofficial desire to do away with Saddam Hussein's regime along the way.The announcement of the peace plan in Moscow occurred only hours after Saddam Hussein had delivered a defiant speech in Baghdad in which he seemed to dare the U.S. and its allies to launch a ground attack to drive his troops out of Kuwait.Those aspects of the plan might allow Saddam Hussein time to withdraw all his military gear, and to quickly rebuild his economy so that he can purchase new weapons.Above all, the U.S. will be unhappy that the plan would remove economic sanctions after only two-thirds of Iraqi forces are withdrawn.By bloodying the Guards now, the U.S. may hope to make it more difficult for Saddam Hussein to survive and cause trouble down the road, even if he is left standing when the war ends.But for precisely that same reason, some U.S. officials have grown increasingly eager to press on with the war to finish off Iraq's military machine while the chance is available.In fact, some military officials said allied bombing likely would intensify while diplomatic maneuvering continues so that more Iraqi targets can be destroyed before a possible cease-fire begins.The broader dilemma is that the proposal forces Mr. Bush to make a choice he had hoped to avoid: between the prospect of achieving the minimum goal of freeing Kuwait without further bloodshed, and the chance to crush President Hussein and his military might at the risk of a bloody ground war.He'll also want a timetable for withdrawal that would force Saddam Hussein to leave much of his weaponry behind, as well as assurances that the U.N. can continue pressing Iraq to pay war reparations.But the plan was vague on many details, such as just what the timetable for withdrawal would be.For the U.S., one of the public complaints is likely to involve the failure of the plan to comply with all 12 U.N. resolutions passed to compel Iraq to leave Kuwait.What's more, officials suggest that they have hoped not only to drive his forces out of Kuwait but also to deliver a death blow along the way to the elite Republican Guard that have been instrumental in keeping Saddam Hussein in power.U.S. officials have speculated all along that Saddam Hussein might choose survival over continued occupation of Kuwait when he thought his options were that stark.Syrian President Hafez Assad will be equally chagrined if Saddam Hussein, also a neighbor of Syria, is still around to make trouble.
