Of course, Mr. Kelley -- not to be confused with the other John Kelley, who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 -- isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32 minutes, 7 seconds.Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at Mr. Kelley: "It's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing.Though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the Boston Marathon, Mr. Kelley is the oldest to run it.Mr. Kelley aims to run till he is at least 100 years old.A two-time winner in Boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, Mr. Kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year -- as he has been for 15 years."Aghast is more like it," says Leslie Pawson, 86, a three-time Boston champion who ran against Mr. Kelley half a century ago.Mr. Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon -- his 60th Boston Marathon."The winners get a medal and $55,000," says Mr. Kelley."He's a strange man," says Laura Kelley, in awe of her husband's vigor.The 82-year-old Mrs. Kelley adds, "I just try to stay in his shadow, but I have a hard time even doing that."In 1928, when he was 21, he entered his first Boston Marathon but didn't finish.Though still going strong, Mr. Kelley acknowledges the marathon gets tougher each year.John Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare."This is my warm up: I empty the dishwasher, I set up the coffeepot, but I don't plug it in."I would have loved to run with the worst pair of sneakers on the market today," he says.But I'll tell you, the Boston Marathon -- with all those people waving -- is better than my birthday."Then we said, 'Oh no, this is nice Johnny Kelley.'
