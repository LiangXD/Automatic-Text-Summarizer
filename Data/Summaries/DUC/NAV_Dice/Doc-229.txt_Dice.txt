While most of River Ranch's gem diamonds are small, typically under half a carat, the mine has yielded some big stones, the biggest so far being 29.6 carats.INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River Limpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominates the diamond business, discovered but then let get away.The deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m tonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in March last year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them of gem quality, Mr Baxter-Brown said.The South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991 after it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about marketing the diamonds.
