"It is a challenging course," Swai said.Since then, however, Swai has won two races, the Coronado Half Marathon in July, which he finished in 1:04.50, and the Goodwill Games 10-kilometer run last month in Seattle.Also in 1989, Jones won the Twin Cities Marathon, placed second in Houston and third in Boston."The runner who is smart and thinks through it will be the one who is going to win.The course is considered by runners to be a difficult one -- so difficult, in fact, that most elite runners who train in San Diego stay away from the race.Jones, 32, finished the 1989 New York City Marathon second to Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway with a personal-best time of 2:27.54.
