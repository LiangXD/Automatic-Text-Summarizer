This year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United States is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases.The overall incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is 9.5 cases per 100,000 population, he said.It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis.There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the U.N. agency.Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday.But when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as it can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect numerous others.In New York City, which has the highest number of AIDS cases in the nation, the incidence is 36 per 100,000, Bloom said.An individual does not have to have a damaged immune system to contract an active case of tuberculosis.
