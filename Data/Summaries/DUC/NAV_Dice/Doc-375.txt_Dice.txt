The Pacific and the Philippine Sea plates are being forced under the Eurasia Plate, and the two subducting plates collide directly beneath Tokyo. </P> <P> That dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, as well as about 1,000 smaller quakes every month. </P>But some experts believe Tokyo is already past due for a catastrophic quake, and scientists around the world are watching to see if Japan can win a race against time. </P> <P> The impact of a giant quake here could be felt around the world.The Bay Area quake suggested that Tokyo too may be much more vulnerable than experts had thought. </P> <P> For this and other reasons, Tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. </P> <P> A study last year by Japan's National Land Agency concluded that if a great earthquake -- magnitude 8 or greater -- should strike Tokyo in the middle of the night it would kill about 80,000 people.He has concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. </P> <P> Most experts here had thought that Mexico City was an "exceptional case," Iemura said.And now, all these years later, Iemura and many other experts in Japan are afraid that history may repeat itself. </P> <P> "We are very afraid of fire," said Etsuzo Shima, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and one of Japan's leading earthquake experts.Okada directs a research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. </P> <P> Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations beneath Japan are constantly active. </P> <P> The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the planet.However, they can be quite large, well above magnitude 8, so they pose a great danger to areas on the surface. </P> <P> Furthermore, the strength of an earthquake here is magnified by the geological conditions that underlie nearly the entire city of Tokyo.Two of the plates sink beneath the islands of Japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the Earth directly below Tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. </P> <P> Most other earthquake-prone regions, including California, only have to worry about two colliding plates. </P> <P> The threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is being reclaimed from Tokyo Bay to serve the needs of millions more who are flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity.
