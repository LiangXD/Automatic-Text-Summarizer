"Every census since the Constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens," observed Rep."Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted" in the census, responded Ridge.The problem has been in deciding which states may count these people as residents.The battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both in committee and on the House floor.That has yet to be decided, but possibilities include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last state where he or she lived for at least six months.
