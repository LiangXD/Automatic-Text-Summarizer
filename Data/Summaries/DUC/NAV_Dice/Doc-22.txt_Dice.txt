"I think it's utter stupidity," Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said.It's a pain control technique," he said.Police actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said.At demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: "L.A. blue, we're with you."Sobel was "amused" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives."This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into doing what the federal government wants it to do," said Gates.But, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any nonviolent demonstrator is often "barbaric," and she supports restraints on the police."It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent," said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration.A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: "By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . .Meanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it.Suddenly, some pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion Republicans are voicing the sort of "police state" rhetoric once associated with anti-war radicals.A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting.Trying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.In reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used "in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . . all through the '60s, all through the '70s," Gates said.This time, however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes from anti-abortion protesters with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives.In fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta."The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground," Nichols said.In demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and Denver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of "curbside justice."In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along.Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police.But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and "go limp" when asked to move, others link arms.In introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting nonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado's conservative Republican senator, decried pain-compliance as "something we expect to hear about in Nicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America."Police departments nationwide say it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative protesters cooperate.* In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: "Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em."Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.But if this "horrendous" new measure has its intended effect, eliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, his department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe take over any facility they choose, he said.Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa.As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities."All I want my officers to think of at the time that they're taking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest.Operation Rescue protesters stand out, he said.If you don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are possible."Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights."In fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force.What they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights."* NEW USE FOR OLD TOOL An ancient Asian farm tool has become a cutting edge weapon for many police officers in Southern California.Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of synapses whether "reasonable force" included opening fire with her handgun.
