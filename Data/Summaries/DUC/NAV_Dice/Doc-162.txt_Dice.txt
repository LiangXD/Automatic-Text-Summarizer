"There (was) no oil (cleanup equipment) out there and it's been 14 hours since it happened.Floating Oil Booms Gonzales, the Coast Guard spokesman, said the terminal has cleanup equipment on site for minor spills.Leak a Mere Trickle A representative of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the tanker had been spilling oil at a rate of 10,000 barrels an hour but the Coast Guard said the leak had become a mere trickle by 2:30 p.m., Alaska time.Cowper said that conventional responses, such as booms, probably would not work because the spill is so large."We've had no report of any wildlife hurt at this time," he said.U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer John Gonzales said in a telephone interview from Valdez that the spill was staying "in the mid-channel" and did not seem to be moving toward the shore.Another Exxon tanker was attempting to pump the oil out of the crippled vessel, and two Coast Guard investigators were on board the Valdez, he said."It is huge, literally huge," he said in a telephone interview from Cordova."It's a gorgeous marine environment and ecosystem, with lots of little islands and inlets and bays," said Emily Barneet, Alaska issues specialist for the Sierra Club in Anchorage.Jon Nelson, a deputy regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage, said the reef ripped a 150-foot gash in the vessel, which was carrying 1.2 million barrels of oil, and there was fear that the tanker could break apart further.Exxon's Parish said everything possible was being done."We've been able to brag for a long time that there's never been a major oil spill in Valdez Harbor.Expected Worst "But this could be a catastrophic occurrence, so we're concerned," he said.The spill is expected to add fuel to a campaign by environmentalists to prevent further oil development in Alaska, particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.This is a major spill by any reckoning.
