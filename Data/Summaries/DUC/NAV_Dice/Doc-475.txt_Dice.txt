"Higher wages . . . for some will mean jobs lost for those workers who are trying hardest to break into the labor market," warns GOP Sen."That is exactly what raising the minimum wage will do."Opponents of raising the minimum wage insist that past increases have had a substantial effect in both layoffs and "disemployment" -- workers not hired who otherwise would have been.The advocates of a higher minimum wage say increases are necessary to offset lost ground.Opponents of boosting the wage floor argue that it is these jobs that are most at risk.Now the minimum amounts to only 34% of the average manufacturing wage.In return for administration agreement to raising the wage, Mr. Brock says, Congress must also allow a "youth differential" wage that's lower than the minimum wage, so as not to discourage employers from hiring untrained new job entrants."The minimum wage has no bearing on what we do -- it's a forgotten issue," he says.In 1968, the minimum wage was about 53% of the average hourly wage of a manufacturing employee.The labor federation notes that since World War II, employment actually increased each time the minimum wage was raised, except in the 1975 recession.He says the increase would affect the unemployment rate by less than one-tenth of a percentage point, and adds: "Estimates of dire consequences to the economy as a result of raising the minimum wage do not stand up to scrutiny."From 1981 through 1986, the minimum wage wasn't raised at all.Between 1978 and 1981, Congress raised the minimum wage four times.
