In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said.Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said.About 800 quakes between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.9 are recorded each year, said USGS spokesman Don Finley in Washington."There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said Person, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than 25 years.With a measured eye, he estimated the quake was magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 on the Richter scale.A quake of magnitude 2 is about the smallest felt by humans."This is just a normal day," said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center.
