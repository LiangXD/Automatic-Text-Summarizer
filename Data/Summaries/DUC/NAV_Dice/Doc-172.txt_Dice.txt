In Washington, consumer activist Ralph Nader said Exxon "should not be allowed to forget" the spill and that a boycott would send the oil giant a message."We are going to be done this summer," Yost said.However, he said the cleanup, to be paid for by the oil industry, could add $100 million to $500 million to Alaska's economy, which he said is more than the effect of the fishing industry."The general feeling is that we would expect that they would comply with the environmental laws," Lamoreaux said.But Bill Lamoreaux, the ranking state environmental officer at the spill, said the laws would not be relaxed.They're one big blob of oil," said Ray Bane, superintendent of Katmai National Park, about 275 miles southwest of Valdez.State and federal officials said the focus of the cleanup is moving southwest, following the drifting oil along the Alaska Peninsula through the Shelikof Strait east of Kodiak Island.Lamoreaux said, "When we talk about 'light oiling,' it doesn't mean it won't have a devastating effect on wildlife."Yost, the top federal official tracking the environmental disaster, said Exxon's plan was poorly drafted and lacking in specifics.Exxon's 60-page, two-part revised strategy to cleanse some 364 miles of Alaska's coastline of the oil spilled March 24 by the tanker Exxon Valdez was released Monday.
