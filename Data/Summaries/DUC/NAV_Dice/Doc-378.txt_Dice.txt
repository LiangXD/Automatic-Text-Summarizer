The union asked the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, which hires Japanese workers for the bases, to urge the U.S. to drop the polygraph requirement.An agency spokesman said it consented to the U.S. plan but expressed concern about the "human-rights standpoint" of polygraph tests.About 500 Japanese base workers are subject to the lie-detector test, the spokesman said.Since September 1987, the Navy has been requiring the polygraph test before it grants "limited-access authorization," to personnel, a U.S. military spokesman said.Japanese workers at U.S. Navy bases are protesting a policy that requires workers who deal with confidential matters to submit to lie-detector tests.
