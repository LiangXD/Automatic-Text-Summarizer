Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military.U.S. commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000.The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S. officials now say, was that they all would have required lifting economic sanctions against Iraq."We looked to the United States, we expected you to have the moral edge," says Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University."I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter what happens," says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written extensively about Iraq.But it has offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise of Saddam Hussein and the destruction of the Iraqi military, not just the liberation of Kuwait."So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success," said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces.Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense.President Bush's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait.The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster.There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages.U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over.The U.S. hopes its troops will drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly, leaving much of Iraq's offensive military equipment destroyed or abandoned in Kuwait.The attack was lightning quick, as allied forces punched through tall sand berms on the border and pushed forward into Iraq and Kuwait.Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for allied forces as it appears to have been so far.
