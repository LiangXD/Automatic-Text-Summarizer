A state Court of Appeal ruled Monday that cities and counties may require applicants for jobs as police officers to submit to polygraph tests about their character and background.According to attorneys in the case, at least half of the cities and counties in the state currently require applicants for public safety jobs to take polygraph tests."Given a police officer's unique status in society, compulsory polygraph testing of applicants for police officer positions is justified," Perley said.Richard L. Pinckard, a deputy city attorney representing San Diego and three other cities backing Vallejo in the case, said the ruling was especially important in view of state laws barring polygraph exams for officers already on the job.San Francisco attorney Duane W. Reno, who represented a former officer who challenged the tests, said an appeal to the state Supreme Court would be considered.Although 23 states, including California, have in some way restricted tests, 14 have specifically permitted law enforcement agencies to conduct them for applicants, the court said.In support of his suit, he cited the statutes that prohibit officers from being forced to submit to such tests against their will, along with language in the 1986 state high court decision suggesting cities would bear a heavy legal burden in justifying the tests for applicants for public safety jobs.The panel noted that the right to privacy was "not absolute" -- and said that a city's interest in ensuring its officers were of the highest integrity outweighed any harm suffered by an applicant who loses a job opportunity for refusing the test.
