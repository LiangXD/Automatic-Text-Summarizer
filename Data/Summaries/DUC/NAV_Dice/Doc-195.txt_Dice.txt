Both Barco and his party's presidential candidate, Cesar Gaviria, have linked Colombia's salvation to constitutional reform.One of the country's presidential candidates, Alvaro Gomez, said Friday that Barco should name a three-man council to run Colombia's security forces to avoid a military coup.Former president Alfonso Lopez said the assassinations of three candidates indicated that Colombia's armed forces must be reorganized.But the Medellin cartel denied involvement, and no government official has yet said who was responsible for Pizarro's assassination."Never has there been such a great and pathetic image of anarchy," said Gomez, a presidential candidate of the Conservative Party.Several politicians and analysts said an armed assassin could not have been aboard a jetliner without the complicity of government and airport security personnel.Less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia to the brink of political chaos.
