White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked what he thought of Powell as a vice presidential prospect, said, "Colin Powell is a great American and would be an outstanding candidate for any position.Fitzwater was asked jokingly whether he is interested.Before he went to the Pentagon, Carlucci had Powell's job, and Powell was his deputy.Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, responding to a reporter's query, nodded toward Powell and said with a grin, "He's my candidate."Powell is the only current White House aide being mentioned as even a remote possibility to be Bush's running mate, although former chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. has been reported under consideration.Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., who is himself a potential vice presidential candidate, is among those who have mentioned Powell as a possible Bush running mate.
