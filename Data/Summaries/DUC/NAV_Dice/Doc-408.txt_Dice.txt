But the overriding concern, the board said, is that foreign cruise ships are subject to rules that are less stringent and vigorously enforced than those imposed on U.S. flag vessels.Despite its strongly worded report, the NTSB knows it could be years before the safety standards for cruise ships are upgraded.But almost all cruise ships operating out of the continental U.S. sail under foreign flags, and the U.S. Coast Guard conducts only cursory inspections of foreign vessels.Ships operating from U.S. ports carried about five million passengers last year, and in anticipation of continued growth, 20 cruise ships are under construction around the world.At least 80 foreign cruise ships operate out of U.S. ports, mostly from southern Florida."If these companies are going to have their fleets based in the U.S. and carry primarily U.S. passengers, then they should meet U.S. standards," says one safety board staffer.The board said there have been at least nine fires on foreign-flag cruise ships in recent years, several of them serious.(Many cruise ships now carry fewer than 1,000 people.)But as the booming cruise-ship industry plans ever larger ships -- some on the drawing boards could carry well over 3,000 people -- the safety board's concerns are rising.Fire is considered the most deadly threat for cruise ships.In a voluminous report issued yesterday, the National Transportation Safety Board said these and other incidents carry a clear warning: Many foreign-flag cruise ships that sail from U.S. ports have serious safety problems and the potential for a catastrophic accident is significant.There are only three U.S. flag cruise ships and they operate in the Hawaiian Islands.
