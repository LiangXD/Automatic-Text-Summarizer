Mr. Gartner has now made it abundantly clear that his goal is the elimination of handguns from our society.Clearly, the issue at hand is not gun control but, rather, crime control.Is how these people killed themselves the real issue, or is why more important?The problem is not the instrument used to kill oneself or someone else.The NRA has not acted prudently and is alienating the support and respect of many legislators, police departments and its members.As evidenced by New York City and Washington, which have the nation's strictest gun-control laws and virtually ban the ownership of handguns by law-abiding citizens, Mr. Gartner's placebo doesn't work because it ignores the root causes of suicide and crime.
