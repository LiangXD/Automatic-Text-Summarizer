'Mr Patten is the governor and the representative of the Hong Kong British government,' says one senior Chinese official in Hong Kong.'At least one senior Chinese official has said to me he believes there is no change of restoring co-operation and trust unless and until we have a new governor,' says Mr Tsang.Mr Patten is adamant that he is not leaving Hong Kong until he has discharged his duty.'We are not suggesting any change to the curriculum,' says Mr Tsang Yok Sing, a leading Beijing adviser in Hong Kong who is himself a school headmaster.In Mrs Wu's view: 'There is no absolute guarantee for Hong Kong that the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration will be met.This decision is set to take Hong Kong into uncharted waters, and casts doubt over the continuity of the colony's legal system.There is similar wariness among Chinese officials about the possibility that Britain may lay down financial obligations which only have to be met after 1997.It is hard to see how Beijing's desire to maintain a tight grip on the levers of power can be meshed with the traditional independence and professionalism of Hong Kong's civil service.Mr Tsang, a member of the Chinese government committee planning for the handover, says the provisional legislature will have full powers to make laws for an expected term of nine to 12 months.Take school text books, which have recently emerged as an issue because some pro-Beijing figures in Hong Kong do not believe that the current texts used in schools are sufficiently 'patriotic'.The real issue is: how easy will it be (for China) to break?One Chinese banker says: 'Hong Kong will become less free; more like Singapore.Mr Tsang says of the final recommendations of the provisional legislature: 'I think it most likely that any substantial conclusion will be deferred until after next year's elections to see how things are.'Some concrete evidence of this new realism is the agreement Beijing reached last month with Britain on the funding for Hong Kong's HKDollars 160bn (Pounds 13bn) airport development.Mr Patten claims that by 1997 public spending in Hong Kong as a percentage of GDP will be lower than it was in 1982 - the year Britain began handover negotiations with China.
