Most shareholder cases are settled, and Mr. Greenfield says he has had only two jury trials in the past six years, while handling scores of suits."It's a very real possibility," said Mr. Greenfield, who has filed several cases against Mr. Milken.While the Unocal suit claims enormous damages to shareholders, a suit filed by Mr. Greenfield's firm in February may be even broader.Realistically, it's highly unlikely that the civil cases against Mr. Milken will ever go to trial.Steven Rosenfeld, an attorney for Mr. Milken, says there are "no plans whatsoever" for his client to seek bankruptcy-court protection.He says he believes that once one case "breaks through" to trial, Mr. Milken will have no choice but to start settling the rest of the cases.Nonetheless, the plaintiff's lawyers agree that winning a trial against Mr. Milken wouldn't be easy.Also pending are a multitude of civil cases lodged in the past three years against Mr. Boesky, Drexel, Mr. Milken and others that accuse the defendants of insider trading, stock manipulation and other securities law violations.Mr. Bromberg and others assert that Mr. Liman, Mr. Milken's principal lawyer, negotiated to make the plea agreement narrow enough so that little of what Mr. Milken admitted to can be used against him in the civil suits.Those charges could be exceedingly helpful to plainitffs lawyers building civil cases against him.A civil case is always easier to prove than a criminal case because the civil plaintiff doesn't have to prove his charges beyond a reasonable doubt.While some shareholder attorneys routinely file multimillion-dollar suits whenever a takeover is announced or the market drops, the suits against Mr. Milken seem to be much more likely to succeed than most."It can't be proven by a handful of witnesses and a handful of documents," says Mr. Greenfield.In each case, the former junk bond impresario will be viewed as a convicted felon. -- So much evidence against him has already been gathered by federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission, much of which will eventually become available to shareholder lawyers, that plaintiffs' attorneys will have to do relatively little sleuthing of their own. -- While Mr. Milken didn't plead guilty to any racketeering counts, recent court cases have made it increasingly easy to show a so-called pattern of racketeering in civil cases.Mr. Greenfield's firm filed the suit along with plaintiff lawyer William S. Lerach of the shareholder law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie and Lerach.
