"This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island," said a construction union official.Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.It's the first time we have air passing between the two tunnels," said Gordon Crighton, tunnel engineering manager.The first coupling of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.Management sources at TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the "Chunnel" - the Channel Tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when British workers sent the probe through to French colleagues.26, after the digging for much of the tunnel is finished.Tuesday's linkup in the service tunnel is described by the French as a "mouse ole" - a bore only two inches in diameter.The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting for its total length of 31 miles.The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.
