The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of publicly provided pensions.Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these.Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in borrowing to fund the welfare state.And the demands put on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private provision of pensions and healthcare.The biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support.In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.Increases in life expectancy have already increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions.The ageing of the population has also contributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions.Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the OECD between 1989 and 1992.While short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since the second world war.Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in government spending.But a new glue will be needed over the next 50 years if advanced economies are to pass beyond the welfare state.Moves are afoot in countries such as Germany and Italy to raise the pension age.The strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by relating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age.The maturing of the welfare state is also a significant factor in the doubling of health expenditure since 1960.In a global economy, no country can long afford to burden business with higher welfare costs than its neighbours.Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would be needed to pay for pensions alone - and that on the assumption that the pensions do not increase in real terms.In some countries, the increase has been relatively moderate - 20 per cent or less in countries such as France, Japan and Switzerland.
