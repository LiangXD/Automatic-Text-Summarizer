At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followed by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists said.There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS, but that is likely, Vermund said.He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic, probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the 1970s.Homeless people are at elevated risk of tuberculosis, Vermund said.
