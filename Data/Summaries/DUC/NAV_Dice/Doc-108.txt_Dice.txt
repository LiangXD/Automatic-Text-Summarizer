For the first five years after a fire, while surrounding vegetation is still relatively low, there will be a proliferation of wildflowers in the park, she says.Mr. Despain has set up or is planning several long-term research projects to study the effects of this year's fires.Shrubs and grasses cover what is left of the burnt undergrowth, although fire scars will be visible on some trees for years.Tourists will be back next year for this . . . and perhaps to see how nature is restoring the forest."Fires have been an integral force in the Yellowstone ecosystem for the past 10,000 years since the glaciers left," Mr. Varley says.The fire was so intense that a gray shadow on the forest floor is all that remains of a fallen log.Then the forest thins as it ages, trees fall, underbrush grows, and the forest is primed for a fire to start its life cycle over again.Seeds that have been dormant for decades beneath the soil appear to be triggered by the passing fire, he says, and will germinate next spring.Carol Shively, a park ranger-naturalist at Grant Village in Yellowstone, says, "Next spring is going to be a spectacular one for wildflowers."Hundreds of plant species proliferate after a fire until "canopy closure" is achieved in about 40 years.As Yellowstone National Park's research biologist, he has already begun to monitor the forest's rebirth from the worst fire on record.Three to five additional bird species are likely to migrate into Yellowstone next year, attracted to the new plants and insects thriving in the meadows.Mr. Despain says it is no coincidence that most burnt trees here were senior citizens, relatively speaking, and highly susceptible to fire.Aspen trees, whose paper-white bark and yellow leaves punctuate the evergreen forests this time of year, also thrive after a fire.A panel of academics and scientists is being assembled to study this year's fires and make recommendations on what changes might be in order.The mature forest "has the least biological diversity of any habitat in the park," Mr. Varley says."Ecologically, there's no down side to the fire," he adds, conceding that similar statements by park officials may have sounded cavalier when the fires were raging.The tiny seeds are slowly released from rock-hard pine cones only after the cones have been seared by the passing flames; indeed, they require a fire to propagate themselves.The profusion of pine seeds is just one of the rejuvenating forces at work in Yellowstone even as the fires, largely quenched this week by rain and snow, still smolder.These and the rest of the park's thermal features remain unscathed by the fires.In an average year, 2.5 million tourists visit the huge park, and a drop-off because of the fire damage could severely hurt business.Forests visited only by ground fires will rebound almost as quickly.Yellowstone's meadows rebound the fastest after a fire.Yellowstone's elk and bison herds, as well as moose, should benefit from the additional forage in the park next year.The last fire to rival this year's in intensity roared across much of Yellowstone in the early 1700s.Next year, the ground cover replacing the park's burnt stands of aging lodgepole pines should provide a 30-fold increase in plant species.Wyoming's U.S. senators, Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Alan K. Simpson, are mindful of the damage the fires caused the state's tourist industry this year, as well as the threat to gateway towns near the park.The burnt "snags," as charred tree trunks are called, creak in the wind above Mr. Despain and are all that remain of a forest section that sprouted after a fire swept through here about the time of the Civil War.There has yet to be a confirmed report of a large animal killed by the flames, although a few deaths are almost inevitable, park officials say.Only about 500 mature trees were on an acre of hillside here before the fire.
