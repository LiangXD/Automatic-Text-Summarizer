The researchers said the drug is easy to produce and thus is likely to be less expensive than other cancer treatments."There aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay away for as long as four years," says Lawrence Piro, chief of cancer research at Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation, La Jolla, Calif., where the drug was developed."It's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments."About 50% to 60% of patients -- most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the drug, some with complete remission, he said."It is without doubt the most effective treatment for hairy-cell leukemia, in terms of rapidity of response," adds Elihu H. Estey, a cancer researcher at the University of Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.Hoffmann-La Roche is the U.S. subsidiary of F.None of the patients have had a relapse; complete remission has lasted from seven to 46 months after treatment, according to the study.
