"Joan is one of a kind," said Jim Gross, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center.Joan became the 10th named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season when top winds passed 39 mph on Oct.11. Hurricane strength is 74 mph.Also, he said hurricanes are often sapped of strength in the far southern Caribbean due to trade winds that push colder deep-ocean water to the surface, said Gross.
