The point at issue in Senate debate on a new immigration bill was whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will reallocate House seats among states after the 1990 census.He said it is unfair to count illegal aliens in reapportionment.Simply put, the question was who should be counted as a person and who, if anybody, should not.Richard Shelby, D-Ala., proposed, and won, the immigration bill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the redistricting process.The Constitution itself says the apportionment of the House is to be determined on the basis of "the whole number of free persons," excluding Indians and counting every five slaves as three persons.Opponents of the Shelby amendment, led by Sen.Shelby's amendment says only that the secretary is to "make such adjustments in total population figures as may be necessary, using such methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and appropriate" to keep illegal aliens from being counted in congressional reapportionment.Opponents of the amendment said that showed the authors of both documents wanted everybody counted for purposes of apportionment.
