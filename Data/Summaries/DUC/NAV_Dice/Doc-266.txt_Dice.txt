Shining Path rebels have formed a new front to push their insurgency into Lima and other coastal urban areas, President Alan Garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded within blocks of the Government Palace.The president, who leaves office July 28, said the newly formed People's Defense Revolutionary Movement, is the "urban, metropolitan organ of the Shining Path."The raids also proved that the new urban front has been formed, Garcia said: "The people who were captured were essential to the new movement."The Maoist-inspired Shining Path operates in at least half of Peru, especially in the mountains and jungle, but has had little success in expanding to coastal cities.
