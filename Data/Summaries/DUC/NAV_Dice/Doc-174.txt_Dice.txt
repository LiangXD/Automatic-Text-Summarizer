There are hundreds of beaches all over the sound that are still oiled, and the oil is slowly bleeding out.They say observers flying over the sound still report 15 to 20 oil sheens bleeding off beaches daily.That leaves 50 percent to 75 percent of the oil in the water, on the ocean bottom or on beaches.Those numbers alone make the Valdez spill the most lethal ever, but scientists say the actual death count is much higher, estimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank from sight or drifted out to sea.From a helicopter, the wave-washed beach looks as if the worst oil spill in U.S. history had never touched it."Hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under this beach," he says.A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, the question clings like the oil under this Perry Island beach.But when Exxon suspended its $2 billion cleanup in mid-September, it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the oil spilled, state officials estimate.Exxon officials, meanwhile, say their winter monitoring of 64 sites shows wind and waves have scoured away, on average, more than half the surface oil left in September, and up to 80 percent of the buried oil.
