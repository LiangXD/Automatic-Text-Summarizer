Upsetting its delicate balance, they say, will have consequences no one can predict.Antarctica, the last place on Earth where nature reigns over man, is facing a showdown between those who want to tap its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched under ice.Antarctica is 98 percent under ice, but it is no more a white continent than Africa is a dark one.France, echoing Australia's concerns, wants Antarctica to be an unspoiled world park.Although 16 nations fly flags in Antarctica, and seven claim slices of it, no one holds title.For 10 years, scientists there have measured the Earth's thinning ozone layer, letting through radiation that risks catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels.As the sun shifts its angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond, Antarctica is aglow in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas.Specialists regard Antarctica as the world's weather factory.The majestic continent at the bottom of the world, larger than United States and Mexico combined, is still peopled by scant thousands who have to import everything but ice cubes.
