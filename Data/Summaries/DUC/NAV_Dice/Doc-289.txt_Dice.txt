The public, and even public officials, remain largely unaware that Japan's scientists are debating whether prediction is impossible or merely difficult.Japan's prediction research activities, primarily overseen by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, are subject to no such review.The evidence is that significant strain has accumulated along the fault since the region's last big earthquake.In Japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the Tokai area was overdue for a significant quake.Japan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists throughout the world were optimistic about prediction.Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.6m) a year monitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research.The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock in the hope that six experts, to be summoned at a moment's notice, will recognise unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake.Despite the protests, however, Japan's earthquake prediction programme rolls along on inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations.If the committee so advises, Japan's prime minister will issue an earthquake warning for the Tokai area.Aside from the Tokai effort, scientists outside the programme are disturbed that it is so generously funded and has so little to show.
