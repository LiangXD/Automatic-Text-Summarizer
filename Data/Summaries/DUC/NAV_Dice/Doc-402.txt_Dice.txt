The solemn ceremony, held across the street from the White House, also brought together the families of the seven other Americans who were kidnaped after Anderson and are still held in Lebanon.In Paris, former hostages Jean-Paul Kauffman and Roger Auque put on blindfolds and chained themselves to a tree outside the Iranian Embassy to protest Anderson's captivity.She also said she had "faith" that all the hostages would be released "in the coming weeks."Kauffman and Auque were silent during their protest but said in a statement: "We have taken this action so people know how Terry Anderson is living at this moment.Opponents of the Iranian regime said they see no reason to believe that a hostage release is imminent.Say, who in the past has criticized U.S. officials over the lack of progress on the hostage issue, said she was reassured that Bush is doing all he can.The two were among 10 French hostages released by their captors in Lebanon between 1986 and 1988.But noticeably absent was any evidence that the hostages would be released soon.Bush told reporters: "I'm going to do everything I can to get those hostages out of there, sometimes privately, sometimes publicly."The Lafayette Park ceremony was sponsored by "No Greater Love," a Washington-based support group for the families of the hostages.In a letter published by seven Beirut newspapers, Anderson's wife, Madeline Bassil, told her husband that she and their daughter also feel like hostages.The Iranian news media have begun referring to the hostages again as American "spies."The families of the hostages have received little news of their condition other than an occasional -- and often distressing -- photo.Family, friends and colleagues of Associated Press correspondent Terry A. Anderson gathered at Lafayette Park on Friday to mark an anniversary they had hoped to never see.This is how we were.
