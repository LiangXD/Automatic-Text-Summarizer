One banker who will be glad of the new restrictions is Peter Persaud, who says he was denied a job as a vice president of Amerifirst Bank in Miami after twice flunking polygraph tests early this year.Because of the new law, employers who have relied heavily on lie detectors will have to resort to such alternatives as written tests that are designed to gauge a person's honesty, and background checks of job applicants -- something that critics of polygraphs say they should have been doing in the first place.Other employees, too, cite problems arising from polygraph tests."I think the polygraph test is designed to make an honest person seem dishonest because of the way it is administered," Mr. Persaud says.While polygraph specialists say the devices can achieve 90% accuracy, critics contend that the accuracy rate can be as low as 25% and that a tough-minded liar can often control himself well enough to pass the test.A bill signed into law Monday by President Reagan will sharply restrict employers' use of polygraph tests.Zale's policy, a spokeswoman explains, is to do "very selective" polygraph testing during an investigation of suspected theft or loss.Widespread polygraph testing of bank workers and executives will also be curtailed.Critics of polygraph testing, who claim it's both unreliable and subject to potential abuse, are welcoming the restrictions.Mr. Kaufman asserts that even the use of lie-detector tests when there has been a theft, which will still be permitted under the new law, will end because employers will have to do such things as give an employee a written statement to the effect that he is "reasonably" suspected of stealing.Testifying before Congress in support of the bill, he alleged that the examiners pressured him into writing down any gossip he had heard about the conduct of other Zale workers -- including drug use -- by telling him he would flunk the test and be fired if he didn't comply.Some critics of polygraph testing say a major problem with lie detectors is that a conscientious but easily upset truth teller could show the quickened pulse, faster breathing, increased blood pressure and skin reactions that a polygraph typically measures.Managers and other white-collar workers in the securities industry have been subject to polygraph tests where circumstances warrant, the trade group says, adding that the decision to test hinges on the employee's "access to negotiable instruments, currency or securities -- not on the employee's rank."Mr. Darby says he took the test for fear he would be dismissed if he didn't.
