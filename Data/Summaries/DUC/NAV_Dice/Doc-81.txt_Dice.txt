Seven of the eight TB cases occurred in people who were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before the study began.In the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the TB usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis infections, not new exposures to the bacteria, in people who also are infected with the AIDS virus.People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria for many years without getting sick.
