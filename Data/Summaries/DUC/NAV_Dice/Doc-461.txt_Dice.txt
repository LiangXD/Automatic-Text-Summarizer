Just as he said in his article, the reason is that what he has done since he became governor of Hong Kong has been criticized and condemned not only by China and people of Hong Kong, but also by people in Britain.This British Hong Kong governor is really more concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people.People will also ask: Why will the position of Britain in China and Asia be decided by how Britain discharges its responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner?To the Chinese people, the following is understandable: Hong Kong was plundered after the Opium War, a war of aggression launched by Britain against China.People cannot but ask: Why is Hong Kong the biggest and most important part of Sino-British relations?If Britain ensures a smooth return of Hong Kong to China in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, is it not a practice in a "dignified manner?"Then what did he mean by saying Hong Kong is the "biggest and most important" part of Sino-British relations?
