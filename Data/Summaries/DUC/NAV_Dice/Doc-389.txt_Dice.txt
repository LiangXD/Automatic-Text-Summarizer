USS Vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as American officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai.It is necessary to note that the area where the plane was attacked is well outside the declared war zones of the combatants.Finally, the most awkward American explanation for shooting down a civilian airliner was presented by Adm.While every available evidence including the transcripts read earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any warning, many have contended that in such a short and routine flight, the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency civilian frequency.The question that needs to be asked is why a warship had positioned itself right at the center of a civilian airway.
