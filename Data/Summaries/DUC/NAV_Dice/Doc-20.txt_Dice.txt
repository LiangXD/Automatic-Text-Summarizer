Dickey has been temporarily reassigned to a desk job, and Jackson was charged with interfering with a police officer.Boatwright questioned whether the car in which Jackson was riding was actually weaving -- the stated cause for the traffic stop -- and whether Jackson acted aggressively toward the officers, as Dickey said in his report.Dickey acknowledged that the police car he was driving "was weaving all over, too" as it tailed Jackson's car.Dickey's eight-page police report, which was provided to reporters, states that Jackson was arrested for saying "offensive words," an allegation that was later dropped.At one point in the proceeding, Boatwright had Dickey and Jackson weighed in an attempt to show that Jackson is shorter and weighs less than the officer.But Dickey conceded at the hearing that it was he, not Jackson, who uttered obscenities.The officer said Jackson's face crashed through the window when Jackson suddenly pulled forward.Dickey, who was testifying under subpoena, admitted under questioning that the black man, Don Jackson, never used profanity during the arrest as Dickey had indicated in his report."There can be a fight without a verbal challenge," Dickey said, adding that Jackson's fists were clenched at his sides.Dickey said that he was swearing to try to alleviate his fear.Boatwright contended that in using that type of hold the officer would have had to push Jackson into the window deliberately.At another point, Boatwright assumed the role of Dickey and had Dickey play Jackson in trying to demonstrate the type of hold Dickey used on Jackson during the arrest.Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave and a self-styled crusader against police brutality, had gone to Long Beach that night with an NBC television crew following in a separate vehicle in what he termed a "sting" operation to validate reports of racism and brutality by Long Beach police officers.Jackson, according to Dickey, struck the window with his elbows and not with his face as Jackson contends.
