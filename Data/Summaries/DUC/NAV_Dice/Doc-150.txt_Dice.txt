"He is trying to say that everyone was on it, so they got on it," Lewis said."If it has been proven that he took drugs, I would think that (withdrawing the record) is the responsible thing for the sport," Lewis said Sunday."I said, 'Look, I don't know what he is taking or what he is doing, but he is doing something.'"That's what people don't realize," he said."No way in the world does she take drugs," Lewis said, pounding a table.Carl Lewis said he knew Ben Johnson was taking performance-enhancing drugs just after their 100-meter final last fall at the Seoul Olympics.Lewis said track and field is not infested with steroid users as some are beginning to believe in light of the Canadian inquiry.Don't take it unless you know what it is.'"Most of your great athletes are clean," Lewis said.Lewis, who won four gold medals at the 1984 Summer Games and has been one of the great sprinters and long jumpers in track and field, said he is determined to help the sport's image."I think Ben is 110% irresponsible in not coming out and telling kids to stay off drugs," he said.Lewis had finished second to Johnson, who set a world record of 9.79 seconds in winning the 100-meter gold medal, and subsequently also had to be tested.According to Francis' testimony, Johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples.Lewis said their philosophy was inspired by the late Dr. Martin Luther King, who once said it is important to make such sacrifices.That's why they got on drugs."Even before Lewis replaced Johnson as the gold-medal winner two days after the race, the U.S. Olympian said he was happy with his result.IAAF officials, however, said the record will stand because Johnson passed a drug test after the 1987 race."That people cannot sacrifice for something in their life, whether it is a small insignificant thing to others or a big thing to the world, what's the use of living?"If that were to happen, Lewis would replace Johnson as the world record-holder.Now Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of Johnson's drug test, which returned a positive result for the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol.
