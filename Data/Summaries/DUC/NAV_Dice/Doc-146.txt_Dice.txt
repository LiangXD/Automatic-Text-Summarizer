There is "almost a 100 percent guarantee" that increased income for women will go into improvements in their children's welfare, Hatch says.Their vehicle for improvement is the village bank, each comprised of 30 to 50 women who, through loans starting at $50, can earn enough to provide savings and create capital.Overall, the average is 97 percent, says Hatch.Hatch says he believes village banking has a role to play in reducing poverty along the Mexican border and in slowing down migration to this country.What Hatch envisioned on that plane five years ago has translated into 400 village banks in nine countries with more than 35,000 members.Interest in village banking is mounting."Fifty percent or more are illiterate, and I would say 90 percent of them don't have any idea of what they're getting into when we start out," says Hatch.What he had stumbled upon was village banking, a system of investment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance their private enterprise, allowing them to create savings while paying interest and qualifying for bigger loans."Ultimately the way out of poverty is savings," Hatch adds."Forget the mayor, forget the priest, forget the chief," Hatch says.
