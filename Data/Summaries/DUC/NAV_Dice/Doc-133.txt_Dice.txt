The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners."I didn't really want to lead all the way," Wilson said.Gural emphatically said it was too hot, "The sun went to work," was how he put it, and he said he experienced tenderness in his liver during the race.Asked if she was ever aware of Yanmin during the race, Konatz laughed.Run as a race within a race was the Pacific Rim Marathon, which consists of teams from invited countries.Two Soviet runners -- Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva -- who had run side-by-side in third and fourth place throughout the race, faded.Wilson and Yanmin won both the Long Beach Marathon and the Pacific Rim race, for total prize money of $9,500 each.Patience was its own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday, as the men's and women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take a toll on the runners."I hate the marathon," Wilson, 28, said, sounding quite sensible.Conditions were excellent at the start of the race, which had its largest-ever field of 4,021 entrants.So did Ngaire Drake of New Zealand, who was third in 2:44:09.It fell to Konatz, who had been in first and second throughout the race, to hang in there."The marathon is an unpredictable event," she said.
