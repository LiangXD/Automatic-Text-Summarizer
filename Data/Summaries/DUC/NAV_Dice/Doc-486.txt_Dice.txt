Plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands in Biosphere II.In all, some 3,800 species of plant and animal life are being invited to the party, and as in the original Eden, snakes.Scientists had to be sure there would be that many in bloom every day of the year.The oxygen is breathed in by humans and animals who breathe out carbon dioxide which is breathed in by the plants and used in photosynthesis which produces more oxygen.Nevertheless it will be the same air and water year-round.It is the professional nature of engineers and architects to keep the outside world out.So Dr. Tony Burgess of the University of Arizona patterned the deserts after those of Baja California where the cactus and other plants have learned to live with ocean fog.Now suddenly they had to devise ways to keep the wild world in.Biosphere II is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural proclivity of water.The water-laden air then is drawn and climbs the mountain where natural cooling and condensing coils bring it down as rain and dew to feed the stream again.Probably the first to consider Earth and its environment as a biosphere was a Soviet scientist, V.I. Vernadsky in 1926.
