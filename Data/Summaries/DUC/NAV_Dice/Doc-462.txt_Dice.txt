In an interview with the media on the last day of his stay in Australia, he went so far as to say that Chinese officials do not understand the international status and importance of Hong Kong so their criticism of him does not conform to reality, adding that Hong Kong is an "international asset" as well as China's asset.How can Patten be compared with the Chinese Government where the understanding of Hong Kong's international status and its importance are concerned.Nevertheless, it is internationally accepted that while the Hong Kong issue is a matter for both China and Britain before 1997, it is purely a Chinese internal affair after 1997.Patten's allegation that the Chinese side does not understand Hong Kong's "international status" is entirely nonsense.What merits attention is that this was not the first time Patten has referred to Hong Kong as an "international asset."In saying Hong Kong is an international asset, Patten intentionally evaded the problem of to whom Hong Kong belongs.Hong Kong is ranked among the biggest international cities and has become one of the international economic, trade, financial, and shipping centers but this will never change the fact that it is part of Chinese territory.Though Britain has ruled over Hong Kong for one and a half centuries, the fact that Hong Kong is China's sacred territory will never change.How can China's sovereignty over Hong Kong be evaded!What Patten has said and done since he arrived in Hong Kong, including the "international card," has been designed to meticulously carry through the third step laid down by the British Government.During his recent trip to Australia, apart from saying that Hong Kong was an "international asset," he claimed that for various countries to support Hong Kong in expanding democracy is not equivalent to interfering in China's internal affairs.
