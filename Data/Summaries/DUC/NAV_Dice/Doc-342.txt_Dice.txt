Critics say the environmental provisions will make science more expensive in Antarctica, already the costliest research site apart from outer space.In the U.S., Antarctic budgets have been rising steadily, mostly to pay for logistics.Argentina and Chile claim parts of Antarctica as extensions of their countries, even though the Antarctic Treaty effectively makes the continent international territory."We've been living on a tripod-geopolitics, future uses of Antarctica and research," says Guy Guthridge, an NSF Antarctic spokesman.Of the $193 million the U.S. plans to spend this fiscal year in Antarctica, only $22 million is budgeted for science.Instead, in October, the Antarctic treaty nations approved a substitute that bars mineral and oil exploration for at least 50 years and requires environmental safeguards for research bases.
