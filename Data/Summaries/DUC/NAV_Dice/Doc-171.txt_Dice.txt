Exxon officials Monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of Alaskan coastline fouled by the nation's largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a suspension of local environmental laws.We have one verified sighting of a bear walking through the oil," Bane said.Exxon is feeling the effects of the spill far beyond Alaska waters.The oil has had an impact on virtually the entire coastline of the park," Bane said.Before the plan was released, Yost said he wanted much more detail than Exxon's original cleanup plan, which included nothing on polluted areas outside the sound.Exxon also received sharp criticism from the federal government, which accused the company of "foot-dragging" in the construction of a second facility in Seward to aid in the cleanup of sea otters fouled by the oil.
