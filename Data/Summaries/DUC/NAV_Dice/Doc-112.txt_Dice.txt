Another spokewoman for the actress, Lisa Del Favaro, said Miss Taylor's family was at her bedside.The 58-year-old actress, who won best-actress Oscars for "Butterfield 8" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," has been hospitalized more than two weeks.While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator, it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G. Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert who emphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition.A seriously ill Elizabeth Taylor battled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by a ventilator, doctors say.
