Declined to Speculate Milken said he isn't currently talking with any of his former colleagues at Drexel about coming to work for his new firm, but he didn't rule out that possibility.For the time being, Milken's legal problems probably will prevent him from competing directly with Drexel, individuals involved in the legal cases said."I can't predict what's going to happen in the future," he said.Michael Milken is said to be owed at least $200 million.Friends of Milken's have speculated that one reason he decided to start a new firm now is that, since taking a leave of absence from Drexel, he has had an unaccustomed amount of time on his hands.Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, said: "Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad event."During the rare, on-the-record interview, Michael Milken said of the resignation: "After spending your whole life working for one company, it's a very emotional experience."A source close to Milken said: "I think you'd have to take it on a case-by-case basis."Lowell Milken had been a lawyer with the Los Angeles firm of Irell &amp; Manella before he left in 1978 to help his brother run Drexel's junk bond department.Charges Denied Harmon is said to have detailed knowledge of some of Milken's business dealings with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky.The Milken brothers still face SEC civil charges as well as the separate criminal charges.A number of Milken's former colleagues at Drexel already have been granted immunity from prosecution and are cooperating with the government investigation.The SEC settlement's ban on Drexel doing business either directly or indirectly with Milken could be interpreted to mean that Drexel can't do business with clients advised by Milken.Michael Armstrong, Lowell Milken's lawyer, said his client hasn't decided yet where he will practice."I think Michael is desperate to find something to do," a former Drexel colleague said."Drexel is the only company I've worked for since graduating from college.Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, 39, also resigned Thursday from Drexel.Lowell Milken was also indicted in March on racketeering charges."I have more demands on my time than ever before," he said, although he added, referring to the legal cases: "Sometimes they're things you'd rather not have to spend time on."Milken said he decided to set up his own firm now because "to continue to help (people he has done business with or offered advice to), I need some vehicle to be able to help.""Junk bond" wizard Michael Milken officially ended his 20-year career at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on Thursday and said he will launch his own financial consulting firm while he awaits trial on racketeering and securities fraud charges.
