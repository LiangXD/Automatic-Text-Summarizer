"We've decided to be our own country," says Mr. Veselinovic, "but we really don't know how we will execute it."Their identity is being turned upside down; once known as Yugoslavia's "developed north," Slovenia will now be lumped together with Western Europe's "underdeveloped south."But as Slovenes measure themselves with Western Europe, it is they who are the poorer cousins.Their considerable trade with the rest of Yugoslavia, which helped make them the country's richest people, is vanishing.Finding new markets in the West is all the more urgent with the certain decline in Slovenia's trade with the rest of Yugoslavia.At the stock exchange, Mr. Veselinovic frets that his post-independence plans to trade in gold, commodities and foreign currencies are jeopardized by the uncertainty engulfing Slovenia.Almost every country on the continent has its own disenchanted minorities, from the Soviet Baltics to French Corsica, that could be encouraged by the independence declarations of Slovenia and the neighboring republic of Croatia.Joze Mencinger, an economist and former finance minister of Slovenia, illustrates the republic's economic resilience by noting that while Yugoslavia's industrial output fell 18% so far this year, Slovenia's declined only 10%.But there is also a growing unease about going forward, because no one knows where Slovenia is headed.But what Slovenes dream of is one day being admitted to the EC.
