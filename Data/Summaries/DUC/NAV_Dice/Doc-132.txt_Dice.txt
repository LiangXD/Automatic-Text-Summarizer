"I was concentrating on running five-minute miles," he said.At 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and not appearing to labor under the bright sun."I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went," Davies-Hale said.In the women's race, Weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with that handicapping.It was the slowest winning time in this race since 1982.It was the same spot, the corner of Wells and North Avenue, that Weidenbach had taken the lead in last year's race."To be honest with you, I was afraid of Cathy (O'Brien)," she said.Davies-Hale may have shown a liking for running in heat when he won the Boulder Bolder that year in terrific heat.Given the heat, the humidity and the wind, Weidenbach's time might have been as much as two minutes faster.Following him, and likewise picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the Soviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British Midlands, who was third in 2:13:37.Among the men, Paul Davies-Hale of England proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever.By comparison, last year's race was 30 degrees cooler at the start.It was the second-hottest race in Chicago history, only 1978 was worse.O'Brien was third in 2:31:19.Race director Tim Murphy said the race was not selected by The Athletics Congress, which governs the sport, to conduct testing. . . .Still, Davies-Hale is unsure what his future in the marathon is.Ann Cody Morris won the women's wheelchair race in 1:58:51.
