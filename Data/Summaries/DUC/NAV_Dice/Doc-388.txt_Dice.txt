"From what I've heard about the ship, it's like everybody on it is family and they're trying to be the best in the Navy," Toth said.The USS Vincennes' destruction of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake organization said Sunday.It was the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of Vincennes."On the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the captain acted the best way he knew how," said William E. Brooks Jr., publisher of the Vincennes Sun-Commercial newspaper and a member of the USS Vincennes Association."There's no way of rectifying this kind of situation, so all we can do is remember these people," Toth said.
