A top West German military official said Saturday that the fiery crash of a U.S. Air Force jet that killed six people will further erode popular support for national defense programs. Later Saturday, at least 4,000 people took part in a torchlight vigil and procession in downtown Remscheid to remember the victims and to demand an end to low-level flight training missions. A U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II jet tore a swath of destruction through a working-class neighborhood in the central West German city of Remscheid. In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, the inspector general of West Germany's military said the crash was certain to have a serious impact on already sinking public support for defense issues. Wellershoff was referring to recent polls indicating dwindling public support for defense spending and increasing dissatisfaction over disruptive and often deadly military training maneuvers. Even before Thursday's fatal crash, 12 major accidents of military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone. The U.S. Air Force said in a statement Saturday that the pilot of the A-10 "inadvertently flew into clouds" while attempting to join in close formation with another aircraft. The statement said the lead aircraft climbed above the clouds, but that the second A-10 "continued in a descent."
