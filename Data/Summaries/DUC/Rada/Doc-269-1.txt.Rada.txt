Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) -- The Sunday Review television program said that according to a very reliable source, the end of the popular war, the surrender of weapons, and a general amnesty, would be the main points of a peace agreement without victors or vanquished, between the Shining Path and the Peruvian Government. Together with the improvement of relations between both parties, it is also stressed that the agreement would be without conquerors or vanquished, and would ease the way for the return of those Shining Path members living abroad in order to recover the country's social and normal life. So far, government authorities have not denied or rejected the accuracy of this agreement between the government and Shining Path.
