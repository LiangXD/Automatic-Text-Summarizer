just try explaining what GATT, the Uruguay Round or Blair House are all about - but US investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the North American Free Trade Agreement: if Congress passes the treaty next week, it will be good for the economy, good for US companies, good for the stock markets, and good for President Clinton. Investors fear that a rejection of Nafta would have dangerous knock- on effects around the world, depressing share prices in the US, Latin America and eventually Europe, and endangering vital trade negotiations over the Uruguay Round. By coincidence, the day after next week's Nafta vote, Clinton will be in Seattle for a trade conference with leaders of Asian Pacific Nations. If he arrives there fresh from defeat on Nafta, the President's authority on trade issues will be compromised. Investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on Nafta would throw such a spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic growth. Thus, any reversal in that trend - a return of trade barriers, higher inflation, higher bond yields, - could undermine equity markets that are already vulnerable to a sharp downward correction because of expensive stock valuations. Although the President inherited the trade pact from his Republican predecessor, he has invested a lot of his own political capital in getting Nafta through Congress. Stock markets in Mexico and the US, however, believe the chances of success for Nafta improved this week. Nafta is playing on investors' minds because doubts over its passage through Congress have arisen at a vulnerable time for stock and bond prices. Amid all the doubts over the Nafta, one thing is certain, trading on markets next week is likely to be hamstrung by uncertainty over Wednesday night's vote, which, like the battle over President Clinton's first budget, will be extremely close.
