Shining Path rebels have formed a new front to push their insurgency into Lima and other coastal urban areas, President Alan Garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded within blocks of the Government Palace. The president, who leaves office July 28, said the newly formed People's Defense Revolutionary Movement, is the "urban, metropolitan organ of the Shining Path." The Maoist-inspired Shining Path operates in at least half of Peru, especially in the mountains and jungle, but has had little success in expanding to coastal cities. In one of the guerrilla safehouses raided in an upper-class Lima suburb, police found tons of Shining Path documents and propaganda. They also found personal possessions that apparently belonged to Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman. Two people were injured in the car bombings near the Government Palace on Tuesday night and Wednesday and Garcia called the upsurge in urban violence a "desperate response" to the weekend raids. In other violence Wednesday in Lima, a city of 6 million, four rebels armed with machine guns took over a neighborhood electoral office. Guerrillas blew up at least three high-tension power pylons Tuesday night, blacking out parts of the capital and other coastal cities where most of Peru's 22 million people live.
