The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The European Commission planned to tell Germany that it would take legal action if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban, commission officials said yesterday. Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UK after the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK. British officials say that the EU single market will be disrupted unless all member states stick to the scientific evidence, and that Germany's threat of unilateral action risks a collapse in beef consumption similar to the fall that followed the 1990 BSE scare.
