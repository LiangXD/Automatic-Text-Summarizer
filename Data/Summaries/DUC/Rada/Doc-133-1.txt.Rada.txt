Patience was its own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday, as the men's and women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take a toll on the runners. Rex Wilson of New Zealand patiently waited for the lead pack to sort itself out, took the lead at 10 miles and rolled to a victory in 2 hours 12 minutes 27 seconds, a course record. Wilson and Yanmin won both the Long Beach Marathon and the Pacific Rim race, for total prize money of $9,500 each. The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners. Gural emphatically said it was too hot, The sun went to work, was how he put it, and he said he experienced tenderness in his liver during the race. Samson Obwocha, a Kenyan who lives in Gardena, waited for Gural to fade and then made his move. Wilson also made a move, or more precisely, he continued his steady 5:03 mile pace while the rest of the field slowed from the early, faster pace. I hate the marathon, Wilson, 28, said, sounding quite sensible. Yanmin had to come from behind for her victory, giving the women's race an exciting finish. As happened in the men's race, the runners in the lead pack ebbed and eventually faded. Guadalupe Roman of Mexico led through much of the race but lost ground steadily in the last five miles and finished sixth. Two Soviet runners -- Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva -- who had run side-by-side in third and fourth place throughout the race, faded. It fell to Konatz, who had been in first and second throughout the race, to hang in there. Asked if she was ever aware of Yanmin during the race, Konatz laughed. I knew at 25 miles if someone had a good kick....
