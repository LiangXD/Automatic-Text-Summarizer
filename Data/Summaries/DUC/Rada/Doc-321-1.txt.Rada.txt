A federal judge sentenced an apparently stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in prison Wednesday after ruling that the crimes he pleaded guilty to were neither minor nor isolated. U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said the unexpectedly long prison term is meant to make an example of the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king, whose innovative use of high-yield, high-risk bonds had fueled the corporate takeover frenzy of the 1980s. Milken had pleaded guilty to six felony securities law violations last April. The judge said she based the sentence only on evidence of specific crimes presented in court. The judge left open the possibility of reducing the sentence if Milken cooperates with the government. A Milken spokesman said that no decision had been made on whether to appeal the sentence. Wood also sentenced him to three years of community service while on probation after his prison sentence. Wood said evidence presented during a pre-sentencing hearing in October convinced her that Milken had committed additional serious crimes beyond the six felony counts he pleaded guilty to in April. The judge also rejected longstanding defense claims that Milken's crimes were aberrations by a generally law-abiding man and that they were the result of overzealousness to help clients rather than greed. At Liman's request, the judge agreed to sentence Milken under a provision of federal law that allows him to be paroled at any time at the discretion of the federal parole commission. Although Milken technically could be paroled almost immediately, government lawyers said the commission normally requires prisoners to serve close to two-thirds of their sentence. In Milken's case, that would be about six years. The sentence exceeds all others imposed in the series of securities fraud cases that grew out of the insider trading case against investment banker Dennis B. Levine in 1986. The judge said she would consider reducing the sentence if prosecutors eventually certify to her that Milken has cooperated fully. Several lawyers said they interpreted the long sentence as an attempt by the judge to ensure that Milken cooperates fully, revealing whatever incriminating information he knows about corporate raiders, junk bond buyers and former co-workers. Charles Carberry, a lawyer who once headed the U.S. attorney's securities fraud unit in New York, said: I think it was a clear message that he should cooperate. John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor, said the judge may also have imposed the severe sentence because Milken occupied a position of trust at the center of the financial world. The six counts that Milken pleaded guilty to included conspiracy, securities fraud, causing the filing of false information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, mail fraud and aiding in the filing of a false tax return. The sentencing capped the most massive securities fraud investigation ever carried out by the government. But as investigators closed in, Milken was forced to resign from Drexel in 1989, after he was named in a 99-count racketeering indictment and the firm itself pleaded guilty to six felony counts. Liman also argued that Milken is just not cut from the same cloth as Ivan Boesky. Under federal court rulings, Wood is allowed to consider evidence of other crimes in deciding on a sentence. She said the government also did not prove its claim that Milken was guilty of insider trading in Caesars World securities in 1983, and also failed to show that he had illegally made lucrative investment opportunities available to employees of investment funds as inducements to get them to buy riskier securities for their funds. During the sentencing, Wood derided defense claims that Milken was basically law-abiding and that if he were not, he would have committed more blatant crimes, such as insider trading. Wood's sentence was viewed as a rebuff to many prominent Southern Californians who had written to her urging that Milken's sentence be limited to community service. James Slade, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons, said that under Justice Department rules, the 10-year term makes it unlikely that Milken will be allowed to serve his sentence in a minimum-security federal prison camp.
