A five-man U.N. team arrived in the Iranian capital of Tehran today to investigate the downing an Iranian jetliner by a U.S. warship. The International Civil Aviation Organization team planned to start its probe at Tehran international airport, where part of Iran's air traffic control network is based, said Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. The ICAO experts also will go to the area where the plane crashed into the sea near the Iranian island of Hengham in the Strait of Hormuz, the Iranian agency said in a dispatch monitored in Cyprus. The team is in Iran at the request of the Iranian government to help resolve discrepancies in accounts given by the two sides. The U.S. team left the gulf Thursday after spending 3{ weeks in the region, Navy officials said. Investigators compiled data from computer tapes on the Vincennes and two other U.S. warships that were in the area, the frigate USS Elmer Montgomery and missile frigate John H. Sides. Iran asked the 33-nation governing council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to meet in special session to condemn the attack, but members refused to censure the United States.
