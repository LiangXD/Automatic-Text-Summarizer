1. Gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annual hurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his first formal 1988 forecast in late May. "It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season," Gray said in a paper presented to the conference. But Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around the equator and winds for "El Nino" periods, when eastern Pacific waters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of when or where a hurricane might form. Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually occurred. In 1984, when there were five hurricanes, Gray had predicted seven.
