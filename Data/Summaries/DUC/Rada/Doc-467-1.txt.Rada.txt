The death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among non-smokers, according to a study published Friday. While no direct link has been established between smoking and leukemia, research published in the British Medical Journal showed that the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10 cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among non-smokers. "If the findings in our study represented a direct relationship between smoking and leukemia, then it must follow that smoking is responsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hitherto established causes combined," said Dr. Leo Kinlen, director of the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Edinburgh. The study found that in some types of leukemia, the death rate among smokers was sharply higher than the average. Thus for monocytic and myeloid leukemias, the rate among smokers of more than 20 cigarettes a day was 93 percent higher, compared with 48 percent for lymphatic leukemias. For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death from lymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher, and for one to 10 cigarettes, 40 percent higher.
