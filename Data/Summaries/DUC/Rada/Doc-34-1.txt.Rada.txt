Thousands of peole prayed, cheered, danced, beat drums and observed other traditions today as a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of Indonesia and the southern Philippines. A partial eclipse was visible across a wide area of Asia as far west as India _ including Southeast Asia, China, Japan and New Guinea as well as parts of Australia and the Pacific islands. Clouds obscured the solar spectacular in Jakarta, Indonesia, Hong Kong and in the eastern Mindanao city of Davao, where thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe the eclipse. He said thousands of Indonesians prayed and beat drums to herald the start of the eclipse, which began in southwestern Sumatra before heading on to the Philippines. Clouds blocked the first moments of the eclipse in General Santos City. In Baguio City, 130 miles north of Manila, pregnant women of the local Ilocano community rinsed their hair during the eclipse with water dripped from burned rice straws in a traditional ritual. Officials said about 20,000 tourists and scientists from around the world had come to the southern Philippines to watch the eclipse, the last one expected here for at least 50 years. Scientists said the area afforded the best opportunity to witness and study the eclipse because skies are usually clear this time of year. In Manila, thousands turned out under clear skies to see the partial eclipse that blocked about 75 percent of the sun's surface at its height. Solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the Earth and the sun.
