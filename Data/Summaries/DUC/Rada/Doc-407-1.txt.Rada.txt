Stores and offices closed, apparently out of fear of attacks, when what was intended to be a blockade of transport turned into a general strike. Groups of about 50 demonstrators staged sit-down strikes at about two dozen rail and road intersections in and around Dhaka, a city of 7 million people. Protesters paraded through the streets shouting "Down with Ershad!" and "Days of Autocracy Are Over!" The blockade was the latest tactic in the campaign by opposition parties to force Ershad to quit. He later resigned from the military and was elected president in 1986 in balloting that opposition parties, foreign diplomats and journalists said was rigged. The opposition parties say they will boycott the vote unless Ershad resigns and hands over power to a caretaker government.
