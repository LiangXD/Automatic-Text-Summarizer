The government of the northern republic of Slovenia said Friday that Serbia, in the south and east, is attempting to "oust us from Yugoslavia." The statement from the Slovenian presidency followed Serbia's decision Tuesday to ban all political and economic contacts with Slovenia. Slovenia issued an order Tuesday banning the rally and Serbia reacted by severing relations with Slovenia. In its statement, Slovenia's collective presidency called Serbia's action "a flagrant violation of all constitutional, legal and civilized norms." Aleksandar Prlja, Serbia's secretary for foreign affairs, told The Associated Press that Slovenia's "banning of the peaceful rally was deeply humiliating for the Serbian people. The Serbian news media on Friday accused Slovenia of "fascist-like" behavior and called for the resignation of Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek, a Slovene. It called Serbia's imposition of an economic boycott a "declaration of war" and said Slovenia would respond by "opening itself to the world, introducing greater democracy and by holding free elections."
