Two days of racially charged hearings on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds. The racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special hearings called by a City Council committee to look into allegations of police brutality against blacks. Daley is filling the remaining two years of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he died in November 1987. Daley has denounced the alleged police brutality. "I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago," Daley said. At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs. The poice department's record was defended by Police Superintendent LeRoy Martin, a black appointee of Washington.
