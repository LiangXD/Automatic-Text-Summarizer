A coalition of members of Congress announced Wednesday that they plan to sue the Census Bureau in an effort to force the agency to delete illegal aliens from its count in 1990. Census officials say they are required to count everyone by the U.S. Constitution which does not mention citizenship but only instructs that the House apportionment be based on the "whole number of persons" residing in the various states. That approach was upheld by a federal court in a similar suit, brought by the same immigration reform group, before the 1980 Census.
