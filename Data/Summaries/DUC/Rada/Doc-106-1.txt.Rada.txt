Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six Western states, and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long-handled nets. Officials said 566 Gila trout were fished out of Diamond Creek in southwestern New Mexico, put in containers on mules and horses, loaded onto trucks and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery. Much of the creek was contaminated by ash from the lightning-caused Divide fire, which started June 30 and burned about 10,000 acres 150 miles southwest of Albuquerque, said Forest Service spokeswoman Andrea Garcia. Lightning sparked three small fires Thursday and today, but firefighters were extinguishing them today, said Willie Zapata, U.S. Forest Service dispatcher in Gila. Firefighters on Thursday said they had contained the 2,000-acre Livermore Fire west of Fort Collins, Colo., in Roosevelt National Forest, the last of three major fires in Colorado to be encircled by firefighters. Earlier, firefighters contained the Black Tiger fire which covered 2,000 acres in Boulder Canyon and destroyed dozens of homes, and halted a 2,600-acre fire in Mesa Verde National Monument in southwestern Colorado. Arizona firefighters mopped up hot spots in several small fires, and only one blaze in the state was not fully contained. Forest officials in Nebraska shifted their attention Thursday from firefighting to seeding grass and planting trees. The blaze blackened acres of ponderosa pine trees, many of them 60 to 80 years old, said U.S. Forest Service Fire Staff Officer Jim Carson. The storms dampened a fire in Bridger-Teton National Forest that had burned nearly 3,500 acres. But one official with the Wyoming Interagency Fire Coordination Center warned the break in the fire season will probably be short-lived.
