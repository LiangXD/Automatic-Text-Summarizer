CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with Beijing. The challenge was immediately rejected by the Hong Kong government, which accused China of violating Anglo-Chinese agreements and its own law for Hong Kong which comes into force after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in June 1997. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese government, in a dispatch released through the Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, said that all contracts, leases and agreements signed and ratified by the Hong Kong government would be invalid after June 30 1997 unless they were first approved by China. Share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange fell nearly 3 per cent in trading yesterday, although this was largely in response to comments by a senior Chinese official late last week over the validity of the award of land to a consortium to build a container terminal in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government responded to China's latest attack by declaring that Beijing was in breach of both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future and the 1990 Basic Law - the colony's post-1997 constitution - drafted by Beijing.
