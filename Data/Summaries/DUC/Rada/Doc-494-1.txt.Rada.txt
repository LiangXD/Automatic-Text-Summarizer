But the silky steeliness displayed during the crisis by Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has revived discussion of moving Vice President Dan Quayle out to make room for the general on the 1992 Republican ticket.; Yet there is some evidence to suggest that if Powell ever decided to seek elected office, he might be at least as comfortable running as a Democrat.; No one, of course, can imagine Powell carrying the Democratic banner next year against President Bush, his commander-in-chief. But Powell's ultimate political fate does not now seem likely to be decided in the coming election.; It is true that many Republican strategists say nightly prayers for Bush to replace Quayle with Powell in 1992. And, as the general's career unfolds, Democrats should not assume his loyalties lie irrevocably with the GOP.; To begin with, no one knows Powell's political affiliation. Clearly, his positions on foreign policy and the aggressive use of U.S. force abroad fall within the mainstream of the GOP, not the post-McGovern Democrats.; But on domestic issues, Powell has signaled values that reflect the experiences that shaped him -- a course that led him down roads many Republicans see only from inside their cars, with the windows sealed and the doors locked.; Powell is, after all, not a product of comfortable suburbia, but a son of Jamaican immigrants who was born in Harlem, grew up in the South Bronx, watched his parents struggle to earn a living as a sales clerk and a seamstress in New York's garment district, attended the public City College of New York and joined the ROTC during the 1950s, partly because it was one of the few institutions offering opportunities to blacks.; Though some blacks have criticized Powell for being too cautious in addressing issues of concern to African-Americans, he has, on several occasions, pointedly indicated that he has not forgotten those struggles. Rather, if he choose a political career as a Democrat, Powell could revive the tattered tradition of the party's Henry Scoop Jackson wing that combined an assertive domestic policy with tough convictions on defending U.S. interests abroad.; The bottom line is that Powell presents intriguing opportunities for both parties. Nominating Powell to a future national ticket offers Republicans the chance to cement their presidential majority by breaking the Democratic hold on black votes.; For Democrats, conversely, a national slot for Powell could allow the party to simultaneously affirm its commitment to equal opportunity and dispatch persistent doubts about whether it is tough enough to protect American interests in an unstable world.; If Powell hints even the slightest interest, and Democrats are uncharacteristically alert, it could set off the kind of bipartisan bidding war not seen since 1948, when activists in both parties tried to draft Eisenhower as their presidential candidate.
