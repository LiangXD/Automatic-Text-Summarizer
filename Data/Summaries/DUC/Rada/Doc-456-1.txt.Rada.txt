MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday gave China until the end of the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. After more than six hours of discussions with Lu Ping, director of the Chinese cabinet's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, Mr Patten said: 'I cannot say we reached a meeting of minds on what I put forward.' This is Mr Patten's first visit to China as governor of Hong Kong. On October 7, Mr Patten presented plans for the conduct of the colony's 1994 local and 1995 legislative elections which provide for much greater democracy than has previously been the case in Hong Kong. They should be 'fair', 'open and honest', and 'acceptable to the people of Hong Kong', he said. Mr Patten said that he was prepared to meet Lu 'at any time and in any place' to reach agreement but had reminded the Chinese they had only until the end of the year. Although Mr Patten did not say so yesterday, he has suggested in the past that he would be prepared to introduce his proposals for a slightly faster pace of democratic development in Hong Kong without China's approval.
