When his owner died in 1846, Scott sued in the state courts of Missouri for his freedom, on the ground that he had lived in free territory. Scott appealed to the federal courts, since the person he was actually suing, John Sanford, the executor of the estate that owned Scott, lived in New York. That black people, whether free or slave, were not citizens of the U.S.; therefore, they had no standing in court. Much less known are his equally racist pronouncements denying black people, whether slave or free, specific constitutional protections enjoyed by whites. In Dred Scott Chief Justice Taney, writing for the court's majority, stated that if blacks were entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens,... {i}t would give persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one state of the union, the right... to keep and carry arms wherever they went. Gun control was never an issue in America until after the Civil War when black slaves were freed. It was this change in the status of the black man, from slave to freeman, that caused racist elements in the country (North and South) to agitate for restrictions on guns -- ignoring long established customs and understanding of the Second Amendment. The specter of a black man with rights of a freeman, bearing arms, was too much for the early heirs of Roger Taney to bear. The 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, along with the various Reconstruction civil rights acts, prevented gun prohibitionists from making laws that were explicitly racist and that would overtly deny black people the right to bear arms. Throughout the history of New York state's Sullivan law, enacted at the start of the 20th century, mainly the rich and powerful have had easy access to licenses to carry handguns.
