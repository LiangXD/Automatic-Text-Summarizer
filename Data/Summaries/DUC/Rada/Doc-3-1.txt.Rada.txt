Mad cow disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry. On Friday, West Germany joined France in a ban on British beef imports, citing health fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the mad cow scare. Therefore, British officials believe, France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. The United States does not import British beef and recently rescinded permits for the importation of live cattle. Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently. On May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that a Siamese cat had died from a disease identical to BSE. Beef sales dropped, with surveys showing that about a quarter of British households had stopped eating it. Some regulations were enacted to fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne said her family was still eating British beef.
