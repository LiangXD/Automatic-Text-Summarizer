Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun. The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening, when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weather with a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday. The solar eclipse in Finland starts at 4:03 a.m. After the total phase of the eclipse, the moon will move away, uncovering more and more of the sun. In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon. At Joensuu, 310 miles northeast of Helsinki, the sun will be 5 degrees above the horizon in the total phase at a better angle for watchers. During the past week, newspapers, television and radio have been full of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice for spectators not to stare directly into the sun. The eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide from the northern Baltic Sea and southeast Finland, across the Kola Peninsula and northeast Soviet Union, to the Aleutian Islands near Alaska. The last total eclipse to be seen in Finland occurred in 1945.
