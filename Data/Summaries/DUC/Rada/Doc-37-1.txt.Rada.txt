President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a Cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as "the slar eclipse of the century" on July 11. This one will cut a swath across one of the most populous regions of the globe, turning day to night for an estimated 50 million residents in 14 of Mexico's 31 states. The eclipse path reaches from Hawaii through Mexico to Brazil. On July 11, the moon will pass between the planet and the sun, abruptly swallowing midday's light, except for a weird glow on the horizon. People from British Columbia to Buenos Aires will experience at least a partial eclipse. The commission bills the northwestern state of Baja California Sur as the best place to watch because the state has an average of 300 cloudless days a year. Baja California Sur alone plans to spend $26.5 million for public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in millions more from tourism. Most hotels along the eclipse route are full for July 11. Baja California Sur's tourist facilities can only handle 120,000 visitors, and 90 percent of that capacity is booked, tourism director Rodolfo Palacios says. The state says at least four ships will pressed into service as floating hotels. The National University is developing six half-hour documentaries on eclipses and 10 TV spots on the dangers of looking at the sun, astronomy professor Jesus Galindo says.
