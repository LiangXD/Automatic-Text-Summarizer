President Reagan warned Saturday that he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him that does not contain a work requirement. Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his administration's economic record, saying Friday's unemployment figures showed that the jobless rate "hovered just above the lowest it's been in 14 years." "I will not accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people independent of welfare." "Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform," the president said. The House bill, with training and education programs as well as health and child-care benefits, would make welfare parents who work better off than those who do not, said Downey, acting chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance and unemployment compensation. "Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary, but those requirements should be controlled by state and local officials who administer our welfare programs, not federal bureaucrats," Downey said.
