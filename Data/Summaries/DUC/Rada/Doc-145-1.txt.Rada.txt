Sir, Mr James Skinner (Letters, April 11) charges me with misuse of statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries. The debts of African countries have often been cancelled or rescheduled, frequently several times for the same country. I do not know what Mr Skinner has in mind in referring to institutions serving only western interests, and by clear implication inflict suffering on the poor. State help for the poorest, especially the rural poor, conflicts with the political and personal interests of the rulers, and may not accord with local mores. An Arab-dominated Sudanese government will not help the poorest blacks hundreds of miles away with whom it is in armed conflict; the Sinhalese government will not help the Tamil poor, nor will the government of Ethiopia the poor of Tigre. Encouraging Third World countries to default inhibits the inflow of productive commercial capital, which, together with the skills that went with it, over the last 150 years transformed life in many poor countries, notably in south-east Asia, west Africa and Latin America.
