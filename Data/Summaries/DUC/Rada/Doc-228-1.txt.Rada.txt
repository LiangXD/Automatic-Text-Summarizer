MR HARRY Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and De Beers, is to visit Russia next week at a time when the republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamond industry. His visit also comes at a time when the beleaguered diamond industry is rife with rumours about unofficial exports from Russia contributing to the present market turmoil which might force De Beers to cut its dividend payment this year. De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, in 1990 signed a Dollars 5bn, five-year sales contract with the former Soviet Union and at the same time advanced a loan of Dollars 1bn. After the break-up of the Soviet Union the contract was continued with Rosalmazzoloto, the Russian gold and diamond organisation, and an exclusive sales agreement was later signed with Yukutia, the area in eastern Siberia where most Russian diamonds are mined and which is now an autonomous republic in the Russian Federation. These proposals are being opposed by the Yakut government, which is backing a joint-stock company, Almazy Rossli (Diamonds of Russia), being set up with Mr Valery Rudakov, formerly in charge of Rosalmazzoloto, at its head. Observers expect Mr Oppenheimer to bring his formidable negotiating skills to bear to ensure that De Beers grip on the diamond market is in no way weakened by any changes in Russia. Meanwhile, the newsletter, which is available only to subscribers to Diamond International magazine, also says that reports in Antwerp suggest that two of the Belgian diamond trading organisations with which the CSO has a special relationship have been punished by temporarily being excluded from the CSO's 'sights' or diamond sales.
