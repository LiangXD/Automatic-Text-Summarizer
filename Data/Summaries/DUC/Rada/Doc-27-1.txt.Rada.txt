The accidental shooting death of a young stockbroker by an officer looking for a burglar is one more strike against a police force already struggling with allegations of brutality and racism. Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong. It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year. Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens. Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said. An officer encountered Barnes, unarmed, in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, standing in his bedroom, police spokesman Sgt. Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar and whether he would have lunged at the officer. "We are defending the officers being in that apartment," Mills said. In June, several white officers bloodied a Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the ground. In May, another black clergyman was hit on the head with a shotgun by a white officer while lying on the ground. In another case, three undercover officers were suspended for a shooting this spring that left a young black man crippled. The officer who shot Barnes was a two-year veteran of the force. "This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr. Barnes' family and for this officer," Bishop said.
