Coast Guard and Navy aircraft and vessels today searched for a crewman missing from an F-14 jet fighter that plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off North Carolina while practicing combat maneuvers, killing his crewmate, officials said. Six people were injured in another F-14 crash Monday after two Navy aviators bailed out of their jet over an airfield in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, sending it smashing into a hangar. The crash off Hatteras, N.C., occurred Monday afternoon 22 miles east of Oregon Inlet, the Navy said. Five people, including the two Navy fliers, remained hospitalized today following the crash Monday morning in El Cajon 15 miles east of San Diego. Authorities said the two crewman tried to guide the jet to the runway at Gillespie Field before bailing out. The jet passed within a mile of an elementary school. Mike John, a spokesman for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet air force in Norfolk, Va., said the plane was engaged in mock dogfights with another F-14 and an A-4 jet in restricted military airspace off the North Carolina coast. In northern Utah today, an F-16A jet fighter crashed west of Hill Air Force Base after the pilot bailed out, a base spokeswoman said. The aircraft, assigned to Hill's 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, was on a routine training mission.
