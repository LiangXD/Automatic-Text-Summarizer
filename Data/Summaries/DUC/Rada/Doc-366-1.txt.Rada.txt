As the Senate takes up Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, we would like to believe that there might be some senators among his declared opponents with the statesmanship to admit they were initially misinformed. The true record of Judge Bork could not be more different from the claims of Archie Bunker ads and Archie Bunker senators. Contrary to the smears, Robert Bork has not been a racist, sexist, sterilizer or bedroom spy in his careers as Yale law professor, U.S. solicitor general or appeals judge. The lobbyists actually did a poll to find the best issues for distorting Judge Bork's views. Even Harvard's Laurence Tribe got into the game by mischaracterizing Judge Bork's Ninth Amendment views, not to mention Justice Black's. A Harris Poll that included a falsified quote from Judge Bork was trumpeted to prove that most Americans opposed Judge Bork. Now, to justify supporting this assault, the supposedly statesmanlike Howell Heflin is attacking Judge Bork from the right. The liberal Advocacy Institute has scheduled a seminar for Monday on how the left beat Judge Bork. The symbols they created for Judge Bork were brazen lies about a distinguished jurist.
