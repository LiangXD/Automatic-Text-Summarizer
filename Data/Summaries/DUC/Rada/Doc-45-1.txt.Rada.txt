Rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced the beginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from April through June across Texas and other Tornado Alley states in the nation's heartland. "People should have plans of what they'll do in tornadoes. In mid-November, 11 people died in East Texas when a series of tornadoes trashed towns from Cherokee County to the Gulf Coast. "A tornado is such a devastating kind of storm. A watch means weather conditions are suitable for development of a tornado, and people should keep a careful lookout for potential funnel clouds. James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for Disaster Research at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly try to outrun tornadoes in their cars. During the 1979 Wichita Falls tornado that killed 53, McDonald said, "people jumped in their cars and drove down Main Street at 90 mph." McIntyre said there are enough natural openings in a house to equalize air pressure, and "if that tornado wants to open your windows, it'll do that for you."
