Tapia emphasized that the Shining Path faction led by Abimael Guzman Reinoso enjoys government favor, and among other things has been given assistance in organizing a second party congress. Tapia said: The Shining Path was defeated, but it seems that after the beginning of negotiations, Abimael Guzman's leadership has been consolidated, tied to the commitment to organize a second party congress. The documents of this second congress are being prepared to make the Shining Path stop engaging in armed actions. Tapia believes the government is seeking to strengthen Abimael Guzman's leadership within Shining Path, countering the hardline faction led by Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka Feliciano. Guzman's faction, Tapia said, represents the imprisoned Shining Path, while the one led by Feliciano is made up of the terrorists who are still free.
