THE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issued today by Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president. These would form the basis for a 'collaborative approach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank'. Mr Preston's emphasis on poverty is a reaction to bank policies in the 1980s, when the aim was to improve economic efficiency in developing countries. The new directive says structural adjustment lending in the past decade 'overshadowed the bank's poverty reduction objectives'.
