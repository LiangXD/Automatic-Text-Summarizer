If the 6.7 percent average annual decline had kept up through the late 1980s, an estimated 14,768 fewer TB cases would have been expected during 1985-1988, the CDC said in its weekly report. Tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988, as compared with 1985, but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6 percent among Hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higher rates of AIDS cases. In 1988, 7,720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites, compared with 8,280 in blacks and 3,637 in Hispanics. But the number of new cases is only part of the toll from tuberculosis, the CDC said. Tuberculosis, which is curable in most cases with drug treatment, killed 1,755 Americans in 1987.
