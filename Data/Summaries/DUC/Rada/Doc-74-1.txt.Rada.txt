A B-52 bomber crashed and burst into flames early today on a runway while practicing "touch-and-go" landings at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, officials said. The plane, normally equipped to carry nuclear bombs, crashed about 1:15 a.m., said Lt. All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman. Members of the crew suffered broken bones, but no one was burned, said Capt. Mark Hartney, 29, an aircraft commander from Mulberry, Fla.; 1st Lt. Ann Parent, a spokeswoman for Marquette General Hospital, said Hartney and Debruzzi were in fair condition, Phillips and Vallie were in stable condition, McCarrick was in satisfactory condition and Kroeger was in serious condition. Hartney was the aircraft commander, but Debruzzi also was qualified to fly the plane, Bailey said. The accident was classified as the most serious kind, and all aircraft exercises at Sawyer were canceled even though runways other than the one where the crash occurred remained open, Bailey said. In other accidents involving B-52s, a bomber was damaged when a pilot aborted a takeoff and overshot a runway at Castle Air Force Base in central California on Feb.

The Air Force has had more trouble recently with the B-52's successor, the B-1B bomber. One of the $280 million B-1Bs was destroyed after smashing onto a runway at Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D., during a training flight on Nov. 8, a B-1B crashed and burned in a field near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas. 11 when an Air Force tanker en route from K.I.
