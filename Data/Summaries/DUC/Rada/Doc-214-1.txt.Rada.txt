Everyone's going to have to be extra careful. ; In Santa Clara County, the conditions are not yet extreme; March storms probably delayed fire season until mid-June.; But the county's wild lands are littered with heavy fuel -- brush and trees -- killed by the drought or the December freeze.; The late rains have given us a real good grass crop, the catalyst to ignite heavier fuels, said fire prevention officer Dick Mauldin at the forestry department's Morgan Hill ranger unit.; Particularly vulnerable are the eucalyptus groves that did not survive the freeze, Mauldin said. Summer weather will be the key to how severe this fire season is.; If we get into a period of temperatures in the 90s and 100s and it stays that way for a week or so, there is some real potential for major fires, Mauldin said.; Firefighters are most concerned about rural areas of the South Bay and East Bay where people have built homes among heavy vegetation.; We preach every year for homeowners to take precautions (such as clearing brush from around their houses), and a lot of people don't do it, Mauldin said. We have to be prepared. ; Statewide, the biggest fire threat looms in the chaparral-covered coastal mountains south of Santa Barbara, where the moisture content of trees and shrubs is the lowest ever recorded for this time of year, Boyd said.; Every year the drought continues, the conditions get more explosive, but we can't say for sure what is going to happen this year, Boyd said.; Two of the forestry department's 22 ranger units -- both in Southern California -- are fully staffed for the fire season now, Boyd said, and all are expected to be ready by mid-June.; California doesn't face the fire threat alone.; Officials at the federal Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates firefighting efforts throughout the West, said parts of 11 states in the far West, and North Dakota and Minnesota, also face major fire danger this year.; Wildfire precautions; The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection advises residents of rural areas to take special precautions to protect their homes from wildfires this summer:; (box)Clear at least a 30-foot defensible space of brush and dry grass around your house.
