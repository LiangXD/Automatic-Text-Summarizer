It concentrated on the most severe drought region, centered in nine states of the Midwest and upper Great Plains. Basic findings: _Net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to an average of $28,899 per farm from $38,122 in 1987. It also includes allowances for changes in the value of inventories and adjustments for depreciation and other factors. _Despite drought, farms in all areas of the country continued to improve their solvency position in 1988. _The number of farms considered financially vulnerable continued to decrease in 1988 in both the drought and non-drought regions. _Farms in the drought region received lower direct government payments in 1988, despite an infusion of federal disaster relief. _The average farm in the drought region survived financially by selling off inventories and taking advantage of higher commodity market prices to redeem price support loans made by USDA's Commodity Credit Corp. The nine states studied as the "drought region" were Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. In the category of net farm income, the report said the share of farms in a "favorable financial position" in 1988 held fairly steady at 68 percent in the non-drought region, compared with 69.1 percent in 1987. In the drought states, 62.2 percent of the farms were said to be in favorable financial position, compared with 62.8 percent in 1987. "Even with lower incomes, farmers in the drought region continued to improve their debt position (in relation to assets)," the report said. The report noted that higher market prices helped reduce the direct payments to farmers in 1988 under USDA's commodity programs. "This tick, which carries bovine babesiosis _ a serious cattle disease often called Texas cattle fever _ was eradicated from the United States in 1943," said James W.
