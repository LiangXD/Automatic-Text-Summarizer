In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won. Democratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor had spirited competition in 1984 when he won with 57%; this year he has no opponent at all. Senators have become just as brazen as their House brethren in shutting out competition. Critics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not -- it's wrong to blame Congress for the now nearly 100% re-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for. Michael Kinsley writes in the New Republic that if incumbents always win, it's because voters can't be bothered. That takes money, and skewed campaign finance laws combined with taxpayer-paid junk mail effectively mean that only incumbents have the cash to make themselves known and to be taken seriously by the media. Some complain that limiting terms would infringe on democracy by not allowing voters to elect whom they please. The polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way they can control Congress effectively is by limiting terms. The number of freshmen in a new House never dipped below 30% until 1901. In the current House it is 8%. The opinion polls for term limitation show that the voters don't like the change.
