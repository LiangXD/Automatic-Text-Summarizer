While Angel and his followers meditate to prepare for their journey, French New Age musician Jean-Michel Jarre is coordinating an elaborate sound-and-light show to play at the foot of the pyramids in Teotihuacan, north of the capital.; Also on E-day, July 11, crowded cruise ships will linger off Mexico's Pacific Coast, and thousands of U.S. tourists will drive south into Baja California, which, usually boasting clear skies, is being billed as the world's most promising site from which to view nature's own light show.; Eclipse fans from Japan to New York to the Netherlands are expected in droves, but Californians -- because of their proximity to Baja and propensity for mystical phenomena -- should be conspicuous.; However, the chic hot spot for eclipse watchers won't be Mexico, but the big island of Hawaii, where the 18,000 tourists who would be there anyway to enjoy the sunshine will be joined by an additional 30,000 or more coming to watch the sun go out for four minutes.; Even more people might be there for the show, but for the lack of seats on flights to the island. Most visitors will be funneled in through the relatively small airport at Kailua.; Airlines are adding scores of flights to ferry thousands of people from neighboring islands in the hours just before the eclipse.; Car rental companies have shipped in 3,000 or so extra cars.; More than one caller from the mainland has asked the visitors' bureau whether the island is in danger of tipping over under the tourists' weight.; But Mexico will host the biggest share of travelers, partly because of its easy access from the United States and partly since the eclipse will last longest here: up to seven minutes, which is three more minutes than the maximum length in Hawaii. It's going to be total insanity. ; We're worrying that we won't have enough alcohol and food on the island, said the manager of a local restaurant and disco called The Eclipse, named by coincidence 10 years ago.; While authorities fret over infrastructure capacity, many Californians are preparing to revel in a New Age wonderland.; These are people who have never, ever, missed a single episode of 'Star Trek,' said Ken Stewart, who is planning to lead a caravan of 50 enthusiasts from San Diego to Cabo San Lucas, on the south tip of Baja.; Mexico's government is heavily involved in eclipse planning, having formed an Intersecretarial Commission for the Eclipse, which, among other things, is supposed to oversee production of as many as 60 million protective lenses. Staring at the sun during a partial eclipse could quickly -- without your feeling a thing -- burn into your retina a permanent image of the crescent sun, causing severe and permanent vision loss.; (box) It's safest to watch the eclipse indirectly by projecting the sun's image through a pinhole and onto a sheet of white paper.; (box) Other safe methods: (check) Pieces of arc-welders' glass labeled 14 and available at welding supply stores.
