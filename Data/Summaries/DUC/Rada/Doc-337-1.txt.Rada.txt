Britain and the United States have kept their hopes of issuing mining licenses in the Antarctic alive by refusing to accept proposals to turn the continent into a wildlife reserve. Australia and France had proposed that Antarctica be turned into a wilderness park and that the Minerals Convention of 1988, which took six years to negotiate, be scrapped. Britain and the United States refused to discuss this proposal and insisted that the conference should talk about implementing the convention and discuss clauses that would apportion liability in the case of mining pollution. The Minerals Convention creates a framework for mining under strict environmental guidelines. At the end of the conference, it was decided to hold another two meetings in Chile next year. Jim Barnes, from the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, representing 300 environmental organizations, said that the wilderness park proposals were still on the table, something he said gives us more time to push our case.
