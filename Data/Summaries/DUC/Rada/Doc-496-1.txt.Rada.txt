Gen. Colin L. Powell, who is expected to be named the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is described by colleagues as a "soldier's soldier" who doesn't particularly like staff jobs. The four-star Army general, who became national security adviser in 1987 and heads the U.S. Forces Command at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, would become the first black to serve as the nation's senior military officer. A senior administration official said in Washington on Wednesday that President Bush is expected to name Powell to the position. Powell took over U.S. Forces Command, or FORSCOM, in April, putting him in charge of troop readiness and deployment for the U.S. Army. On personal level, however, Powell doesn't always keep up with the times. Washington colleagues have described Powell as a "soldier's soldier" who doesn't like staff jobs. Carlucci says that Powell has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that Reagan got Powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the general had turned Carlucci down several times. On the job, Powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he became FORSCOM commander. As leader of Powell is responsible for the training and preparedness of more than 1 million active, reserve and National Guard troops in the United States. Born in New York, Powell completed training in the Airborne and Ranger schools and served in Germany and Vietnam.
