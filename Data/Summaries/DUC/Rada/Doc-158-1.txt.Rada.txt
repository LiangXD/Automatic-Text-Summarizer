The stripping of Ben Johnson's Olympic gold medal in a drug scandal has wounded Canadian pride and shamed a nation hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky. "It's like Wayne Gretzky getting run over by a car," said Pat Reid, the Canadian high-jump coach. The spirit of a nation raced with Johnson when he won the gold medal in the 100 meters on Saturday with a world record time of 9.79 seconds. Johnson, a 26-year-old Jamaican transplant, waved the Canadian flag in triumph and dedicated his gold to his mother and all Canadian citizens. Johnson's disgrace was heralded in Canadian headlines such as "Fool's Gold," "Black Day For Canada," "Seconds Of Glory, Years Of Shame," "From Fame To Shame," and "Big Ben is Now Has-Ben." Trent Frayne, sports columnist for the Globe and Mail of Toronto, said Johnson's victory was the biggest event in Canada since a national team beat the Soviet Union in a seven-game hockey series in 1972. "The Ben Johnson episode is a tragedy of shocking proportions." He let Canada down," said Donny Clarke, 12. "He has left Canadians hanging their heads in shame," wrote the Corner Brook Western Star. "He tarnished the name and reputation of Canada and let its people down," said the Fredickton Gleaner. But columnist Gary Lautens of the Toronto Star said the nation should not cover its head in shame.
