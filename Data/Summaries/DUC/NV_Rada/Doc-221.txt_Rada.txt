YELLOWSTONE FIRES 1 -- Human-caused fires originating outside of Yellowstone Park 2 -- Natural fires originating within Yellowstone Park 3 -- Natural fires originating on adjacent U.S. Forest Service lands SOURCE: Yellowstone National Park REFORESTATION IN YELLOWSTONE About 80% of the trees burned in the greater Yellowstone Park fires were lodgepole pines, a tree that is self-pruning.Yellowstone officials are making no apologies for their handling of the fires, which they contend was not only ecologically sound but also in concert with then existing park service regulations.Still, Lujan, a former New Mexico congressman appointed to his Cabinet post only this year, said park officials should have "admitted" that they erred in losing control of the blazes.From an ecologist's standpoint, the "let-burn" policy could be the most serious casualty of last year's blazes, which swelled to historic proportions and ultimately seared nearly 1 million of the park's 2.2 million acres."Welcome to the New Yellowstone," reads the headline on a special fire brochure handed to each visitor as they drive into the park.It is sure to leave its mark on future fire and management policies not just at Yellowstone but throughout the vast system of national parks and wilderness areas.However, Marsha Karle, a spokeswoman for the park, said letters and calls logged by Yellowstone operators are about double their usual pace and the number of visitors entering the park so far this spring has been well above normal.Stage 1- Lodgepole pine saplings grow in stands before forming canopy (up to 40 years after a fire).Under the changes, expected to be announced shortly by Bush Administration officials, all parks would have to run through a safety check list that includes an assessment of weather, moisture, winds and available firefighting crews before they could make a decision on whether or not to let a lightning fire burn.Lujan's reservations aside, an internal government review has largely backed up the approach taken by Barbee and other park officials in dealing with the fires.Arguments still rage over the impact of the fires on wildlife, the conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes and the role of the media and others in creating an erroneous impression that a national treasure had somehow been reduced to cinders.On the one hand, they are supposed to be preserves of the past, the last outposts in America where nature is allowed to take its course with as little intrusion as possible from man.The Interior Department, parent of the National Park Service, has already ordered a summer-long moratorium on its politically sensitive "let-burn" policy, under which lightning-triggered blazes are allowed to burn unless they threaten human lives or property.There are conflicting signals over what impact the fires have had on the tourist trade.It's going to be a picture postcard."Colorful souvenir books detailing the fires in words and pictures are big sellers at curio shops both in the park and gateway communities."If (park superintendent) Barbee were here I'd choke him to death even today," said Betty Morton, a motel owner in tiny Cooke City, where the threat of fire forced a temporary evacuation last September.Expect Many Scientists While the response from tourists is still questionable, the park is bracing for an unprecedented onslaught of scientists looking into everything from fire behavior patterns to its effects on grizzly bears, fisheries, grasslands and the nesting status of bald eagles.However, the chairman of the panel, Duke University botanist Norman L. Christensen, told a congressional hearing last January that he considered the fires to be both natural and beneficial to the Yellowstone environment.They say the park did too little, too late and let the fires get out of hand.Tied to Neighbors But "parks can no longer be considered ecological and sociological islands," Agee told a conference of conservationists here over the weekend.Although less frequent, fires approaching the size of those in 1988 occurred in the 1700s and probably occurred at 200- to 300- year intervals through the Western mountains over the past 10,000 years."May Become Gun-Shy Michael Scott, regional director of the Wilderness Society, said restrictions could lead to a "systematic politicization of ecosystem management" and make officials gun-shy about letting fire burn for any reason."Ecologists are in total agreement that wildfires were a natural part of the primeval North American landscape," Christensen testified."It was a hell of a summer, let me tell you," said Yellowstone Supt.Christensen said that there is ample evidence that such fires kill few animals and ultimately improve their habitat by promoting the growth of plants and shrubs that could not thrive in the gloom of a thick forest."There was no ecological downside to the fires," Barbee said recently.Here is how reforestation process takes place after logging or a fire:Will Keep Job While many critics have called for Barbee's head, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said in an interview that the Yellowstone superintendent was in no danger of losing his job.
