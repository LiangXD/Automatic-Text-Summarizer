Mr. Ferris believes this would "put a vitality in the system" while not resulting, unlike overall term limits, in "a bunch of neophytes who'd be more dependent on staff and lobbyists."A powerful antidote would be to limit committee service, which would have few of the political and constitutional drawbacks of term limits.If lawmakers had to change areas of expertise every three or four terms, "they wouldn't have the luxury of being intellectually lazy."Term limits would accomplish few of their proponents' goals -- more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists.Why shouldn't the Commerce committees and the tax-writing and appropriations panels be subjected to the same limits?Argues Mr. Ferris: "Voters never should be prevented from electing a person who they think is the best representative of that community.""This really would challenge these guys to shake up the system," says Mr. Fenno, noting that the power of interest groups is centered in committees.While both men are deeply dismayed at the current state of Congress, they see term limits as a cure worse than the illness.
