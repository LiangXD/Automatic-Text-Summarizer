Michael Milken, who faces insider trading charges, is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made "junk-bond" financing into the tool of choice for corporate raiders.It was business as usual at Drexel, and Milken was still king of the junk bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate takeovers.It had been a relatively short road for Milken, from head cheerleader at Birmingham High School in the San Fernando Valley in 1964 _ actress Sally Field and superagent Michael Ovitz were among his classmates _ to the top of the nation's financial industry.After studying business at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Milken went to work for Drexel Firestone &amp; Co. in Philadelphia as a junior bond trader.Drexel merged with Burnham &amp; Co. in 1973 and Lambert Brussels Witter in 1976 to become today's Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Milken's job was moved to New York.Although the move by the Securities and Exchange Commission had been anticipated, Milken and others who have made fortunes in junk bonds continued to hold their annual Beverly Hills spring gathering known as the Predators' Ball.In the years before the insider trading scandal, the financial media wrote glowingly of Milken.
