A tornado blasted through this North Florida town before dawn today, destroying several homes and a college library, blowing off rooftops, flipping cars and leaving four people dead and 15 injured, officials said.In the eastern Georgia's Bulloch County, six mobile homes and one house were heavily damaged shortly after dawn today, but no injuries were reported, the weather service said.Two of the deaths occurred in mobile homes blown apart by the tornado, and four other houses were seriously damaged as well, said Madison County Civil Defense Director Bernard Wilson.Three homes and a trailer were destroyed and five homes seriously damaged, he said, and two people were slightly injured.A house-to-house search found no more bodies, but a man and a baby had to be freed from separate homes where they were trapped, Peavy said.Two tornadoes struck near the towns of Malone and Bascom, about 100 miles to the west of Madison, said Jackson County emergency management director John Mader."There was this huge roar and then I heard a tree crack out there and thought we were all gone," said Marie Prince, a Madison County sheriff's dispatcher.
