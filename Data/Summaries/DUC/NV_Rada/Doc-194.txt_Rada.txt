A telefaxed communique, purportedly from the Medellin drug cartel, denied responsibility Friday for the assassination of presidential candidate Carlos Pizarro, who died in a hail of bullets Thursday aboard a Colombian jetliner carrying 97 people.They apparently were part of an assassination squad with orders to kill Pizarro if he survived the flight, police said.But on Thursday, within hours of Pizarro's assassination, a man had called the national radio network station Caracol and related in detail how the cartel had allegedly ordered the former guerrilla's killing.Government officials had said Pizarro could have helped mediate peace agreements with other leftist insurgents.Governing party candidate Cesar Gaviria, the presidential front-runner, suspended campaign activities following the Pizarro killing.With a third presidential candidate assassinated, Colombia's government refused Friday to put off next month's election and vowed to keep up the fight against drug traffickers.Leaders of the leftist Patriotic Union Party, whose candidate was slain last month, urged the government to cancel the May 27 vote.
