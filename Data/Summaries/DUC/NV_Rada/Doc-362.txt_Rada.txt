The campaign against Judge Bork is shrill, mean and anti-intellectualan assault on the notion of law itself.Law is just politics, judges just politicians in robes.Not one of the 416 opinions he has written or joined has been overturned by the Supreme Court.Lloyd Cutler, counsel to President Carter, supports Judge Bork as a jurist who "believes that judges should interpret the Constitution and the laws according to neutral principles, without reference to their personal views as to desirable social or legislative policy."One case where Judge Bork ruled for a labor union against a federal agency was classified by critics as "pro-business" because unions are "in the business" of representing workers.Despite his pre-eminent qualifications, in the last few weeks an awful fury has been unleashed against Judge Bork, centered on the canard that he is somehow outside the legal mainstream.Judge Robert Bork is the most qualified American alive to serve on the Supreme Court.Any likely alternative, such as Orrin Hatch, would be a much more activist judge, though a far less distinguished one.Judge Bork is the leading proponent of judicial restraint.This doctrine is nothing more radical than the assumption of our constitutional democracy that judges must be the "least dangerous branch."Many federal judges look to his 1984 lecture on "Tradition and Morality in Constitutional Law" as a guide to approaching constitutional issues.
