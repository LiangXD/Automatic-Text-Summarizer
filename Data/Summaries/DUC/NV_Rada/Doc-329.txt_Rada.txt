And the course of Sherman Adams' humiliation may even allow us a perspective on the course of John Sununu's struggle for survival and possibly even a way to predict the timing of his ultimate demise.; That Sherman Adams, the first "assistant president" and John Sununu, conceivably the last of the imperial chiefs of staff, were both catapulted from governor of the Granite state into national prominence is not at all coincidental.In 1940, at the behest of his employers, he ran for a seat in the New Hampshire House, eventually becoming governor in 1949.; When he took office, Adams began a program of streamlining and reducing state government that provided a model followed three decades later for another new New Hampshire governor, John Sununu.; In late 1951, New Hampshire was the launching pad for the campaign of Dwight D. Eisenhower.; Eisenhower, with Adams' support, defeated the isolationist Sen.The year 1958 was the beginning of the Democratic renaissance that led to the election of John Kennedy in 1960.; Today, as Vice President Dan Quayle could tell you, John Sununu is no Sherman Adams.The Wall Street Journal noted that Sununu "became an extremely powerful figure in a state where the powers of governor are not great."; More or less the same thing could have been said about Sherman Adams when he gave up the New Hampshire governorship to become Dwight Eisenhower's "assistant president" in 1953.; The reason for Adams' enormous power lay in the nature of the Eisenhower presidency.And he wasn't even named John Sununu.; But the rise and fall of Sherman Adams, President Eisenhower's powerful chief-of-staff, is more than an interesting political doppleganger to the travails of his lineal heir, John Sununu.That ploy, plus a computerized get-out-the-vote campaign, crafted by Sununu on his own spreadsheet program, did the trick, and the rest is history.; Unlike Sherman Adams, John Sununu could not be mistaken for a rock-ribbed Granite Stater.Sununu is as brash as Adams was self-effacing and far more self-serving than Adams at his vicuna-coat worst.In the early '60s, he began building a solid career running the several engineering firms he founded and also became a professor of physics at Tufts University.; Sununu was elected to the New Hampshire Assembly in 1972, and 10 years later became governor of New Hampshire on a conservative campaign theme of nuclear power, increased business and no new taxes.; It was a propitious era to be governor of New Hampshire.
