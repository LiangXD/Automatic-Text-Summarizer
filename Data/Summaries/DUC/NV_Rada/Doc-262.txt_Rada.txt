Counterinsurgency sources said Morote's capture will create a power vacuum within the central committee of the Shining Path and spark tension until a replacement is found.Guzman, Morote and other Shining Path leaders went underground in the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war, which has claimed more than 10,000 lives.Police captured the top military leader of the Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war has taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said Monday.Morote, known within the rebel band as "Comrade Remigio," is second in importance only to Guzman, who founded the Shining Path as a splinter group of the Peruvian Communist Party.Officials said the capture of Osman Morote, 43, considered the most radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to date for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the Andean highlands in May 1980.
