Sununu even tried to manipulate his boss on occasion, with the effect that Bush looked weak and waffling.; When the glow faded from the Persian Gulf war, and the country began looking to the White House for leadership on the stagnant economy and the pain of many Americans, the president once again allowed himself to be guided by Sununu and his closest White House ally, Richard Darman, the budget chief.; Sununu and Darman urged the president to follow his instincts that there was nothing he could do about the economy and that he should not even try to come up with a drastic plan.; Moreover, in the recent fiasco about caps on credit card interest rates, Sununu did something that is never done in a city that operates strictly on hierarchy: He blamed the mess on his boss, going on national television to say Bush had "ad-libbed" the idea in a speech.; Bush appeared out of sync with the country.15, in a five-page handwritten letter to Bush as they flew to Florida for a speech at a juice factory Tuesday.; The former New Hampshire governor, ending weeks of speculation and criticism of his performance, told Bush in the letter he "would never want to not be contributing positively, much less be a drag on your success."; In thinly veiled comments, Sununu made it clear that he felt betrayed because, in many ways, he was doing exactly what Bush had hired him to do.; The departing chief of staff was also obliquely reminding the president that this was not a matter of principle, but of ratings; his bullying tactics had been fine as long as the opinion polls did not go down.; "I assure you that in pit-bull mode or pussycat mode (your choice, as always), I am ready to help," Sununu wrote.; His reference was sardonic.
