The global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of a more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these abnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought, he said.They noted that when asked what caused the drought that hit much of North America in 1988, meteorologists often reply "the jet stream was displaced northward of its usual position so that storms, which tend to track along the path of the jet stream, were similarly displaced northward."Some of this year's drought in the Midwest may have been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, according to a new computer study reported Thursday.
