Davidson said he is confident that Latinos will respond to education efforts on diabetes.That is why the American Diabetes Assn. and other health education groups in the Los Angeles area and California have begun a major push to educate Latinos about diabetes.Nationwide, it is estimated that there are more than 2 million Latinos who already have diabetes, many of them undiagnosed.Like heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among Latinos is a condition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors say."We need to give them the opportunity to enter the health care system, and we need to give them the opportunity to learn that diabetes is the biggest health care issue that they are going to face into the year 2000."Chief among these is that the Latino patient is less likely to volunteer information or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the Anglo patient, said Dr. Aliza Lifshitz, a board member of the California Hispanic American Medical Assn.The effort is being aided by interested physicians and by drug companies, which make insulin and other drugs used for diabetes that can't be controlled by changes in eating habits."We need to get into the communities and start teaching the kids and the adolescents and the parents to make some changes in their habits," said Dr. Jaime Davidson, a Dallas physician who has spearheaded the diabetes association's Latino education efforts.If you have already a predisposed group of people, such as the Latinos, you get more obesity and you get more diabetes."For instance, the fact that Type II diabetes frequently shows up in women during or shortly after pregnancy gives health educators an ideal chance to influence an entire Latino family's eating habits, said Dr. Martin Montoro, co-director of the diabetes and pregnancy service at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.In addition, Latino diets can be rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote obesity and increase the chance of getting diabetes.Consuelo and Abuelita aren't actual people, but their story nevertheless is played over and over again among the more than 3 million Latinos in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, health officials say.Other barriers to Latinos getting care for diabetes are more subtle, doctors interested in the issue say.Any Latino woman whose child was born at 9 pounds or larger should consider herself at risk of diabetes and alter her diet, Davidson said.Latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are Anglos, and incidence of the disease increases with age."In some states like California or Texas, if nothing is done we're going to pay so much money for health care for people of Latino origin that it may become prohibitive."Latinos, who often have less access to regular health care than Anglos, are more likely to go undiagnosed, Matkin said.The reason is diabetes, a silent killer that afflicts one in eight Latino adults.
