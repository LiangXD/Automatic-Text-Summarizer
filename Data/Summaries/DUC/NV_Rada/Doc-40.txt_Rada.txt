Also, its 150-mile-wide path across Hawaii, Baja California, Mexico City and four Central American capital cities "puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history," says Alan Dyer, an editor of Astronomy magazine.; Finally, since the center of the shadow will pass right across the world's largest cluster of astronomical observatories, the audience will include several dozen solar scientists intent on getting the best view they've ever had.; "It's going to be great from up there on the mountain," said Harold Zirin, a California Institute of Technology astronomer who will be at one of the observatories atop Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that makes up a large piece of the island of Hawaii.; Historic events; For science, two eclipses have proved especially historic: In 1868, spectroscopic study of the sun's halo turned up evidence of a new element, which was named helium, from Helios, the Greek sun god.On average, any point on Earth is eclipsed just once every 360 years.; But when the shadow's narrow path does cross inhabited areas, people flock there to experience "totality" -- to watch the light snap off and the stars snap on, and to gaze at the sun's shaggy corona hanging in the dark sky for a few minutes before daylight abruptly returns.; In the United States, the opportunity has come twice in the past couple of decades -- along the East Coast in 1970 and across the Northwest and Northern Plains in 1979.; This Thursday the moon's shadow will be back for another performance, one of the century's best.; It's unusual for several reasons.
