"Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad event," Drexel stated."I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as part of the firm's settlement with the government, but I look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies," Michael Milken said in a statement.But Milken still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junk bond employees and Drexel clients, and no one is ruling out defections.People involved in Milken's plans for the new firm, International Capital Assets Group, said Milken does not intend to raid Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond division, which he founded and ran until his March indictment.But what isn't clear is whether loyal ex-colleagues will follow the Pied Piper of junk bonds to his new firm _ and how long the venture will last with Milken facing a lengthy jail term.The Drexel official said the provision likely will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, so some contact between the New York investment firm's clients and Milken may occur.
