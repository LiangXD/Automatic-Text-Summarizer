He's had experiences few can match," said Robert Sims, a former Pentagon spokesman who knew Powell when he served as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's military aide.Along with his predecessor as national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, Powell was credited with helping the Reagan White House recover from the Iran-Contra affair.Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to become the nation's top military officer.As well, Powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political finesse with Congress are as essential as toughened battlefield instincts.Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have outweighed his military experience.Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City and raised in the South Bronx.Gen. Colin Powell, tapped as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is widely viewed as an adroit politician and pragmatic commander capable of representing the U.S. military at a time of sweeping change both home and abroad.
