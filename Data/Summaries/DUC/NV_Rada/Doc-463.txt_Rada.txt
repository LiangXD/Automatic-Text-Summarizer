These actions fully show that the British side has closed the door of negotiations between the two sides and is finally taking a road of confrontation with China on the issue of Hong Kong's political system.Then Britain, under all sorts of pressure, agreed to hold talks with China in April last year on the arrangements for elections for 1994/1995 in Hong Kong.Over the past two days, the British side also published a white paper and unilaterally made public the contents of last year's 17 rounds of Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994-1995 elections in Hong Kong.The British side time and again said that Patten's political bill was aimed at promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and completely considered the aspirations of the Hong Kong residents.China holds that as long as the Hong Kong compatriots and the mainland people closely cooperate and completely implement the principle of "one country, two systems", the future of Hong Kong will be bright.Before the Chinese and British sides reach an agreement on the arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the partial electoral bill passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or any other electoral bill possibly yet to be passed by the Legco cannot remain beyond the year 1997.It is known to all that shortly after Patten became Hong Kong governor in 1992, he began to sell his political bill step by step under the pretence of increasing democracy in Hong Kong, in an attempt to change Hong Kong's present political structure and pull the pro-British elements and those who are opposed to China onto the political stage, so as to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity which cannot be controlled by the central government of China after 1997.No matter how far the British side will walk along the road of confrontation with China on the issue of Hong Kong's political system, it absolutely cannot prevent the progress of history.
