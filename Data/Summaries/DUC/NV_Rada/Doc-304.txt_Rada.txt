Judge Thomas, who just turned 43 last week, would be the youngest Supreme Court justice of the past 100 years with the exception of William O. Douglas, who joined the court when he was 40.Judge Thomas is well-liked by colleagues, both at the EEOC, where the new headquarters building is named for him, and at the appeals court.Moreover, Democrats specifically urged the president to consider appointing a minority-group member to fill the vacancy that was created when Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement last Thursday.A number of Senate Democrats, including Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden of Delaware, stressed when Judge Thomas was confirmed for the appeals court that he would face tougher scrutiny if he were nominated for the Supreme Court.Judge Thomas, who has been sitting on the federal appeals court in Washington for just 14 months, won't be confirmed without a fight in the Senate focusing on his inexperience on the bench and his strong opposition to affirmative action.Abortion-rights groups are also likely to be concerned about the fact that Judge Thomas is a Catholic who spent a year in a Missouri seminary in the 1960s pondering the priesthood.WASHINGTON -- By choosing Clarence Thomas, a conservative black federal judge, for the Supreme Court, President Bush may have defused a fierce political battle over the high court's shift to the right.As a child, Judge Thomas said, "I could not dare dream that I would ever see the Supreme Court, not to mention be nominated to it."Women have a right to know whether Judge Thomas is committed to protecting their fundamental rights."As other Supreme Court nominees have done, however, Judge Thomas is likely to go to great lengths to avoid committing himself on abortion, an issue that is expected to come before the court again and again.While liberals will focus on Judge Thomas's legal inexperience, his record on the bench doesn't present them with the sort of target they had with the articulated, sharply conservative legal views of Robert Bork, whose Supreme Court nomination was defeated in 1987.Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said, "With so many constitutional rights and personal liberties at stake, the Senate must make sure Clarence Thomas has demonstrated a commitment to equal opportunity and equal justice under the law. . . .Ricky Silberman, a close friend who is vice chairman of the EEOC and whose husband, Laurence, sits on the appeals court, says: "He is a very simple person who loves to say he was a farm boy and remains a farm boy."In his press conference, Mr. Bush strongly denied the very thought of that, insisting that race wasn't a factor in the selection of Judge Thomas.
