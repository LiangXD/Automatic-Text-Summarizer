Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry and air services.Eurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable without the high-speed rail link."There is in no sense a feeling we must have that link to make the tunnel successful."But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits."There is a danger of not being able to exploit the tunnel to its full potential," says Prof. Christopher Nash, a transport expert at Leeds University in Northern England."There will be no more talk of crisis," says Alastair Morton, chief executive officer of Eurotunnel PLC, the consortium building the cross-channel link.As a result of Thursday's decision, the journey time to London from Paris will be about three hours -- 30 minutes longer than with a high-speed rail link.
