Institute spokesman Ulpiano Trillanes said the Philippine earthquake affected a wide area of Luzon island, including Manila, but apparently caused no serious damage or injuries.Separate strong earthquakes rocked northern Japan and the main Philippine island of Luzon today, swaying buildings and trees but apparently not causing any serious injuries or damage, officials said.Both earthquakes also occurred in quake-prone areas where edges of the earth's crustal plates are thought to rub together, a Central Meteorological Agency official said."It's been some time since we had earthquake activity in that area of Hokkaido, so it's not surprising to have some now caused by a build-up of pressure between the plates," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
