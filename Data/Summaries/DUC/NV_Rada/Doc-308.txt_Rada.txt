We have argued continuously during these years that this argument was false, that the voters had indeed entrusted Ronald Reagan with a mandate (his campaign positions were clear) and that the losing side was trying to overturn the results of these elections.It looks to us as if Clarence Thomas is the first Justice to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court with a popular mandate.But history will note that at the moment Clarence Thomas was about to be destroyed by the old order, the American people came forward and by the millions confirmed his appointment to the Supreme Court.They can't possibly have wanted the sexual harassment charge against Clarence Thomas to go before the entire American population.Washington's reporters, who had already largely broken away from the editorial controls of traditional journalism, even broke away from the congressional staffs and special-interest groups, building the sexual harassment story into a bonfire of personal and political grievances.Now, with Clarence Thomas heading for the Court and the voters going back to their daily lives, what has been learned?They seemed to be demanding a national referendum on sexual harassment, meaning a Senate vote for the accuser, and instead the whole nation showed up and a big majority voted the other way -- to support Clarence Thomas.
