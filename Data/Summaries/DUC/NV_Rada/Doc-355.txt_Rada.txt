Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense.U.S. commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war, though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000.The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S. officials now say, was that they all would have required lifting economic sanctions against Iraq."We looked to the United States, we expected you to have the moral edge," says Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University."I think frankly Saddam is finished, no matter what happens," says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has written extensively about Iraq.President Bush's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait."So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success," said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces.Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley" that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait "imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq."U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over.There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages.Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military.The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster.If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year-long war against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S. and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much of his country's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins.Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi territory as part of a "pincer" movement to trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but insisted, "The purpose isn't to invade Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate."The attack was lightning quick, as allied forces punched through tall sand berms on the border and pushed forward into Iraq and Kuwait.
