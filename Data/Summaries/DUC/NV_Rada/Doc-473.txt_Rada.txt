A more candid union argument holds that increases in the minimum raises wage scales generally, but the truth of that is doubtful too.At any rate, a study commission appointed by Jimmy Carter estimated in a 1981 report that every 10% increase in the minimum wage cost the economy 80,000 to 200,000 entry-level jobs.That's more than a 44% increase.Yet organized labor, which constantly asserts its interest in job creation, has made a strong pitch for the Kennedy-Hawkins "Minimum Wage Restoration Act," a bill that would head the minimum wage upward once more.Since Congress stopped raising the federal minimum wage in 1981, the U.S. economy has generated nine million new jobs at all salary levels.Secretary Brock in June suggested the administration might go along with this scheme if youths are exempted and the indexing plan is dropped.
