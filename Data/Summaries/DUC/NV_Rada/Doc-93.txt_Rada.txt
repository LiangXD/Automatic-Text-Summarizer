Census officials say they are required to count everyone by the U.S. Constitution which does not mention citizenship but only instructs that the House apportionment be based on the "whole number of persons" residing in the various states.Tom Ridge, R-Pa., said the Census Bureau should actually count everyone but that it should develop a method to determine how many people are illegally in the country, and them deduct that number from the figures used for reapportioning Congress.
