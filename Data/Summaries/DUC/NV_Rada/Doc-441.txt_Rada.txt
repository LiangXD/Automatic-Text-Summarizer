Without such aid, the Maize Board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de grace.The Maize Board, the state marketing board, expects a crop of 4m tonnes, though Mr du Toit believes it could be closer to 3m or 3.5m, which would make it the worst harvest in 50 years.Mr JG Wilson of the local agricultural co-operative says maize farmers in the area - one of the largest maize producing regions - have already lost 80 to 100 per cent of their crops.None the less, Pretoria is understood to be contemplating substantial drought aid for farmers: several hundred million rands, or perhaps as much as R1bn (Pounds 200m) over two to three years.
