But even worse, others are being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.I'm here today to explain to the people of Iraq why the United States and the world community has responded the way it has to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.The United Nations has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish the Iraqi people, but as a peaceful means to convince your leadership to withdraw from Kuwait.That decision is in the hands of Saddam Hussein.Here is the text of President Bush's address to the people of Iraq, as released by the White House:In fact, the occupation of Kuwait is helping no one and is now hurting you, the Iraqi people, and countless others of the world's poor.When Iraq returns to the path of peace, when Iraqi troops withdraw from Kuwait, when that country's rightful government is restored, when all foreigners held against their will are released, then, and then alone will the world end the sanctions.I do not believe that you, the people of Iraq, want war.Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and America.Iraq must get out of Kuwait -- for the sake of principle, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the Iraqi people.Because of Iraq's aggression, hundreds of thousands of innocent foreign workers are fleeing Kuwait and Iraq.Saddam Hussein tells you the occupation of Kuwait will benefit the poorer nations of the world.Let me say clearly, there is no way Iraq can win.And the world met Iraq's invasion with a chorus of condemnation, unanimous resolutions in the United Nations.But while those actions have brought us to the brink of conflict, war is not inevitable.Today, two years later, Saddam has invaded and occupied a member of the United Nations and the Arab League.Ultimately, Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait.
