I said that although the Second Amendment has nothing to do with private uses of arms, there is an unenumerated but undeniable right to own a gun.In the same way, the right to own a gun is not disparaged by being licensed or otherwise regulated and controlled.Another letter writer thinks I have confused the issue by calling the duty to serve in the militia a right to serve, but if he will look at the debates in the First Congress he will see that there is no confusion at all, that the authors of the Second Amendment were talking about the right to serve.
