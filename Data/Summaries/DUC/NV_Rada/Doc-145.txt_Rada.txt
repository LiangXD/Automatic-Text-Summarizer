If the funds are used productively, debt service is not a burden in the critical sense that the debtors would be better off if they had not borrowed.This is like saying that banks, building societies, and governments issuing saving certificates are burdened when they pay interest.It is pertinent also that the poorest are low among the priorities of the local rulers.Sir, Mr James Skinner (Letters, April 11) charges me with misuse of statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries.
