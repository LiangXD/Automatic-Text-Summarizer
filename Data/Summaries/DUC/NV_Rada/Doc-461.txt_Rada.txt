Just as he said in his article, the reason is that what he has done since he became governor of Hong Kong has been criticized and condemned not only by China and people of Hong Kong, but also by people in Britain.But for the Hong Kong people, of course the Hong Kong Chinese, what should be put first is certainly that they should be treated as real Chinese people of China rather than a conquered people in a colony, and the first responsibility of Britain is to ensure a smooth return of Hong Kong to China in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration.What is more, "judging from a long-term point of view, our position in China and Asia may, to a great extent, be decided by how we discharge our responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner."This British Hong Kong governor is really more concerned about Hong Kong than the Hong Kong people.To the Chinese people, the following is understandable: Hong Kong was plundered after the Opium War, a war of aggression launched by Britain against China.People will also ask: Why will the position of Britain in China and Asia be decided by how Britain discharges its responsibility in Hong Kong in a dignified manner?The most important point of the article is that Chris Patten was trying hard to explain that all he had done was in the interests of the Hong Kong people.
