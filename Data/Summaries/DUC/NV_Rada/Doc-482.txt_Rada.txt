There are many estimates of the potential employment cost of Labour's minimum wage.A 10 per cent wage increase is predicted to raise relative full-time employment by 25 per cent.A recent study of the effect of extending the mainland minimum wage to Puerto Rico in 1974 found a more dramatic employment effect.International evidence is a better source of clues on the likely effects of a UK minimum wage.Most US studies of the effects of the minimum wage over the past few decades have found a moderately negative impact on employment, mainly among young people.There are many outliers; but the upward sloping 'best-fit' line between the dots indicates a positive, and statistically significant, relationship between higher mandated wage growth and higher employment.
