But Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa said in a television interview that fighting was going on in at least 20 places in Slovenia, and he estimated there were more than 100 dead and wounded on both sides.The nationalist governments of Slovenia and Croatia have been demanding a looser confederation of sovereign republics.JEZERSKO, Yugoslavia -- On Wednesday, the Slovene soldiers manning this border post raised a new flag to mark Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia.Less than two days after Slovenia and Croatia, two of Yugoslavia's six republics, unilaterally seceded from the nation, the federal government in Belgrade mobilized troops to regain control.Politically, the two republics' declarations of independence have been ignored by the rest of the world, which supports a united Yugoslavia.Together, Slovenia, with two million people, and Croatia, with five million, supply nearly two-thirds of Yugoslavia's foreign exchange and about half of the country's gross national product."The first shots that have been fired in Slovenia since after World War II," he said.Here, the drama was watched by several Yugoslavs trying to return to their country from Austria; the cooks, waitresses and a few guests at restaurants on both sides of the border; several tourists who were caught on the Yugoslav side; and a dozen Austrian customs officers and policemen.In Ljubljana, Milan Kucan, Slovenia's president, vowed in a television address that the republic's militia would respond with "all methods" to any aggression against his "independent state."He called on Slovenes in the federal army to desert and join the republic's militia.And they fear losing the economic support of Slovenia and Croatia, the two wealthiest republics.Slovenes watching the action were horrified, as the consequences of their independence grab became clear.
