Few diamond-producing countries dare sell their output outside the organization, and some bold enough to leave have returned because of the difficulty in peddling diamonds alone.The organization buys rough diamonds from De Beers' own mines, which represent 30 percent of world production, and from producers in Tanzania, South Africa, Zaire, Botswana, Namibia, Australia and the Soviet Union."We are as strongly in control of the diamond market as we have been for many years," said Tim Capon, the cartel's director.This is the Central Selling Organization, London-based marketing arm of the De Beers diamond empire, controlled by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of South Africa."This year is going to be a critical one for De Beers," says Diamond Intelligence Briefs, a trade publication.Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, a diamond merchant, became chairman of De Beers in 1929 and five years later formed Diamond Trading Co., the precursor of today's cartel.Oppenheimer, who linked the diamond business with his extensive Anglo American Corp. gold-mining interests, is credited with steering De Beers through the Depression.Jack Lunzer, managing director of IDC Ltd., an independent diamond distributor in London, said De Beers undoubtedly will continue to control the major part of world production, but its marketing arm's profits will fall.Ten times a year, at sales called "sights," the clients are offered a selection of diamonds chosen by the organization and placed in a simple cardboard box.De Beers insists it seeks long-term stability and prosperity for the industry, saying price fluctuations would undermine confidence in the value of diamonds.The organization sells most of the Soviet Union's West-bound diamonds, but the Soviets, the biggest value producer, have been acting more independently and squeezing the cartel's margins, the experts say.
