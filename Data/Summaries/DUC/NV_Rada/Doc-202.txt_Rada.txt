A smaller service tunnel running between them now is being dug.Another is digging from the French coast in what the tunnel builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way in the world."People still question whether the tunnel will be complete in May 1993 and that's ridiculous," says Kathy Watson, co-author of a book on the project.A colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of Dover, pursuing a dream born in Napoleon's time that is coming true at last.With trade barriers among the 12 EEC countries set to fall in 1992, Colin Kirkland, technical director of Eurotunnel's on the British side, says the tunnel will be completed this time.The tunnels are to be completed in 1991, then the railroad tracks will be laid.The tunnel, 80-130 feet below the seabed, was 2 miles into the channel from this end Oct.At its peak, the project will employ about 11,000 workers and 11 tunneling machines.Cars and trucks will drive onto the shuttle trains and be able to stay in their vehicles or stroll about during the 35-minute tunnel passage.
