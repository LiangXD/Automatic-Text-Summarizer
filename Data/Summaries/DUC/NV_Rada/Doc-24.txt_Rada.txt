"I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago," Daley said."I'm the head of this police department, and if this police department is bad, it's because I'm bad as superintendent," Martin said.At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.Daley is filling the remaining two years of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he died in November 1987.
