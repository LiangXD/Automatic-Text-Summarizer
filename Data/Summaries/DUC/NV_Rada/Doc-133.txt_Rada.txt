Patience was its own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday, as the men's and women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take a toll on the runners.The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners.Gural emphatically said it was too hot, "The sun went to work," was how he put it, and he said he experienced tenderness in his liver during the race.Asked if she was ever aware of Yanmin during the race, Konatz laughed.Run as a race within a race was the Pacific Rim Marathon, which consists of teams from invited countries.Wilson and Yanmin won both the Long Beach Marathon and the Pacific Rim race, for total prize money of $9,500 each."I didn't really want to lead all the way," Wilson said.Conditions were excellent at the start of the race, which had its largest-ever field of 4,021 entrants.Two Soviet runners -- Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva -- who had run side-by-side in third and fourth place throughout the race, faded.The weather for the first 1 1/2 hours was cloudy and cool.Rex Wilson of New Zealand patiently waited for the lead pack to sort itself out, took the lead at 10 miles and rolled to a victory in 2 hours 12 minutes 27 seconds, a course record."I hate the marathon," Wilson, 28, said, sounding quite sensible.As happened in the men's race, the runners in the lead pack ebbed and eventually faded.
