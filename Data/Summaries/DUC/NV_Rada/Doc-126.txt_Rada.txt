-- More than 90% of police chiefs and sheriffs surveyed agree that criminals are not affected by a ban on any type of firearm, while more than 70% oppose "waiting periods" for the same reason. -- A prisoner survey conducted by James D. Wright et al. found that unarmed felons listed tougher penalties for using a gun as an important reason for not arming themselves. -- 75%-80% of U.S. violent crimes are committed by career criminals, many on some form of conditional or early release (30%-35% of career criminals are rearrested with previous criminal charges still pending). -- Gary Kleck found that using a gun for protection from violent crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- reduces the likelihood that the crime will be completed and that intended victims will be injured.Mr. Gartner has now made it abundantly clear that his goal is the elimination of handguns from our society.Clearly, the issue at hand is not gun control but, rather, crime control.As evidenced by New York City and Washington, which have the nation's strictest gun-control laws and virtually ban the ownership of handguns by law-abiding citizens, Mr. Gartner's placebo doesn't work because it ignores the root causes of suicide and crime.James Forbes Atlanta --- It is refreshing to read the actual motives of those who claim they simply want a waiting period for the purchase of a handgun.The NRA has not acted prudently and is alienating the support and respect of many legislators, police departments and its members.
