"The problem with Type II diabetics is not that they don't make enough insulin; they don't respond to the insulin," DeFronzo said."We don't know why, when they get diabetes, they have a more severe form of the disease _ whether it's a biological difference or is it that they are not getting as good medical care.Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes, but it is most prevalent among minorities, especially Native Americans, blacks and Hispanics.The study is in its follow-up stage, to see if diagnosed diabetes patients have changed their lifestyle and have sought medical care.Researchers believe that poor Hispanics' diets of cheap, processed foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention _ either due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors _ increases their risk of acquiring diabetes."My mother has diabetes and they tell me I might have diabetes, too, but I don't know too much about it.An epidemiologist at the center, Dr. Michael Stern, has devoted 10 years to studying Hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study of Type II diabetes.San Antonio, the nation's ninth largest city, with a population that is 50 percent Hispanic, is becoming the base for diabetes studies.
