White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that direct solicitation of firms to provide such planes would not be improper, although Sununu aides deny that he asked directly for the planes.; The car controversy has created new ripples among Republicans who question whether Sununu recognizes that repeated questions about his ethics reflect poorly on Bush, who vowed during his campaign to bring a higher ethical standard to his administration and fight even the appearance of impropriety among aides.; One administration source, echoing comments by many Republicans outside the administration, said Tuesday that Sununu "has a total blind spot on the issue of ethics and public service."; While Fitzwater has defended the legality of using the car and corporate jets, he would not offer an opinion on perceptions of impropriety.; "I can't make a judgment," he said, adding, "I don't know what happened" in connection with the jets.It was Sununu's first appearance on a network program since revelations in April about his extensive use of government planes for activities ranging from visiting his dentist to skiing to trips to his home state of New Hampshire.; On Sunday, Sununu gave the same explanation for using the government car that he had offered for using government planes -- that he must be able to communicate instantly with the White House in the interest of national security.; Sununu has been unable to fly on government planes for personal business since Bush instituted new travel rules after the April controversy.; Sununu since has asked sponsors of political events at which he is to speak to obtain corporate jets to take him to and from Washington.
