"If he's eligible to compete, to me, Ben Johnson is an attraction," said Ray Lumpp, meet director for the indoor meet at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J..The IAAF voted last September to adopt the controversial "Ben Johnson Rule" allowing the IAAF Council to decertify an athlete's records, titles and results if he or she later is shown to have used a banned substance before those performances.Futerman limits Johnson's contact with the media, saying "Ben has said all he has to say.It has been two years since Johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics.I can't say that it's wrong, especially when deep down I know Johnson's not the only one who's ever taken drugs."Some meet directors report concern that longtime sponsors will be reluctant to be associated with a meet that has Johnson as its marquee athlete, given Johnson's former association with anabolic steroids.Johnson reportedly will be paid $10,000 (Canadian) for the meet in Hamilton, a figure that has caused some jealousy among his peers."Once he returns to the sport, and if he returns a winner, all is forgiven," said Paul Gaines, assistant meet director for the Hamilton Spectator Indoor Games, the Canadian meet to be held Jan.18 meet, saying Johnson will receive the highest appearance fee Franken has ever paid -- $30,000, compared to the $23,000 Franken paid Carl Lewis."I want to take back the titles and the records I have been deprived of," the Associated Press quoted Johnson as saying.Whether he is worth as much after six meets, I don't know.If the public will pay to watch Johnson is another question."There has been damage to the sport and people want to blame Ben personally for that damage," Gaines said.Lumpp, who traditionally has one of the largest budgets in North America, said resentment is a problem faced every season by meet directors.The question remains, is Ben Johnson capable of running at that brilliant level again?"I think honestly, you have to figure that a lot of it is curiosity," Franken said.Similarly, Johnson was erased from track and field's record books.Will he be the same Johnson?One thing that may not happen is a much-discussed lucrative match race between Johnson and Lewis.Many of those around Johnson have changed, too.Hamilton promoter Gaines has heard it before, and makes no apology for paying Johnson more than other athletes."It's kind of perplexing, isn't it?," Kern said.BIG MONEY Promoters of indoor meets this season doubt that Johnson will regain his records, but they hope that fans will turn out in huge numbers to watch him try.Howard Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York has an interest in Johnson, but perhaps not the budget.Johnson gave an in-depth interview to the German magazine, Sport, but only after being paid."There is a lot of interest in seeing whether this fellow is a truly great runner or if he is what Carl Lewis said he is, a fair runner who got there by taking drugs," Schmertz said.What happened to Johnson after his positive test in Seoul is similar to what used to happen to famous East Europeans after defection.A NEW CAST Johnson, 28, has passed at least four drug tests during his suspension."I'd like to have Ben Johnson regardless of how he runs.Even though Johnson admitted to having taken drugs since 1981, the rule carries a six-year statue of limitations.Al Franken, promoter of the Sunkist Invitational, is close to signing Johnson for his Jan.Johnson was as before, shy and yet brimming with confidence.
