LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one of the most brutal police forces in the country: now he is under attack for fuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor black neighbourhoods.In March, Mr Gates strongly defended the detective who had led an investigation 17 years earlier into the killing of an off-duty Los Angeles police officer, although a judge had just released the two men wrongfully convicted, calling police conduct 'reprehensible' and urging an immediate investigation of the 'sordid record'.A high-ranking commission appointed after the beating, under the chairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher, a lawyer and former deputy secretary of state, concluded that the Los Angeles police department got results, in terms of arrests, but had developed a 'siege mentality that alienates the officer from the community'.
