CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with Beijing.The Hong Kong government responded to China's latest attack by declaring that Beijing was in breach of both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future and the 1990 Basic Law - the colony's post-1997 constitution - drafted by Beijing.The challenge was immediately rejected by the Hong Kong government, which accused China of violating Anglo-Chinese agreements and its own law for Hong Kong which comes into force after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in June 1997.
