Critics say the environmental provisions will make science more expensive in Antarctica, already the costliest research site apart from outer space."We've been living on a tripod-geopolitics, future uses of Antarctica and research," says Guy Guthridge, an NSF Antarctic spokesman.Stanislaw Rakusa-Suszczewski, who runs the Polish Antarctic program, says he has tried to persuade Hungary and Czechoslovakia to chip in enough money to make Arctowski a "post-Communist country" base, but to no avail.Of the $193 million the U.S. plans to spend this fiscal year in Antarctica, only $22 million is budgeted for science.This year, after a budget battle, more money was appropriated for U.S. Antarctica research, partly by redirecting funds earmarked for housing for the poor.The countries with the strongest commitment to Antarctica may turn out to be the ones that are tied to the continent by nationalism, not science.
