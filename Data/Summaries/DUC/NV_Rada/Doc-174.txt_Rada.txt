There are hundreds of beaches all over the sound that are still oiled, and the oil is slowly bleeding out.Those numbers alone make the Valdez spill the most lethal ever, but scientists say the actual death count is much higher, estimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank from sight or drifted out to sea.The state sued, claiming the company was negligent in responding to the spill, only to be countersued by Exxon, which claimed state officials hindered the use of chemical dispersants that could have broken up large quantities of oil early on.They say observers flying over the sound still report 15 to 20 oil sheens bleeding off beaches daily."Oil," he says.But when Exxon suspended its $2 billion cleanup in mid-September, it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the oil spilled, state officials estimate.From a helicopter, the wave-washed beach looks as if the worst oil spill in U.S. history had never touched it.Exxon officials, meanwhile, say their winter monitoring of 64 sites shows wind and waves have scoured away, on average, more than half the surface oil left in September, and up to 80 percent of the buried oil.That leaves 50 percent to 75 percent of the oil in the water, on the ocean bottom or on beaches.
