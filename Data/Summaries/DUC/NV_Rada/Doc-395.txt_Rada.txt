Among the guests were a number of children from the fourth-grade class Sharon Rogers taught at the La Jolla Country Day School.She was fired by administrators of the exclusive La Jolla Country Day School, who feared that her presence posed a security threat to the children.Speaking from the deck of the Vincennes, Rogers paid special tribute to his wife, Sharon, who narrowly escaped death in March when a suspected terrorist bomb destroyed her van as she was driving to her teaching job at an exclusive private school in La Jolla.Rogers was presented with a letter saying that while on duty in the Persian Gulf, his "tactical skills and calm direction enabled his crew to successfully engage seven heavily armed high-speed Iranian surface craft" attacking the Vincennes in "confined and confused waters."When I arrived, she was most concerned, as her lesson plans were in flames and she was going to be late for school."Will C. Rogers III was awarded the Legion of Merit, a top military honor, on Saturday as he stepped down from command of the Vincennes.
