I represented the suspect.; The offending officer's police report indicated that the suspect's injuries were due to a fall from his bike and that he appeared unconscious, although he had also struggled against being handcuffed.; There is no mention of police brutality.Both officers smirked and laughed.; The offending officer was later arrested and prosecuted by the district attorney.; What if there had not been four citizens who observed the brutal beating of my client?; One of the problems in monitoring police brutality is that almost all victims of police abuse have themselves committed some kind of law violation.This makes their complaints difficult to sustain.; But there is another problem: a police discipline system that is cloaked in secrecy.; San Jose Police Chief Joseph MacNamara recently referred to the Los Angeles incident as "disgusting brutality" and pointed out that the disturbing aspect was the failure of leadership and the code of silence.Although the penal code makes the findings of investigations confidential, investigations themselves can be conducted by the public and can be open to the public.; Complaints of police brutality should be handled in an open process that is neutral and thorough.He correctly notes that it is important for police credibility that police chiefs break the code of silence and repudiate such acts and attitudes.; Unfortunately, MacNamara also believes that San Jose does not need a citizens' review board.
