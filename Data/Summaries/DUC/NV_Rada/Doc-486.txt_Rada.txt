In all, some 3,800 species of plant and animal life are being invited to the party, and as in the original Eden, snakes.The oxygen is breathed in by humans and animals who breathe out carbon dioxide which is breathed in by the plants and used in photosynthesis which produces more oxygen.So Dr. Tony Burgess of the University of Arizona patterned the deserts after those of Baja California where the cactus and other plants have learned to live with ocean fog.Scientists had to be sure there would be that many in bloom every day of the year.Plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands in Biosphere II.In the beginning, or near it, they suggested that oxygen was sparse and so most of the early creatures were anaerobic bacteria that didn't need oxygen.It is the professional nature of engineers and architects to keep the outside world out.Probably the first to consider Earth and its environment as a biosphere was a Soviet scientist, V.I. Vernadsky in 1926.Biosphere II is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural proclivity of water.The water-laden air then is drawn and climbs the mountain where natural cooling and condensing coils bring it down as rain and dew to feed the stream again.In these areas, where well-defined habitats change, scientists hope to learn how desert encroaches on more productive areas, what happens when fresh water turns brackish, what goes on when climates change.
