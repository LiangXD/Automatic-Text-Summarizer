The advantage of allowing state or regional differences in minimum-wage levels is that the appropriate minimum wage for Connecticut might force massive layoffs in Texas.Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05.Moreover, the quoted minimum wage for a state is often deceptive.California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages.Some states offer what is, in reality, a menu of minimum wages rather than a single minimum.Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living.Furthermore, the District of Columbia, like many states, has a subminimum, or "training" wage, of $3.35 for employees in some job categories who are under age 18.
