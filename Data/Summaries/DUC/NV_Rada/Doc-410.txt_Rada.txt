Wednesday's fire occurred as the Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off Isla Mujeres, a Mexican island north of the tourist resort Cancun in the Yucatan peninsula, the Coast Guard said.An engine room fire Wednesday disabled a cruise ship off the Mexican coast, but the crew extinguished the blaze and the ship with 715 people aboard was towed to port.A second person who suffered a spinal cord injury was also evacuated with the heart attack victim, but Diaz said that injury also was apparently not related to the fire.
