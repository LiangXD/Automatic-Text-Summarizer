Hurricanes are classified by the Saffir-Simpson scale, the fiercest a No.Gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the '50s and '60s, because of an apparent break in the periodic West African drought."The probability of more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s," says meteorologist William M. Gray of Colorado State University, who analyzes hurricane patterns.The strongest recorded storm on Earth, Zimmer says, was 1979 Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars.The threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded, says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Officially a 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it "may be a borderline 5," says meteorologist Mark Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami."If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will," Emanuel explains.Hurricanes are like huge, self-sustaining heat engines spinning across the sea.5 hurricanes have struck the United States with full force, the 1935 Labor Day storm that ravaged the Florida Keys and 1969's Camille, which slammed ashore at Mississippi and Louisiana.
