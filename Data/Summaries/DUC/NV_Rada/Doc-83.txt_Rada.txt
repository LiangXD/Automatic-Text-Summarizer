Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today.Another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB bacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone to tuberculosis.This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.The research found that when living conditions are identical, black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria.About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the United States, resulting in 1,700 deaths."We found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks," said Dr. William W. Stead.By contrast, blacks are genetically more resistant than whites to malaria, which is common in Africa.
