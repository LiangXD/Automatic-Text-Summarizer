An experimental cancer drug that works after a single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study.Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it "may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia."The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA _ has produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia patients treated, and none has relapsed so far.
