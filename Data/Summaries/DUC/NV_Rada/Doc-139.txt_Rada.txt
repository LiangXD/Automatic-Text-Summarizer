Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.He says the bank's main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a 'balanced relationship between government and the market' in developing countries.'The Brady plan is enough,' says Mr Williamson, if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt.Few in Washington now doubt that the bank is needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the Middle East, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems: Grinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bn people live on less than Dollars 1 a day.The challenge for Mr Preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital.'The morale of staff is lousy,' says Mr Charles Flickner, a senior analyst on the Senate Budget Committee and close observer of the bank.This is both because countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the bank's policies were sometimes misguided.Advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sector are surely not arguing for public subsidies for Third World entrepreneurs; but if subsidies are ruled out, why should the bank's judgment of market risk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west?Mr Preston's first challenge, says Mr Mistry, will be to wrest control of the bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi; his second, to prune legions of 'useless advisers' and install managers with real-world experience.Development economists, meanwhile, are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World Development Report and focus more on poverty alleviation.According to Mr Lawrence Summers, the bank's chief economist, net transfers over the next five years will be about Dollars 2 per person in the developing world compared with Dollars 9 (in current prices) in the late 1970s.The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector.As incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank's strategies for promoting development.The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach strict political conditions to its loans.That is the vexing question facing Mr Lewis Preston, the former chairman of J P Morgan, the New York bank, who takes over as president of the World Bank this September.The maturing of bank programmes and the failure to expand lending much in the 1980s has led to a marked shrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries.'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,' concludes Mr Richard Feinberg, director of the Overseas Development Council in Washington.
