"Every census since the Constitution was created has counted all residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens," observed Rep."Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted" in the census, responded Ridge.That has yet to be decided, but possibilities include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last state where he or she lived for at least six months.Tom Ridge, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 million to run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year, including $800 million to take the census.The problem has been in deciding which states may count these people as residents.
