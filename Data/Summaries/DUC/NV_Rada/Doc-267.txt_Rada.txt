LIMA -- On June 4, I was among a group of journalists who were told that the war against the Shining Path ("Sendero Luminoso") guerrillas had almost been won.Nevertheless, it was a very important and unexpected police coup against the Shining Path -- one that probably could have brought dramatic results if President Alan Garcia had not decided to make public the operation so soon after the first police intervention, in order to score a quick propaganda gain.This is only wishful thinking, according to Mr. Merino: "If President Fujimori thinks he'll finish the war through those 'pacification' policies, it will be like riding into battle with no better dress or weapons than a tuxedo."At first, he tried a liberal approach, looking for a dialogue with the fanatical Shining Path, and sending scores of young professionals to the emergency areas to attack what he said were the "root causes" of the insurgency.The Shining Path went to war in 1980, on the same day Peru was holding general elections after 12 years of a military dictatorship.Among Shining Path watchers ("Senderlogos") there is strong disagreement on fundamentals: Is the Shining Path getting stronger or weaker?He also feels that the Shining Path is weakened, and that an important Shining Path faction would be willing to engage in peace talks.Midpoint during his term, Mr. Garcia lost all hope of defeating the Shining Path, and decided just to coexist with it, says Rafael Merino, a respected analyst on security matters.According to Francisco Loayza, Mr. Fujimori's adviser on internal-security matters, military actions against the Shining Path should be subordinated to economic-development initiatives.But dialogue was disdainfully rejected: Dozens of these professionals were assassinated, and the armed forces slowed down their actions, while the rebels made largely unimpeded progress.
