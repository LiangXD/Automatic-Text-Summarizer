The point at issue in Senate debate on a new immigration bill was whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will reallocate House seats among states after the 1990 census.Shelby's amendment says only that the secretary is to "make such adjustments in total population figures as may be necessary, using such methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and appropriate" to keep illegal aliens from being counted in congressional reapportionment.The Constitution itself says the apportionment of the House is to be determined on the basis of "the whole number of free persons," excluding Indians and counting every five slaves as three persons.He said it is unfair to count illegal aliens in reapportionment.That was amended after the Civil War to say that the apportionment of House seats will be based on "the whole number of persons in each state."Opponents of the amendment said that showed the authors of both documents wanted everybody counted for purposes of apportionment.Richard Shelby, D-Ala., proposed, and won, the immigration bill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the redistricting process.The Senate has passed an immigration bill including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the redistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear Congress before the next year's national head count.
