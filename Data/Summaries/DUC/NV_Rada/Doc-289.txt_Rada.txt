The public, and even public officials, remain largely unaware that Japan's scientists are debating whether prediction is impossible or merely difficult.Japan's prediction research activities, primarily overseen by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, are subject to no such review.Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.6m) a year monitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research.The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock in the hope that six experts, to be summoned at a moment's notice, will recognise unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake.The evidence is that significant strain has accumulated along the fault since the region's last big earthquake.Japan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists throughout the world were optimistic about prediction.Some 160km west of Tokyo in Japan's coastal Tokai region is what may be the world's most dense array of geophysical instruments.He says if they knew what precursory phenomena occurred the last time that section of the fault slipped, in 1854, they would be able to predict the next earthquake.Japan has had numerous killer quakes outside the Tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off the coast of Hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives.In Japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the Tokai area was overdue for a significant quake.
