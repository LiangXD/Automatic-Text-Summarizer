"Mad cow" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry.The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the "mad cow" scare.Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently.On Friday, West Germany joined France in a ban on British beef imports, citing health fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).Concern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject Topic A in the pubs and press of Britain, and has put a serious crimp in domestic beef sales."BSE has been around for six or seven years," said David Lewis of the Meat and Livestock Commission.Some regulations were enacted to fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne said her family was still eating British beef.No one is certain what causes the disease, which affects the cow's brain.
