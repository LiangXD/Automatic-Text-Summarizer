Joan became the 10th named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season when top winds passed 39 mph on Oct."Joan is one of a kind," said Jim Gross, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center.Hurricane Joan's 80 mph winds churned across the open Caribbean today on an unusual southern path that has forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible landfall.Also, he said hurricanes are often sapped of strength in the far southern Caribbean due to trade winds that push colder deep-ocean water to the surface, said Gross.
