If the wage is boosted, warns Anne Papa, a National Restaurant Association official, "employers will be forced to cut back on their work forces."Employers say they'd have to raise wages for other workers, and costs would inevitably be passed on to the consumer.Republicans have warned they may counter the push to expand the minimum wage with a long-sought subminimum wage for teens, but an administration official says no decision has yet been made on its position on an increase.Nearly 3.5 million hourly workers earn the minimum wage, according to the Labor Department, but it's expected that any increase would also benefit the nearly 1.5 million workers who are paid below the minimum and others who earn slightly above the minimum.The historical goal has been a minimum wage equal to half the average wage for non-supervisory private workers, which is currently $8.88 an hour.The labor federation has made the issue a legislative priority, arguing that an increase is long overdue.What's less certain is the shape the bill will finally take, and whether a veto is inevitable from a president who once said the minimum wage "has caused more misery and unemployment than anything else since the Great Depression.""It is not the head of the household who is earning minimum wage," he says.Augustus Hawkins (D., Calif.), who head the Senate and House Labor committees, are expected to introduce legislation to increase the minimum wage from its current rate of $3.35 an hour to about $4.65 hourly over three years, with future automatic annual adjustments.But pressure is building among Democrats in a Congress they now control to raise the wage, which was last increased six years ago.He asserts that the inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage is now at the lowest level in 33 years.Hawkins: "The cost of living has gone up tremendously since the minimum wage was last raised."If we want to support the work ethic, we have to give people a living wage," says Mr. Levitan, who directs George Washington University's Center for Social Policy Studies."The minimum wage simply has not kept up with rising living standards and rising median wages," adds Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank.Now, someone working full-time at the minimum wage earns $6,968 a year, or $1,773 less than the 1986 poverty threshold of $8,741 for a family of three.
