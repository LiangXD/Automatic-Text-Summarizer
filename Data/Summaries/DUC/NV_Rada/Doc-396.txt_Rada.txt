He did not mention any figure for the compensation sought but said the group would be guided by the amount of compensation the Iraqi government paid the families of American sailors killed in an Iraqi air strike on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf on May 16, 1987.The jetliner was on a commercial flight from the Iranian city of Bandar Abbas, where a large air base is located, to Dubai in the southern United Arab Emirates.Ghafoor said the complaint charged that the radar equipment indicated the aircraft approaching the Vincennes was an F-14, diving in an attack mode at an altitude of 4,000 feet, rather than the Iran Air flight, which was climbing.
