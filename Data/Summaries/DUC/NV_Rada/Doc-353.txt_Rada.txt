"A chance to save his country," he replied.; Shortly after Bush issued the allied ultimatum, a Soviet spokesman in Moscow announced a new six-point set of provisions he said were agreed to by Aziz for a withdrawal from Kuwait.; The provisions include Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait within 21 days of a cease-fire and supervision of the withdrawal by the United Nations, Vitaly Ignatenko said.; In his initial statement, Ignatenko made no reference to Bush's ultimatum.; Ignatenko told the hastily called news conference that Soviet officials and Aziz had come up with a "number of new provisions" on the peace proposal first set forth Thursday night.; Ignatenko said the plan had been passed on to Baghdad and that a final response to it from the Iraqi leadership was anticipated.; Asked about the response of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to Bush's ultimatum, Ignatenko said, "It's the proposal just outlined."; Among the requirements for Iraq, said Fitzwater, was that withdrawal from Kuwait City must be complete within 48 hours and from the country of Kuwait in one week.; Iraq also must release all prisoners of war and third-country civilians within 48 hours and remove booby traps and mines from Kuwait.; Fitzwater's list did not touch on the issue of war reparations, or discuss what military equipment, if any, the Iraqis would be forbidden to take back to Iraq with them.; Bush's statement was his first public response to a Soviet-brokered peace plan -- an effort the president said he appreciated, even while he declared that it attached unacceptable conditions on an Iraqi withdrawal.; Bush said he had consulted with Operation Desert Storm coalition leaders and they had agreed to the demands for Iraq's withdrawal.; "We must hear publicly and authoritatively his acceptance of these terms," Bush said.He accused Saddam of launching a "scorched earth policy" in Kuwait by setting fires in the oil fields.; "The time has come to make public with specificity just exactly what is required of Iraq if a ground war is to be avoided," Bush said.; Bush said Saddam "risks subjecting the Iraqi people to further hardship unless the Iraqi government complies fully" with the demands.; At the Pentagon, a senior military official said the diplomatic activity was not derailing the allied war plans.; "Desert Storm continues to swirl on, regardless," the official said.
