The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who dominate Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region.But here in the jungle-cloaked Upper Huallaga Valley, the world's largest source of coca leaf, the Shining Path _ "Sendero Luminoso" in Spanish _ enjoys the support of tens of thousands of farmers because the rebels protect them against a U.S.-funded coca eradication program."What I've heard is that if you want to be named a teacher in the valley," said Feeley, "it's three months salary as payment."If the Shining Path has the image of an organization that's fighting corruption in a very corrupt place, that's going to win them some points," Feeley said.The Shining Path has been quick to kill local officials they deemed to be corrupt, according to residents of the valley."People have had to discipline themselves," said Raul Aranda, an agronomist in Tingo Maria, explaining the effects of "revolutionary justice.""Why do you think people have joined the Shining Path?In a nation where economic chaos reigns and few laws are respected, the Shining Path is setting down clear rules and making them stick.In a rare conversation with reporters, a Shining Path political officer, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, gave an example of the kind of law the guerrillas have laid down: "Do not steal so much as a needle or thread and return what you borrow."
