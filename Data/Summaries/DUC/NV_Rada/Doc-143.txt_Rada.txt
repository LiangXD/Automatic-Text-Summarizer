On the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as Bank of Boston decided Monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible.Along with $330 million in such loans previously put on non-accrual, Bank of Boston has now either charged off, or put on non-accrual, all of its $1 billion loans to heavily indebted developing countries.Bank of Boston also placed on non-accrual $470 million in loans to less-developed countries that are unrelated to trade.For instance, if Manufacturers Hanover Corp. imitated Bank of Boston's action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, Keefe Bruyette estimates.When a loan is placed on non-accrual, a bank only credits interest it actually receives, and doesn't automatically accrue interest due.Bank of Boston Corp.'s decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions, bankers and analysts say.The reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like Bank of Boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities, bank analysts said.Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on whether it might follow Bank of Boston's action."I wouldn't be surprised if some of the medium-sized regionals decided to follow," said Cheryl Swaim, an analyst and vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. In Boston, there were rumors Bank of New England might announce a similar move, but a company spokesman said "reserve levels are appropriate."Bank of Boston announced Monday that it was writing off $200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the Third World on a non-accrual basis.Continental wouldn't comment yesterday on Bank of Boston's action.
