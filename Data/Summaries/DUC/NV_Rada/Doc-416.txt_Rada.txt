Things may go OK under ideal circumstances, but accidents don't happen under ideal circumstances."; Pollock fears that Congress, the Coast Guard and the International Maritime Organization are not moving fast enough to mandate safeguards, despite 176 deaths last year in an arsonist's fire on the Scandinavian Star ferry in Denmark, and the dramatic images of the cruise ship Oceanos, which sank off South Africa early in August, fortunately without loss of life.; Safety experts are primarily concerned with three issues: fire protection, particularly in the big atria of new cruise ships, the ability of crew members to give safety instructions in a language that passengers understand, and the aging of the world fleet of cruise ships.; American passengers frequently assume that any ship they board in a U.S. port has met all Coast Guard safety requirements, a notion reinforced by "Coast Guard approved" labels on most life jackets, and fire systems on smaller boats and domestic ferries.; In fact, the Coast Guard gives four inspections a year to ships that dock in the United States, but when the vessel is registered in another country, the Coast Guard only makes sure the ship provides whatever is required by international Safety of Life at Sea regulations: twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers and life jackets for 125 percent of capacity, with the equipment in good condition.; Once a year, the Coast Guard observes an evacuation drill.Roger Kohn, information officer for the maritime organization in London, said the loss of the Oceanos "tended to confirm a general feeling that something must be done."; John T. Estes, president of the International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the owners of most of the ocean-going cruise vessels, said that his organization favored all the proposed new rules, but not the proposed effective dates.; When the safety committee met in May, it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations beyond 1994 for new ships, possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service of vessels that cannot meet the new rules.; Estes said that accounting for the lead time required for ship design, his organization favors 1996 for enforcing the rules on new construction and major reconstruction.; The 15 major cruise ships that call in New York have passed inspections without difficulty, according to Comdr."The average age of ships today is 16 years, which is already fairly elderly in shipping terms and old ships need more maintenance and repair," he said in a statement last month.; In May, the safety committee of the International Maritime Organization met in London to begin amending the Safety of Life at Sea rules.; The proposed amendments, which are supported by the majority of the member countries, require that new ships' atriums have smoke-detection systems, smoke-exhaust systems, two means of escape and an automatic sprinkler system.; The committee also discussed a phase-out of the grandfather rules.
