In the countryside beyond Dieppe, a typical Norman house, restored and including most of the furniture and a cottage, is for sale for Pounds 125,000 from Domus Abroad.At the moment, agents report more inquiries, but the markets in both countries are still quiet and prices low, especially in France.Prices have stopped falling in northern France and hopes are high that the tunnel, motorways and new railways will resuscitate the region.Outside Le Touquet, A House in France offers a chateau complete with fortification wall and tunnels for FFr1.3m.It has good shops - including the Philippe Olivier cheese shop - and restaurants.The British are mainly looking for houses, rather than apartments, although French and Dutch buyers are also in the market.Once the tunnel is open, said Parry, industry will be attracted to the area and people will move in.For example, a glorious, repossessed abbey with five acres in Tortefontaine, with a 12th century hall and many outbuildings, is on sale at around FFr750,000 (Pounds 86,000) from agents Latitudes or L'Abri-tanique.A small, partly-restored farmhouse near Montreuil can be bought for FFr135,000 from A House in France.The value in France is formidable.Latitudes has on its books an 18th century town house with internal courtyard for FFr1.3m, a snip when you think what you would pay in Paris.
