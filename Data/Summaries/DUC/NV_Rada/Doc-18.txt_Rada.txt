Don Jackson, said he set up the self-styled "sting" in Long Beach to expose alleged police racism in the Los Angeles area.The City Council today asked county prosecutors to investigate the conduct of a white policeman who was secretly filmed while he pushed an off-duty black policeman through a plate-glass window.Jackson said he chose Long Beach police because of complaints to the Police Misconduct Lawyer's Referral Service of Los Angeles.But Jackson's boss said the black officer was looking for trouble."I submit that if Mr. Jackson had stayed in the vehicle, as did the driver, this incident would not have occurred," Hawthorne Police Chief Kenneth R. Stonebraker said at a news conference Monday."The officer simply used violence," Jackson said Monday."I'm deeply concerned since it strikes me as a period when police violence and excessive force is rampant," said Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Los Angeles chapter.The 30-year-old Jackson, who has been on a stress-related disability leave from his Hawthorne job for 22 months, contends the incident is typical of a pattern of racism by white officers in the Los Angeles area.Since the incident apparently was timed by Jackson to coincide with the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. the confrontation should be considered "nothing short of timed sensationalism at the risk of serious injury to all of the parties involved," Stonebraker said.
