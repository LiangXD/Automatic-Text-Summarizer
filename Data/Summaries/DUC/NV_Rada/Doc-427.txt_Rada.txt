They said also that the price the insiders received for their stock was slightly below prevailing market prices. </P> <P> And any allegations of boosting stock prices to get money out of the employee stock ownership plan through the sales, they said, fall flat because most of such stock purchases occurred in 1985, long before the allegedly fraudulent transactions occurred. </P> <P> Example Cited </P> <P> One example of how Lincoln conducted its business, according to government regulators, is a loan it made to Ernest C. Garcia, a Phoenix-area developer. </P> <P> Early in 1987, Garcia approached Lincoln to see if he could borrow money to buy the remaining stock in a company in which he already held a 20% interest.They concluded that Keating was handling Lincoln in an unsafe and unsound manner. </P> <P> In particular, examiners reported that Lincoln had made a substantial number of loans without proper appraisals, without verification of borrowers' credit and even, in some cases, without a loan application. </P> <P> To a large extent, the examiners said in their reports, it appeared that Lincoln was making bogus loans in an effort to get around the new restrictions on direct investments in real estate and to record profits that it had not really earned. </P> <P> Many major loans were made to "straw" buyers: people who bought properties with Lincoln funds on favorable terms and who never intended to repay the loans, thus leaving the savings and loan in control of the properties, the regulatory reports allege. </P> <P> The examiners said that, after making the loans, Lincoln claimed as profits the up-front fees and interest such loans normally generate.In 1979, Lindner and Keating consented to a Securities and Exchange Commission order prohibiting them from fraudulently diverting corporate assets to their personal use. </P> <P> By the early 1980s, Keating -- riding the tide of explosive growth in the Sun Belt -- had built the former Lindner construction firm, renamed American Continental Corp., into one of the nation's 10 biggest home builders. </P> <P> Moreover, he -- like others -- had noticed a new opportunity: Congress, trying to rescue a savings and loan industry saddled with traditional low-rate, long-term home mortgage loans in an era of soaring interest rates, was dismantling the web of federal regulations that had always circumscribed the industry. </P> <P> Under deregulation, banks and S&amp;Ls were allowed to place a part of their assets in direct investments such as ownership interests in real estate projects and other ventures, instead of just making loans on which they would collect interest.The Phoenician opened in late 1988, and, although it is generating tremendous income -- $4.3 million last month alone -- it is not generating enough to pay off its construction debt, regulators claim. </P> <P> "Lincoln never was a viable institution under Keating," said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va.-based consultant to the savings and loan industry. </P> <P> Last week, government regulators seized control of the Phoenician and another Lincoln property, the Crescent Hotel in Phoenix, ousting Keating and as many as 30 of his associates from management of the lodges. </P> <P> Seizure Occurs </P> <P> The government finally seized Lincoln on April 14, 1989, declaring that it was being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner and that Keating and his executives were dissipating its assets. </P> <P> The day before Lincoln was seized, American Continental filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix.In 1983, the state allowed thrifts to put 100% of their money into direct investments. </P> <P> From his headquarters in Phoenix, Keating spotted a California thrift that seemed ideal for his expanding purposes. </P> <P> Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan was an Orange County thrift that had experienced losses in the early 1980s, but it had returned to profitability by the end of 1983.The stock sales were made to American Continental's employee stock ownership plan, which obtained loans guaranteed by Lincoln to acquire the shares. </P> <P> Lincoln executives said they did not misuse the tax-sharing arrangement. </P> <P> The executives contend the transactions that generated the profits were legitimate and that Lincoln owed taxes, although they acknowledged that the taxes might not have been due immediately. </P> <P> And, although Lincoln owed the taxes as a separate entity, they said, American Continental could use $250 million in tax credits it had accumulated itself to offset any profits on a consolidated basis that it or its subsidiaries made.Lincoln executives agreed to make the loan, regulators allege, but there was a condition. </P> <P> According to the government's racketeering lawsuit, the following events occurred: </P> <P> As a condition of lending him the money he wanted, Lincoln asked Garcia to buy 1,000 acres of land owned by a Lincoln subsidiary for $14 million.Instead, American Continental collected money from all its subsidiaries, then filed a consolidated tax return and made tax payments to the IRS on their behalf. </P> <P> Over a period of a little more than two years, Lincoln made $95 million in tax-sharing payments to its parent company, ostensibly to cover taxes on profits it had earned. </P> <P> But the government alleges in its racketeering lawsuit and other documents that Lincoln did not owe $95 million in taxes at the time and that American Continental never paid any of that money to the IRS. </P> <P> Keating and his subordinates engaged in a series of sham transactions designed to create the appearance of higher profits, and thus higher tax obligations, as a device for siphoning money out of Lincoln and moving it to American Continental, which kept the extra funds, according to federal investigators. </P> <P> Higher profits also boosted American Continental's stock price.They said that Garcia, for instance, obtained a $30-million line of credit and that the $20.2 million he borrowed on the line was wired directly to the Tucson Electric Power Co., which owned 80% of the company Garcia had founded in 1981. </P> <P> The Hidden Valley deal, they said, was not a condition for obtaining the line of credit, and Garcia, a major developer, used his own funds to lend Westcon the down payment. </P> <P> Senators Intervene </P> <P> It was during this period that one of the most controversial episodes in the Lincoln case occurred.The suit and other documents allege that Keating and his associates sought to evade regulatory restrictions on such investments by making bogus loans to "straw" property buyers. </P> <P> They also devised a tax plan that let them divert $95 million to Lincoln's parent company by creating "phantom" profits through sham land swaps and loans, the regulators allege, and used accounting gimmicks, legal maneuvering and political string-pulling to further their operations and slow down investigators. </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee decided last week to appoint an outside counsel to investigate Sen.He simply turned Lincoln, an institution whose financial health was questionable when he bought it, from a mortgage lender into a company that prepared raw land for residential construction, and he had a number of projects successfully built, he maintained. </P> <P> Whatever the various government investigations ultimately disclose, it is already clear that Lincoln is one of the worst disasters in the nationwide savings and loan debacle. </P> <P> Began as Lawyer </P> <P> Keating, a collegiate gold medal swimmer in the Pan American Games and a Navy fighter pilot in World War II, began his business career as a lawyer in Cincinnati.Lincoln, they said, was entitled to record the profits on the loans. </P> <P> The recommendations of the regional regulators were not adopted by Gray or M.About two-thirds of them were elderly Southern Californians who bought them at Lincoln branch offices. </P> <P> Some of them have said in lawsuits and congressional testimony that they were persuaded to buy the securities instead of certificates of deposit by American Continental sales representatives, who assured them that the securities were safe. </P> <P> Some have said they thought that the debentures were backed by federal deposit insurance -- a costly mistake, as things turned out. </P> <P> Regulators Cool </P> <P> By 1986, federal regulators in the regional office in San Francisco were becoming distinctly unsympathetic to Keating's operations.She took her life insurance proceeds and "practically beat down the door" at the Lincoln branch to buy American Continental debt securities. </P> <P> After being assured that Lincoln was safe and sound, she had signed two pieces of paper and handed over a $30,000 cashier's check.About the same time, the state Department of Savings and Loan allowed American Continental to set up desks in the lobbies of Lincoln's 29 branches to sell the securities. </P> <P> Although the securities were, in effect, junk bonds, Keating said he would have recommended them to anyone, even to the Roman Catholic charities he supported heavily with donations.What's more, he proposed a rule to require all federally insured thrifts, including state-chartered S&amp;Ls such as Lincoln, to limit direct investments to 10% of their assets. </P> <P> Keating for one was furious.The thrift had obtained audited financial statements from the borrowers, and those documents provided a better picture of possible risks than a consumer credit report, they said. </P> <P> They contended also that regulators made simple mathematical errors in computing such items as how much Lincoln should set aside in reserves to protect against possible losses. </P> <P> The big loans were made to borrowers who came up with 25% down payments, company executives said.Prudently invested, it would help support her modest but comfortable life in Santa Maria, Calif. </P> <P> But Lampel reckoned without Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and Arizona home builder Charles H. Keating Jr., who had acquired the thrift the year before.He said his efforts on Lincoln's behalf never went beyond what a member of Congress can legally do for a constituent who is experiencing problems with the government. </P> <P> Cranston denied that his actions were in any way responsible for the losses facing the government or the people who bought the American Continental debt securities. </P> <P> Bright Projections </P> <P> And what of Keating's enormous bets on the future of Arizona real estate? </P> <P> In brochures for Estrella, his big planned community southwest of Phoenix, Keating boasted that Phoenix would soon become the 12th-largest metropolitan area in the country.Gray later stated publicly that the four senators tried to make a deal for Keating by promising to get Lincoln to make more traditional home mortgages again if Gray would rescind the 10% limit on Lincoln's direct investments. </P> <P> Their effort, Gray declared, was an "abuse of senatorial authority" and "tantamount to an attempt to subvert" the regulatory process. </P> <P> The senators heatedly deny proposing any such deal.
