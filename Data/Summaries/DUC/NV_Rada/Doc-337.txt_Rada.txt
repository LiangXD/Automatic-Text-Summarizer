Britain and the United States refused to discuss this proposal and insisted that the conference should talk about implementing the convention and discuss clauses that would apportion liability in the case of mining pollution.French officials said the conference had been a failure because Britain and the United States had refused to discuss their proposals."The last great wilderness is the size of the United States and Europe put together," Heap said.John Heap, head of Britain's delegation, said London is not prepared to discuss the wilderness park idea if it excludes all mining.Australia and France had proposed that Antarctica be turned into a wilderness park and that the Minerals Convention of 1988, which took six years to negotiate, be scrapped.Britain and the United States have kept their hopes of issuing mining licenses in the Antarctic alive by refusing to accept proposals to turn the continent into a wildlife reserve.
