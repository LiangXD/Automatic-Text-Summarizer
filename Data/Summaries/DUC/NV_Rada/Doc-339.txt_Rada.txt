It is calling on the United States and other nations participating in the conference, which begins Monday in Chile, to designate Antarctica as a world science park.The focus of a dispute between Congress and the State Department is the ratification of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities, on which the State Department has worked for six years.Congressional legislation calling for preservation of Antarctica is awaiting President Bush's signature, but there has been speculation that the Interior Department might urge Bush to veto the measure."We have no time for half-measures if America is to be the world's leader in protecting Antarctica," Vento said.Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on parks and public land, said he fears that recurring degradation has made Antarctica "an environmental time bomb ready to explode."During the peak summer months, about 4,000 people inhabit Antarctica, and tourism is increasing rapidly.Mining in the Antarctic is not compatible with the protection of the continent's fragile environment, many environmentalists contend.According to environmentalists, Antarctica is being marred by air pollution and tourist ships and threatened by mining.
