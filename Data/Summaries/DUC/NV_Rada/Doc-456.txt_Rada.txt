Although Mr Patten did not say so yesterday, he has suggested in the past that he would be prepared to introduce his proposals for a slightly faster pace of democratic development in Hong Kong without China's approval.MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday gave China until the end of the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.Mr Patten said that he was prepared to meet Lu 'at any time and in any place' to reach agreement but had reminded the Chinese they had only until the end of the year.Mr Patten said that they had agreed the best forum for settlement was the Airport Committee of the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group - a place where consensus has been stalled for months.
