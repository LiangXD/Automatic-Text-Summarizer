The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows.If it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu were simply more susceptible to the disease.The zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a strain of "mad cow disease" affecting a type of antelope can be transmitted much more easily than was thought.
