Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwood said.In the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed, Smallwood said."An arson case in the forest is very hard to make," he said.And they don't necessarily have to be mad at the Forest Service."It's just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary (deliberately set) fires," McDonald said.The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set.McDonald, who oversees about 125 Mark Twain employees trained as firefighters, said forest fires cost $25 to $30 an acre to suppress."It's probably 90 percent higher than the national average," said Ron McDonald, Mark Twain's fire control officer.As one of the Forest Service's 125 special law enforcement agents, Smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigating fires in the forests he loves."We had an employee die of a heart attack fighting an arson fire," Smallwood said, referring to a 1976 blaze.He said Mark Twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem.
