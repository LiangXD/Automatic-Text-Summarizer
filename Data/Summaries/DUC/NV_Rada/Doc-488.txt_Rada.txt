Detractors snicker that Biosphere 2 could be the greatest stunt since "War of the Worlds."; "I don't know what they are attempting to do," said Robert D. MacElroy, a scientist at NASA/Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, where plans for a small space cottage are in their infancy.; MacElroy has visited the Biosphere 2 project and said, "There's a pretty grotesque size differential to what we're involved in."There have been so many people with Biosphere 2 who never had anything to do with John Allen 20 years ago."; During construction, Biosphere 2 recruited outside consultants from such reputable institutions as Yale University and the Smithsonian, Dyhr said."It was hard to figure out what they were up to."; In the years since the commune disbanded, Allen's vision and Bass's deep pockets have funded ecological ventures from Katmandu to France to western Australia.In this biological maze, plants will recycle human wastes and turn them into the sustenance of life -- air, food and water.; Biosphere 2 could be the first step in the construction of a massive way station in space, its developers hope, and at the very least could help improve life on Earth.; But as the "Biospherians" prepare to don their spiffy blue jump suits and kiss the outside world goodbye, Earthlings are watching with a mixture of awe, fascination and skepticism.; Supporters gush that the grand experiment rivals the moon landing.In the past, Bass has denied being influenced by Allen, who told the Arizona Daily Star in June that he never operated "any mystical program."; "The whole cult thing is ridiculous," said Kathleen Dyhr, spokeswoman for Biosphere 2.
