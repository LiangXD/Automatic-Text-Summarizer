Another spokewoman for the actress, Lisa Del Favaro, said Miss Taylor's family was at her bedside.While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator, it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G. Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert who emphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition.The 58-year-old actress, who won best-actress Oscars for "Butterfield 8" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," has been hospitalized more than two weeks.Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said.
