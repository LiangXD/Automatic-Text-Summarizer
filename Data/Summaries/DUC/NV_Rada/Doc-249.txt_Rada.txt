Officials at the the Ljubljanska Bank, Slovenia's largest bank into which the majority of the foreign exchange accounts were originally deposited, are hoping that the the government of Slovenia will guarantee these debts and open up negotiations with the NBY for the eventual return of the deposits.Of this amount, Slovenia accepts that its allocated share of that debt is Dollars 1.8bn.However, negotiating what share of the unallocated federal debt Slovenia should assume is already proving difficult.Mr Kranjec says that the Bank of Slovenia has already proposed negotiations on this issue, as well as trying to discuss the status of the NBY'S foreign exchange reserves, the clearing balances with the countries of the former CMEA socialist trading organisation, and operations of banks.Mr Marko Kranjec, vice-governor of the Bank of Slovenia, or central bank, reckons Slovenes will have to wait years before they can obtain their foreign exchange savings.
