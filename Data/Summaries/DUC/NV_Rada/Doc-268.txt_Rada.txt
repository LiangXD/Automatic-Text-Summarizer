Guzman's faction, Tapia said, represents the imprisoned Shining Path, while the one led by "Feliciano" is made up of the terrorists who are still free.The Shining Path does not intend to seek reconciliation in the country, has disarmed itself neither militarily nor ideologically, and is instead trying to become a semi-legal party operating as a shock force against the opposition, subversion specialist Carlos Tapia has said.Tapia said: "The Shining Path was defeated, but it seems that after the beginning of negotiations, Abimael Guzman's leadership has been consolidated, tied to the commitment to organize a second party congress."
