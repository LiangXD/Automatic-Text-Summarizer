"For eight years this same coalition of Republican senators has blocked any increase in the minimum wage," said Sen.The bill due for House debate today calls for raising the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1992 and has no provision for a sub-minimum training wage, an idea long opposed by the sponsors and organized labor, which has been lobbying heavily against such proposals.And the president, at a White House meeting with reporters, insisted he had made his best and last offer to raise the wage, which has been frozen for eight years.Backers of House legislation to raise the minimum wage lowered their target to $4.55 an hour on the eve of debate as President Bush declared he had the votes to sustain a veto should Congress go above $4.25.But the sponsors, facing mounting pressure from the White House and moderate Democrats, agreed to scale back the final level to $4.55 and add a training wage in an amendment worked out Tuesday that has the support of the House leadership.
