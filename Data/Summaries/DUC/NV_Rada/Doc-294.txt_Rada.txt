In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said.Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said."There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said Person, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than 25 years."This is just a normal day," said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center.A 7 reading is a "major" earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a "great" quake, capable of tremendous damage.About 800 quakes between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.9 are recorded each year, said USGS spokesman Don Finley in Washington.At least four moderate earthquakes rattled parts of the world, but there was nary a tremor Monday along the New Madrid Fault, where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to occur.
