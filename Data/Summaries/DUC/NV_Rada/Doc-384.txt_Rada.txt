David Raskin, a University of Utah psychologist often called upon to support polygraphs in the courtroom, said he favored the federal law because lie detectors were being misused to predict future performance in the workplace.Reading from a Defense Department statement regarding the use of polygraphs, Turner said: "In all instances the polygraph exam process produced data of important security or criminal significance which was not otherwise obtainable."Jurors are very cautious with polygraph evidence."They have been useless and give misleading information," said Leonard Saxe, a visiting professor of psychology at Brandeis University and a leading opponent of polygraph testing.The court, noting polygraph studies have shown success rates varying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent, said: "There remains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraph testing to detect deceit."New Mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a polygraph examination as evidence, with the trial judge deciding whether the tests meet certain standards."No doubt businesses have had to abandon 75-80 percent of polygraph tests," said Joseph Buckley, a spokesman for the American Polygraph Association, a trade group based in Chattanooga, Tenn.
