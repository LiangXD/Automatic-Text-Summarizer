The Las Vegas Hilton currently claims the title with 3,174 rooms but will be surpassed next March when an expansion is completed at the Flamingo Hilton, giving that Strip resort 3,530 rooms. The Flamingo will hold the title only a few months, until the Excalibur opens next summer with 4,032 rooms. Circus Circus, the parent corporation for Excalibur, currently has 2,800 rooms in Las Vegas, as does Bally's Hotel on the Strip. The Riviera Hotel currently has 2,200 rooms but a planned expansion will give the resort 3,800 rooms by June of 1992.
