Church bells pealed in the city of Angeles, adjacent to the air base, warning the more than 300,000 residents to seek shelter.; Reporters at the scene said the blast created a greenish-gray mushroom cloud like an atomic bomb. Another eruption occured shortly before noon.; Scientists said the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could come later.; Most probably there will be more eruptions, said seismologist Julio Sabit.; Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, said everyone within a 12-mile radius should evacuate, or even within 18 miles, to be safe. ; 'Dark mushroom'; The smoke is very thick, like a dark mushroom in the sky, Gus Abelgas, a reporter for ABS-CBN television, said in a broadcast from Botolan, near the volcano's western slopes. But Angeles police said Tuesday that no one was evacuating the area.; Some refused to go; A Philippine police major identified only as Major Reyes said he visited a remote settlement near the volcano after the blast and tried to talk a handful of residents into leaving. Finance officers issued partial pay to personnel who had to leave before having a chance to go to the bank.; Smaller than anticipated; The eruption appeared to be smaller than that anticipated by Peter Lipman, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist in Menlo Park, who on Monday had said an eruption as massive as that of Mount St. Helens could occur any day.; After the eruption, Lipman tried unsuccessfully to telephone five USGS researchers monitoring the volcano from Clark Air Base.; In a conversation with Lipman half an hour before the eruption, the researchers said the volcano had had small eruptions earlier in the day. At the time of the phone call, they were planning a helicopter ride above the volcano to survey the size of the lava dome inside its crater.; There are about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines.
