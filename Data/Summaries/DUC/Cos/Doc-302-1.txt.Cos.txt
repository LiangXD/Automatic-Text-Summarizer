Freshman congressman Larkin Smith (R-Miss.) died in a light plane crash in Mississippi, authorities said Monday, making him the second member of the House killed in an aviation accident in a week. Smith and the pilot, Charles Vierling, who also was killed, were flying from Hattiesburg to Gulfport, according to federal and local officials. Smith, 45, died the same day the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep. News of Smith's death was followed by an outpouring of sympathy from Mississippi to Washington, even as Smith's colleagues were still mourning Leland's death. Smith, a former sheriff and police chief, was already developing a reputation on the House Judiciary Committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs. Jack Barker, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman here, said the plane lost radar contact at 9:25. I thought at the time it was unusual for a plane to be in the area at night. The plane belonged to the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies Inc. in Gulfport. The institute immediately issued a statement saying that Smith had requested use of the plane to accommodate his busy schedule. The statement said the plane, manufactured in 1973, and purchased by the institute last year, had a current inspection. Smith was elected last November to represent Mississippi's 5th congressional district. Ray Mabus, who called his death a tragic loss for the state and ordered flags on state property flown at half staff. Gaston, who worked for Smith nine years both in the sheriff's department and earlier when Smith was Gulfport police chief, called Smith a pillar of strength.
