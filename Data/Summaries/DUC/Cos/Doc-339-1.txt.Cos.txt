Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) said Thursday on the eve of an international conference on the future of the frozen continent. It is calling on the United States and other nations participating in the conference, which begins Monday in Chile, to designate Antarctica as a world science park. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on parks and public land, said he fears that recurring degradation has made Antarctica an environmental time bomb ready to explode. We have no time for half-measures if America is to be the world's leader in protecting Antarctica, Vento said. Congressional legislation calling for preservation of Antarctica is awaiting President Bush's signature, but there has been speculation that the Interior Department might urge Bush to veto the measure. The legislation for the first time would apply U.S. environmental protection laws to any activity in Antarctica sponsored by an agency of the U.S. government. The focus of a dispute between Congress and the State Department is the ratification of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities, on which the State Department has worked for six years. The convention, signed two years ago but not ratified by 17 of 20 nations, would regulate mineral exploration but not ban it, as the congressional action would. But Tucker Scully, director of the office of ocean affairs at the State Department and the lead U.S. negotiator for Antarctic issues, disagreed with the hands-off approach to the continent. During the peak summer months, about 4,000 people inhabit Antarctica, and tourism is increasing rapidly.
