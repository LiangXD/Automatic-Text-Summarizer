"Mad cow disease" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s. The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement. The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans. Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Great Britain in July, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the agriculture ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months. David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of "BSE hysteria" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is "remote." The report said the disease was impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it did not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies. The Southwood report said it was "most unlikely" that the disease was a threat to humans. The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that BSE was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.
