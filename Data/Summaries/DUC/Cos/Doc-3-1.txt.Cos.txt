Mad cow disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry. Concern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject Topic A in the pubs and press of Britain, and has put a serious crimp in domestic beef sales. The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the mad cow scare. Therefore, British officials believe, France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. France accounted for slightly more than half of Britain's beef exports last year, buying 70,000 tons of beef worth $264 million. Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently. On May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that a Siamese cat had died from a disease identical to BSE. Beef sales dropped, with surveys showing that about a quarter of British households had stopped eating it. Some regulations were enacted to fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne said her family was still eating British beef.
