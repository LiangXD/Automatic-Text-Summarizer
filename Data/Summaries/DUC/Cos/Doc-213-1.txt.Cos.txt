Now, in the wake of that firestorm, local firefighters are looking up at the hills that surround this area and wondering not whether, but only when and where.; I know it's there, said Saratoga Fire Chief Ernest Kraule. Instead of an eight- or 10-inch water main ensuring pressure for fire hoses, the mountains are laced with two-inch pipes.; Those are the risks you take when you live in an area like this, said Dean Lucke, chief of the forestry department's San Mateo-Santa Cruz ranger unit. But, often, that means firefighters have to overcome narrow roads, weak bridges, inadequate water pressure and gridlock from fleeing residents.; Challenge for firefighters; Many of the South Bay's most vulnerable areas -- such as Redwood Estates above Los Gatos and Emerald Lake Hills above Redwood City -- began as colonies of summer homes, a handful of secluded cottages strung along narrow winding roads. Now, these communities are the year-round home for thousands, often still dependent on volunteer firefighters and an overtaxed network of roads and water lines.; On a good day, trying to maneuver fire apparatus on those roads is tough, said Steve Cavallero, a battalion chief for the Redwood City Fire Department, which covers a portion of Emerald Lake Hills. Combine that with panic, with people getting out of the way, and you're setting the stage for disaster. ; An estimated 25,000 people live in the communities along Highway 9 between Santa Cruz and Boulder Creek, the curvy, two-lane road that would be the only way out in the case of a major fire. Ed Ekers, chief of the Santa Cruz city fire department, worries about sending his trucks through a tunnel of fire if flames were ever to spread across the canopy of trees above Highway 9.; Will there be water?; Even if they can reach a blaze, firefighters know there may not be any water to fight it.
