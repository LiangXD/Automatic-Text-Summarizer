The new drug was developed at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., where doctors tested it on patients with hairy cell leukemia. Doctors are also testing the drug against chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The Scripps doctors concluded that the medicine, called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA, "may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia." Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed in recent years. However, interferon is less effective, and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.
