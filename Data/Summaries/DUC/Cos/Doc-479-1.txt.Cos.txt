The Democratic sponsors of the bill, scheduled for floor debate beginning today, also agreed Tuesday to include a sub-minimum training wage in their measure, a 60-day proposal that falls far short of the six-month period demanded by Bush. And the president, at a White House meeting with reporters, insisted he had made his best and last offer to raise the wage, which has been frozen for eight years. The administration guidelines include raising the minimum wage, now at $3.35 an hour, to $4.25 an hour by 1992, provided employers can pay new hires a "training wage" of $3.35 an hour for six months. Mrs. Dole, appearing today on "CBS This Morning," said, "Many more jobs and job opportunities are saved if you have a six-month training wage." "We've thought out a level of increase on the minimum wage that would help people and yet would not add gasoline to any inflation fires that are burning." "For eight years this same coalition of Republican senators has blocked any increase in the minimum wage," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor of a Senate bill to raise the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1992. But the sponsors, facing mounting pressure from the White House and moderate Democrats, agreed to scale back the final level to $4.55 and add a training wage in an amendment worked out Tuesday that has the support of the House leadership. The training wage would initially be $3.35 an hour but would increase to 85 percent of the subsequent increases in the minimum wage.
