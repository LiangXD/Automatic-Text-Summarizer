Less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia to the brink of political chaos. After the shooting of candidate Carlos Pizarro in a jetliner Thursday, the country's largest newspaper implored the government to "do something, for the love of God." "The gravest aspect of Colombia's bloodletting is that the government has no idea how to even slow it," said a member of a regional human rights committee based in Medellin, the cocaine capital. In recent interviews, Pizarro, the candidate for the leftist April 19 Movement, or M-19, admitted he was afraid. But the Medellin cartel denied involvement, and no government official has yet said who was responsible for Pizarro's assassination. On Saturday Antonio Navarro, a longtime guerrilla leader of the April 19 Movement, announced he would take Pizarro's place as candidate for president. Several politicians and analysts said an armed assassin could not have been aboard a jetliner without the complicity of government and airport security personnel. Former president Alfonso Lopez said the assassinations of three candidates indicated that Colombia's armed forces must be reorganized. One of the country's presidential candidates, Alvaro Gomez, said Friday that Barco should name a three-man council to run Colombia's security forces to avoid a military coup. "Never has there been such a great and pathetic image of anarchy," said Gomez, a presidential candidate of the Conservative Party. Both Barco and his party's presidential candidate, Cesar Gaviria, have linked Colombia's salvation to constitutional reform.
