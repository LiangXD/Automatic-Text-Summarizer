A U.S. Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed and burned in Britain this morning while on a routine training flight. Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, originally identified the plane as an A-10 aircraft from the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Bentwaters, England. The Air Force later corrected that statement, saying the A-10 was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Alconbury. The A-10, a twin-engine jet designed to support troops by killing enemy tanks and other ground targets, is an older model plane designed to be highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude and to carry a lot of bombs and ammunition. Nonetheless, today's crash comes just two weeks to the day after another A-10 slammed into the West German city of Remscheid, killing five and injuring dozens. On the same day as the crash in Remscheid, an A-10 crashed near the heart of the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation, about 80 miles west of Tuscon, but the pilot ejected safely. The Air Force describes the A-10 as "a simple, effective and survivable twin-engine jet aircraft that can be used against all ground targets... The aircraft has excellent maneuverability at low air speeds and altitude and highly accurate weapons delivery."
