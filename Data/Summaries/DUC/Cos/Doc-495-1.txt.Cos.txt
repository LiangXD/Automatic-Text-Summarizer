America's senior military officer Tuesday endorsed the East Bloc's move toward a more defensive military posture and reassured his Warsaw Pact counterparts that the United States and its NATO allies will not launch an offensive military operation against Eastern Europe. At a meeting in Vienna, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cited initial evidence that the Warsaw Pact is restructuring its forces in line with new defensive military doctrines in the wake of the Cold War. Powell also met Tuesday for the first time with the Soviet chief of staff, Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, an encounter that officials said would allow Powell to raise further questions about the Soviets' efforts to restructure their military forces. Powell delivered his remarks on the first day of an unprecedented military doctrine seminar organized by a 35-nation forum that negotiates limitations on the military operations and practices of its member countries, most of which are European nations. Saying the seminar's task is to help shape a new order in Europe, Powell defended U.S. military initiatives that have introduced to Europe new, long-range weapons designed to attack Soviet forces sent in to reinforce the first wave of a Warsaw Pact attack on Western Europe. He also echoed suggestions by other U.S. officials that American ground forces will shrink significantly in response to changed military threats in Europe, while the U.S. Navy is expected to remain large.
