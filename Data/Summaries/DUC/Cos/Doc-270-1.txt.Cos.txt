END SUMMARY Although La Republica, a prominent anti-Fujimori daily, provided little information on the origins of the important and unusual document that it published in a special 25 January supplement, it assured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining the Shining Path's struggle for a peace agreement was a genuine Shining Path statement. The Shining Path leadership's sudden willingness to pursue peace talks with the government, just as the 31 October national referendum vote was approaching, raised questions in the media about whether the letters really represented authoritative Shining Path policy [see box].(See Note 2) (Note 2) Among other objectives, the narrowly successful referendum was designed to allow the president to serve a second successive term. Thee analyst concluded, therefore, that the insurgents' peace strategy represents an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman's leadership and recognition that circumstances have changed. (Note 3) For example, in his presentation of the video recording of Guzman's first call for peace talks, Fujimori claimed that the Shining Path political leadership has tacitly admitted that the Peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in confronting the Shining Path (Lima Radio and TV, 4 October 1993). Outlook La Republica's assessment of the Shining Path peace strategy document may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling for peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders. At the same time, however, by concluding that the published strategy statement is merely the Shining Path's declaration of temporary retreat, the daily has raised new questions about the credibility of Fujimori's claim that the call for peace represents a victory for the government.
