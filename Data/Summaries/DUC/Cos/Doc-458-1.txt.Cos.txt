CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with Beijing. The challenge was immediately rejected by the Hong Kong government, which accused China of violating Anglo-Chinese agreements and its own law for Hong Kong which comes into force after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in June 1997. British and US businesses with interests in Hong Kong were more sanguine about prospects for the colony, indicating that Beijing's threat would have no impact on investment decisions. Share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange fell nearly 3 per cent in trading yesterday, although this was largely in response to comments by a senior Chinese official late last week over the validity of the award of land to a consortium to build a container terminal in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government responded to China's latest attack by declaring that Beijing was in breach of both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future and the 1990 Basic Law - the colony's post-1997 constitution - drafted by Beijing.
