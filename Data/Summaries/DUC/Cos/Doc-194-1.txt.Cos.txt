With a third presidential candidate assassinated, Colombia's government refused Friday to put off next month's election and vowed to keep up the fight against drug traffickers. A telefaxed communique, purportedly from the Medellin drug cartel, denied responsibility Friday for the assassination of presidential candidate Carlos Pizarro, who died in a hail of bullets Thursday aboard a Colombian jetliner carrying 97 people. But on Thursday, within hours of Pizarro's assassination, a man had called the national radio network station Caracol and related in detail how the cartel had allegedly ordered the former guerrilla's killing. Friday's telefax accused police of instigating violence in order to force the government to continue its crackdown on traffickers, and accused the police of putting out false communiques purported to be from the cartel. Luis Carlos Galan of the governing Liberal Party, prompted the government to launch a U.S.-backed crackdown on Colombia's cocaine cartels. On Friday, thousands of men, women and children filed past Pizarro's coffin, displayed in an open patio in the Congress building. Supporters of Pizarro's M-19 movement burned buses and threw rocks at police in clashes in several cities. Hundreds of leftist guerrillas belonging to the M-19 rebel group laid down their arms last month and formed a political party with Pizarro as its presidential candidate. Government officials had said Pizarro could have helped mediate peace agreements with other leftist insurgents. Governing party candidate Cesar Gaviria, the presidential front-runner, suspended campaign activities following the Pizarro killing. The Patriotic Union's presidential candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo, was fatally wounded March 22 at the Bogota airport by an assassin with a machine gun. They apparently were part of an assassination squad with orders to kill Pizarro if he survived the flight, police said.
