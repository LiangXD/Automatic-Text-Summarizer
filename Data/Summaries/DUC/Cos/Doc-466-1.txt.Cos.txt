The balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia, Dr. Wald wrote in an accompanying commentary on the analysis, which was conducted by University of Edinburgh epidemiologist Leo Kinlen. Dr. Kinlen, who directs the university's Cancer Epidemiology Unit, examined leukemia deaths from a U.S. study that had tracked veterans' smoking between 1954 and 1969. The earlier study tallied overall deaths from various causes, including 723 deaths due to leukemia. Previous studies have observed higher death rates from leukemia among smokers, but either involved fewer patients or didn't compare amounts smoked with incidence of the disease. If the link is causal, an editorial in the medical journal said, then smoking is a more important cause of leukemia in adults than all other known causes combined. But leukemia represents the third-leading cause of death in U.S. children, behind accidents and birth defects, according to the American Cancer Society.
