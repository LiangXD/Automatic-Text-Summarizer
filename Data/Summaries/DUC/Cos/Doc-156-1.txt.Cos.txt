Canadians were shamed, angry and saddened Tuesday that national hero Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal for using drugs to enhance his performance. Sports Minister Jean Charest, who called the incident "a national embarrassment," said Johnson will be banned from Canada's national team for life. "If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again _ my brother is not on drugs." Throughout Monday evening, local children attempted to raise a chorus of "Ben! "We've just seen the destruction of a role model," said former downhill skier Ken Read, of Calgary, now Canada's representative on the International Olympic Committee's athletics commission. Mike Sokowski, a teammate at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, said: "Ben's a pretty simple guy. Canadian speedskater Gaetan Boucher judged the sprinter harshly, saying he has "no respect" for an athlete who takes drugs. "From time to time people would come to me in a private way _ and this happened one or two times... that maybe Ben Johnson is using steroids or other drugs," he said. Charest said he didn't press Johnson to have a drug test because he thought the sprinter was aware that medal winners at the Olympics would be tested for drugs immediately following competition. "Everybody knew in advance that Mr. Johnson, if he wins a medal, was going to be tested," said Charest.
