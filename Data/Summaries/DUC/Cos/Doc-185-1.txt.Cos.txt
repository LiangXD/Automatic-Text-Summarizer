Officials warned residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and nearby islands to bolt down everything loose and stock up on food and water Wednesday as Hurricane Dean rumbled through the eastern Caribbean. Dean was upgraded from a tropical storm to the second hurricane of the Atlantic season Wednesday, and by nightfall the National Weather Center in Puerto Rico reported the hurricane's winds had strengthened to 80 mph. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Leeward Islands from Antigua to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, said forecasters at the National Hurricane Center near Miami. An advisory issued by the National Weather Service in San Juan for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico advised residents to "secure loose objects or move them indoors," board or tape windows and stock up on emergency supplies such as drinking water, food that needs no refrigeration and batteries. "This is a dangerous storm and should not be taken lightly, even though it is a minimal hurricane," it said. Forecasters said the storm was expected to first hit land in Barbuda, the easternmost Leeward Island and move northwest toward the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico over the next 24 to 36 hours. Government radio in the twin island state of Antigua and Barbuda said Dean was expected to hit Barbuda on Wednesday night, and warned residents to bar windows, latch down loose objects and stock up on water. In Coral Gables, Fla., hurricane specialist Jim Gross called Dean a small hurricane, with hurricane-force winds confined to within 25 miles of its center.
