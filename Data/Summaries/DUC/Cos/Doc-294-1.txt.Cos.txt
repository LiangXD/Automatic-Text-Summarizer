At least four moderate earthquakes rattled parts of the world, but there was nary a tremor Monday along the New Madrid Fault, where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to occur. "This is just a normal day," said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. "There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said Person, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than 25 years. As Person talked, 24 seismographs etched out activity recorded by monitoring equipment in different parts of the United States, ranging from Alaska to Tennessee. With a measured eye, he estimated the quake was magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 on the Richter scale. Three were in the South Pacific, a 5.9-magnitude shaker near New Caledonia, and quakes of 5.1 and 5.0 in the area of Tonga. About 800 quakes between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.9 are recorded each year, said USGS spokesman Don Finley in Washington. A 7 reading is a "major" earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a "great" quake, capable of tremendous damage. The big San Francisco Bay area quake last year registered 7.1 on the Richter scale. In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said. This fall, there have been two in the New Madrid Fault area, magnitude 4.6 on Sept. Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said. One woman called daily, alerting Person that an earthquake was about to occur, based on the number of birds that crossed her windshield as she drove down the street.
