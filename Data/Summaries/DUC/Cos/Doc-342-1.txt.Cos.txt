With the demise of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War and worsening economic problems, former East Bloc countries are slashing Antarctic research budgets. But the National Science Foundation, which runs U.S. bases, thinks that the government's commitment to Antarctica will wane, what with new restrictions on mineral development and declining Soviet competition. The U.S. Navy for instance, regularly pays for about one-fourth of all oceanographic research, much of it centered on the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. This year, after a budget battle, more money was appropriated for U.S. Antarctica research, partly by redirecting funds earmarked for housing for the poor. But a major reason the number of Antarctic research bases doubled to 68 over the past 20 years had little to do with science. Instead, in October, the Antarctic treaty nations approved a substitute that bars mineral and oil exploration for at least 50 years and requires environmental safeguards for research bases. Critics say the environmental provisions will make science more expensive in Antarctica, already the costliest research site apart from outer space. The countries with the strongest commitment to Antarctica may turn out to be the ones that are tied to the continent by nationalism, not science. Argentina and Chile claim parts of Antarctica as extensions of their countries, even though the Antarctic Treaty effectively makes the continent international territory. They bring families to live in Antarctica, not just scientists, encourage women to give birth at their bases and postmark letters there -- all to back claims of sovereignty.
