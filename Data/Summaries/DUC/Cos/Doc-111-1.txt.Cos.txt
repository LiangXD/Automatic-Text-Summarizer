Elizabeth Taylor has rallied from a near-fatal bout with pneumonia _ and even joked about coming out in her "balcony attire" to wave to reporters _ but is "not out of the woods," doctors say. "I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and I believe that has now passed," Dr. Bernard Weintraub, a lung specialist treating Miss Taylor at St. Johns Hospital and Health Center, said Wednesday. The 58-year-old actress was taken off the ventilator that had aided her breathing for several days and was smiling again and "very happy the tube was out," said Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist. Miss Taylor has had back troubles since she fell off a horse during filming in 1945 of "National Velvet." The hospital released a statement on Miss Taylor's behalf thanking fans and friends for their cards and letters.
