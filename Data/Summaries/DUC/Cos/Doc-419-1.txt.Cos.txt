Las Vegas, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and swingers in recent years, is ready for the Southern Baptists. The 14.8 million-member Southern Baptist Convention has more than doubled its membership in a quarter century and surpassed the United Methodist Church as the nation's largest Protestant denomination. Las Vegas is one of only 15 U.S. cities that can provide the hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention, said Alvin C. Shackleford, a convention spokesman. Reasons include the reluctance of Southern Baptists to expose their children to the gambling scene, the city's remoteness from the denomination's strongholds in the Southeast and an apparent lack of burning issues as the struggle between the denomination's moderates and conservatives stretches into its 11th year. "The choice of Las Vegas was deliberate in that the Southern Baptist Convention hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in Las Vegas," said Stan Hastey, executive director of the Southern Baptist Alliance, a moderate group. A series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign Saturday in which about 2,000 Southern Baptists were expected knock on doors around Las Vegas. To keep the focus on evangelism when the meetings begin, convention President Jerry Vines said he is seeking postponement of a controversial proposal by conservatives to create a Religious Liberty Commission. "Las Vegas is probably no more notorious in its pagan qualities than any other city," Hastey said. In addition to bringing in up to $15 million in revenue, the Southern Baptist convention should help the city's image, Powers said.
