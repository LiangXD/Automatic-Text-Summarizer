The director of the county Social Services Agency wants all Orange County residents, including illegal aliens, to be counted in the 1990 Census, and he will ask the Board of Supervisors to support his position. In a letter to the supervisors, Larry Leaman, director of the agency, urged the board to adopt the resolution supporting a complete count of all county residents and opposing all attempts to systematically exclude any groups from the census. In 1985, before the Federal Immigration Reform Act, the number of illegal aliens in the county was estimated at 300,000. In Santa Ana, home to 44.5% of the county's Latinos, city officials worried about the ramifications of undercounting its residents. If those residents had been included, it could have meant another $2.2 million in state and federal revenue, according to city officials.
