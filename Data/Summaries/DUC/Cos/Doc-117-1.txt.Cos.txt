Elizabeth Taylor will remain in the hospital six more weeks due to complications in her fifth week of treatment for pneumonia, doctors said. The Oscar-winning star of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "Butterfield 8" entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with a sinus infection, but her condition deteriorated and she was moved to St. John's for treatment of viral pneumonia.
