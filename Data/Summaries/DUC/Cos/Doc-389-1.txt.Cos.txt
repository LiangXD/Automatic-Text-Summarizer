The plane was flying on a scheduled flight using the internationally established and published Amber 59 airway that is used at least 14 times a week, five of which between the same two airports. Seconds after the last communication between the plane and the tower, the plane was targeted by two surface-to-air Standard guided missiles from USS Vincennes, the most technologically sophisticated naval ship.... USS Vincennes had well over 14 minutes _ and not four minutes as American officials have claimed _ of prior knowledge that the target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai. Notwithstanding the fact that the Iranian air force had no F-14 operations in the morning of that unfortunate Sunday in or around the Strait of Hormuz, it may be noted that the military experts well-familiar with F-14 and its capabilities have held that F-14 could not have presented any serious danger to the USS Vincennes or any surface target for that matter. Possibly the most fallacious argument of the American officials in justifying their inexplicable crime was a claim that the airliner did not respond to the alleged warnings issued by the warship. While every available evidence including the transcripts read earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any warning, many have contended that in such a short and routine flight, the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency civilian frequency. Furthermore, because the ship failed to identify the target of its alleged warnings, the pilot of the airliner of a scheduled flight should not have reasonably taken it as directed against himself. Furthermore, positioning itself right in the middle of an international civil airway, it is ironic that the ship expected the plane to go outside of the corridor, not be coming onto the Vincennes.
