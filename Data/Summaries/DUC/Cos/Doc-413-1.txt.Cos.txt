Fire broke out aboard a Soviet passenger liner carrying French tourists on a cruise of the Mediterranean, but the blaze was put out by the crew and no passengers were injured, Tass reported Monday. It cited local news reports as saying the ship had docked at the Maltese port of Valletta, and that its passengers had been offered sightseeing trips around the island south of Sicily. The tourists were expected to continue their voyage on another Soviet ship, and the crew of the Shota Rustaveli was to make repairs and bring the ship home, Tass said.
