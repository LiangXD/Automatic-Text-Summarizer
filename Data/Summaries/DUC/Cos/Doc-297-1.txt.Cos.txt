A single-engine airplane crashed Tuesday into a ditch beside a dirt road on the outskirts of Albuquerque, killing all five people aboard, authorities said. Four adults and one child died in the crash, which witnesses said occurred about 5 p.m., when it was raining, Albuquerque police Sgt. Walter Ramazzini Jr., 17, of Albuquerque, said he was sitting about 100 yards from the airplane when it crashed. "He was going east, making a left turn from the airport," Ramazzini said. "To correct again for that, he went again to the left... and went nose-first into the ground," said Ramazzini, a student pilot. The airplane "wasn't very high _ maybe 100 feet," Ramazzini said. He said he was among the first four people at the crash site. He said the witnesses thought the airplane might blow up, so they retreated. Firefighters arrived later and sprayed the crumpled airplane with water before rescue crews removed the bodies from the craft.
