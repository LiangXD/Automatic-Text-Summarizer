Bangkok in November, London in April and Stockholm in May.; Skiers have mountain ranges, tennis players have resorts, why can't a runner take a marathon vacation? said Thorn Gilligan, president of Marathon Tours in Boston. It's a celebration for the sport as much as a competition. ; Gilligan took 5,500 people last year on 20 tours to countries from Bermuda to Moscow. In addition to air fare and hotel, runners are guaranteed spots in restricted entry races such as the London Marathon. Qualifying times are not required.; London, the most popular European city to visit, holds the world's largest marathon (April 12 next year). Each city has something unique. ; The cities are different, but most marathons include a carbo-loading pasta party the night before, medical exams, a post-race celebration, commemorative T-shirts and awards to finishers. Entry fees vary; Brussels is $16, Venice $40.; Marathon Tours includes the entry price in the package. Some marathons, like Portland's, include additional races: a five-mile run, a five-mile walk and a kids run. The Tel Aviv Marathon course went past houses hit by Scud missiles during the Gulf War. In the recent Chicago Marathon, a German man ran with a camera, snapping photos every few miles.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; If you're interested in combining a vacation and marathon, here are some firms to contact:; (box) Marathon Tours, 108 Main St., Charlestown, Mass.
