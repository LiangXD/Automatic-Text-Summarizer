CHINA stepped up the war of words over the future of Hong Kong yesterday, threatening to ignore the results of democratic elections proposed by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, once it assumes control in 1997. Mr Lu Ping, China's senior official for Hong Kong affairs, said that if Mr Patten pressed ahead with his democratic reforms Beijing would start a 'new kitchen' in 1997 - a Chinese expression which means making a fresh start. Mr Lu also added his voice to personal criticism of the governor, saying that he would be condemned by history over his handling of the Hong Kong issue. The remarks by Mr Lu, head of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, were greeted with relief by the Hong Kong stock market, which had been bracing itself for a more uncompromising stand. Mr Lu said China would have to make preparations ahead of 1997 for the cancellation of Mr Patten's proposed democratic reforms; but he stopped short of saying China would set up an alternative administration in Hong Kong before the end of British rule. In Hong Kong, Mr Patten reiterated his preparedness to hold talks with China about his proposed 1994-95 elections.
