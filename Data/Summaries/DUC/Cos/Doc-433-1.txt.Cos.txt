To justify seizing Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., regulators arbitrarily wrote down the value of its $1.4-billion loan portfolio as 50% less and slashed the worth of its extensive land, hotel and stock holdings by 75%, the thrift's former owner said Wednesday. Reading from a Federal Home Loan Bank Board analysis of Lincoln's loan and equity portfolios prepared a week after the government imposed a conservatorship April 14, 1989, Keating called the numbers absurd. For nearly a year, Keating has asserted that he ran Lincoln soundly, and that regulators could show the thrift was insolvent only by placing a lower value on its assets. Comparing the figures from the regulators' analysis with those provided by American Continental's chief financial officer, he testified Wednesday that only 3% of Lincoln's $1.4-billion mortage-loan portfolio was more than 60 days in default. James Murphy, an attorney representing the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, repeatedly objected to Keating comparing the numbers from the regulators' April 21 analysis and Keating's own figures on the status of Lincoln's loans and equity holdings as of Dec. The Office of Thrift Supervision succeeded the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as the industry's chief regulator under the $50-billion savings and loan bailout passed last year by Congress. It wasn't until August that the regulators asserted that Lincoln's alleged losses actually exceeded the value of its assets and imposed a receivership that took ownership of the thrift from Keating.
