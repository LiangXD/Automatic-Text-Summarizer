The liner was freed Tuesday, and the ship was then docked while the Coast Guard makes safety checks. Thursday, Coast Guard Petty Officer Ken Beatty said the ship passed all inspections and there was no serious damage from the grounding. The ship had been due to start on a two-day cruise later today, but that was canceled after the second fire broke out, authorities said. An hour after this morning's fire was controlled, about 300 crew members sat or stood in small groups alongside the Port of History Museum where the ship was tied up. Many still wearin the orange life preservers they had put om when they abandoned the ship.
