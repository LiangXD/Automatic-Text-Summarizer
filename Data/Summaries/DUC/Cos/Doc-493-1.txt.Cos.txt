Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to become the nation's top military officer. 30. Bush praised Powell, a decorated veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam, as "a complete soldier" as well as a distinguished scholar. Powell fits the mold of Bush's national security advisers, like-minded pragmatists who favor consensus-building rather than confrontation. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, called Powell "an excellent nominee." Contests among the services are widely expected to reach new highs as the military budget shrinks and the assessment of the Soviet threat diminishes. As well, Powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political finesse with Congress are as essential as toughened battlefield instincts. Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have outweighed his military experience. He's had experiences few can match," said Robert Sims, a former Pentagon spokesman who knew Powell when he served as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's military aide. Powell currently is commander of the Army Forces Command in Fort MacPherson, Ga., responsible for the combat readiness of 1 million troops on active, reserve or National Guard duty. Along with his predecessor as national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, Powell was credited with helping the Reagan White House recover from the Iran-Contra affair. Before his stint at the NSC, Powell commanded the Army V Corps in West Germany for six months. Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City and raised in the South Bronx. Powell served in Southeast Asia as an adviser to South Vietnamese units in 1962 and 1963 and as executive officer of an infantry battalion and as a division operations officer in 1968 and 1969.
