Domestically, the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Internationally, it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans. On one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries. The reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like Bank of Boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities, bank analysts said. For instance, if Manufacturers Hanover Corp. imitated Bank of Boston's action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, Keefe Bruyette estimates. Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on whether it might follow Bank of Boston's action. Other large New York banks also declined to disclose their plans, although a spokeman for Chase Manhattan Corp., said, We're obviously looking at it. Mellon Bank Corp. said yesterday that it expects a fourth-quarter loss of about $220 million, and that it would increase loan-loss reserves by about $180 million to cover troubled foreign loans. The stocks of several major money-center banks fell sharply yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, the nation's 15th biggest banking concern, charged off $25.4 million in troubled foreign loans during the third quarter. First Chicago Corp., the 11th largest banking concern, charged off $48.9 million in Third World loans during the quarter. And even before the big reserves were set aside, banks were quietly charging off Latin debt, though on a smaller scale.
