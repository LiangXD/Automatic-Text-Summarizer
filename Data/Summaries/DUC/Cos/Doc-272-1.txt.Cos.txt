In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won. Democratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor had spirited competition in 1984 when he won with 57%; this year he has no opponent at all. Senators have become just as brazen as their House brethren in shutting out competition. Critics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not -- it's wrong to blame Congress for the now nearly 100% re-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for. Michael Kinsley writes in the New Republic that if incumbents always win, it's because voters can't be bothered. That takes money, and skewed campaign finance laws combined with taxpayer-paid junk mail effectively mean that only incumbents have the cash to make themselves known and to be taken seriously by the media. The polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way they can control Congress effectively is by limiting terms. A big problem of the current system limiting Presidents but not Congress is that this means political power is constantly tipped in favor of the legislative branch. This fall, the group will try to get both incumbents and challengers to pledge they will not serve more than 12 years in office. As late as 1860, the average length of House service was four years. The opinion polls for term limitation show that the voters don't like the change.
