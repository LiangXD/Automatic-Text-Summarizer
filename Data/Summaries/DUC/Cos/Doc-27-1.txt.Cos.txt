The accidental shooting death of a young stockbroker by an officer looking for a burglar is one more strike against a police force already struggling with allegations of brutality and racism. It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year. Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens. Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, authorities said. An officer encountered Barnes, unarmed, in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, standing in his bedroom, police spokesman Sgt. Barnes made "a kind of lunging motion," and the officer fired from about 5 to 8 feet, Mills said. Police Chief Steven Bishop said before the latest slaying that the department's standing has fallen in the community, and a "behavior modification" program is being developed for offending officers. In June, several white officers bloodied a Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the ground. In May, another black clergyman was hit on the head with a shotgun by a white officer while lying on the ground. In another case, three undercover officers were suspended for a shooting this spring that left a young black man crippled. And an officer killed a man who was spraying him with a fire extinguisher. "This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr. Barnes' family and for this officer," Bishop said. "The officers were reacting appropriately to a number of circumstances which together led them to that apartment."
