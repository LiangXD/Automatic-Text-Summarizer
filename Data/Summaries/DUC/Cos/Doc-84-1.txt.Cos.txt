Drugs are now available that can put AIDS patients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a vaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel of AIDS experts said Saturday. Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that an epidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the inner cities. "We anticipate in our major cities losing two decades of progress in our tuberculosis control efforts," said Vermund. And unlike the AIDS virus, which cannot be transmitted through casual contact, tuberculosis is easily transmitted through the air. "I think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to the general population," Vermund said. Many of the cases of tuberculosis are occurring when individuals who were exposed to tuberculosis early in life contract AIDS. There is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have AIDS, but that is likely, Vermund said. He said the rise in tuberculosis began before the AIDS epidemic, probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the 1970s.
