But Labour's proposed minimum wage would only be positively harmful if, as the Tories claim, it will reduce employment. International evidence is a better source of clues on the likely effects of a UK minimum wage. The US, in particular, also has a large and highly competitive service sector employing many women and young people at relatively low wages. A recent study of the effect of extending the mainland minimum wage to Puerto Rico in 1974 found a more dramatic employment effect. By 1980 the federal minimum wage was 75 per cent of the average wage in Puerto Rico's manufacturing industry compared to 43 per cent on the mainland. Its unemployment rate rose from 11.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent between 1974 and 1983, of which over one third is estimated to be a direct result of the rise in the minimum wage. Yet a number of recent empirical studies of the effect of last year's rise in the US minimum wage fail to support this traditional view. Over half of the restaurants had to raise the lowest wage they paid by the full 45 cent increase in the minimum wage. On average, the restaurants that had to increase their wages by more tended also to have a larger increase in employment, as the right-hand chart shows. A 10 per cent wage increase is predicted to raise relative full-time employment by 25 per cent. One explanation is that fast-food restaurants can impose below-market wages on their existing employees but have to raise them to market rates in order to attract new employees.
