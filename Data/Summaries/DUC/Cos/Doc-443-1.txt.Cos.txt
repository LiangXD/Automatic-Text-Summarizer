Crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. Maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s. In the low veld, where rains have been below normal since 1989, sugar production has come to a halt, turning Zimbabwe from a substantial exporter into a net importer. At ZDollars 3.7bn (Pounds 410m) last year, agriculture accounted for almost 20 per cent of gross domestic product, though in real terms, it was 8 per cent below the mid-1980s peak. Following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, exports of farm produce in US dollar terms will be sharply lower, with tobacco earnings of less than USDollars 500m, compared with Dollars 520m in 1991 (28 per cent of total exports). After allowing for some reduction in other imports and higher exports of manufactures and some minerals, the balance of payments impact will exceed Dollars 300m - at the very least - pushing the current account deficit above Dollars 1bn, or 20 per cent of GDP. The traditional suppliers of maize to these countries - South Africa and Zimbabwe - will be importing up to 7m tonnes themselves this year (5m tonnes for South Africa and 2m tonnes for Zimbabwe). Compensatory funding will be available from the International Monetary Fund, but when this and other aid commitments are taken into account there is certain to be an unfilled gap in the region, which for Zimbabwe will mean diverting other aid funds and export earnings to pay for food. Zimbabwe's needs are put at about 2m tonnes of maize and 500,000 tonnes of wheat, sugar and other products, while Malawi will need at least 1m tonnes and Zambia more than 800,000 tonnes. The country's textile and clothing industry - the main exporter of manufactured goods - has warned of production cutbacks and lay-offs unless it is allowed to import cotton this year. The dairy sector, like maize, was in crisis before the drought, because of the government's producer price policy, which has pushed farmers into export crops (such as tobacco), horticulture and even game farming. At best, it will take the industry until 1994-95 to regain average production levels of the late 1980s, while the economy as a whole is unlikely to recover fully from the drought of 1992 for at least two years.
