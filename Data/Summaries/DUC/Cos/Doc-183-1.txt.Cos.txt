Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the Texas and Louisiana coasts Monday, a day in which the storm's winds capsized an oil drilling work vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside. Officials at the National Hurricane Service in Miami said the storm was expected to reach land some time this afternoon or evening. The best estimate Monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the western Louisiana or upper Texas coast. Meanwhile, coastal residents began what has long been a ritual along the Gulf Coast during hurricane season, which begins in late spring and runs through early fall. One particular concern in Houston was the possibility of major flooding should the city be on the wet, or eastern, side of the hurricane. Besides heavy rains and wind, the hurricane is expected to cause tides 5 to 7 feet above normal. Chantal is the third named storm since the beginning of the hurricane season June 1.
