In the type of leukemia suffered by the patients, white blood cells have turned malignant at an immature stage of cell development. This new concept of triggering cancer cells to mature and die contrasts with the conventional concept of chemotherapy, in which drugs simply poison malignant cells. The drug used in the experimental treatment is known as tretinoin, which belongs to a class of chemicals called retinoic acids that are related to vitamin A. It is an uncommon cancer, afflicting about 1,000 Americans a year, in which certain cells in the bone marrow become malignant before they have matured into fully functioning white blood cells. Most patients with promyleocytic leukemia apparently have the same defect in two of their 23 chromosomes, the structures in the cell that contain all the genes. This and other laboratory findings suggested that the immaturity of the leukemic white blood cells might somehow be related to a foul-up in the way the cells handled or failed to handle retinoic acid. But, he added, the U.S. group is the first to show that the drug works by triggering the immature cancer cells to mature, or to differentiate, in the biologists jargon.
