A form of blood cancer that strikes children appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the body's ability to make interferon, according to a study published today. The researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's production of interferon, a disease-fighting substance, may play a role in warding off the development of cancer. They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes. The production of two forms of interferon, known as alpha and beta-1, are controlled by two genes that are close together on chromosome 9 in the body's library of genes. However, they left open the possibility that some other gene in this region besides those that make interferon could also be the tumor-suppressing gene.
