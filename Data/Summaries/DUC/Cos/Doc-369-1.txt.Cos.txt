Robert H. Bork, who once hoped for a Supreme Court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court Monday. The Senate rejected Bork's nomination to the high court in 1987 after a bitter political battle. There were no references to that fight Monday as Bork engaged in debate with the justices and opposing lawyers over the complexities of federal banking law and related matters. Bork was only the sixth man this century to be denied a Supreme Court seat by the Senate and the 26th in its history.
