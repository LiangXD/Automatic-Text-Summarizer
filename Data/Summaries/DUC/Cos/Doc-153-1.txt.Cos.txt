Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today "in a complete state of shock," accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal. Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used a muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field. "Everybody uses drugs," said sprinter Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone. Two tests of Johnson's urine sample proved positive and his denials of drug use were rejected today. In a middle-of-the-night meeting with Olympic and Canadian officials, family members, coach and manager, Johnson, 26, forfeited his most prized possession, the medal he'd had in his hands for only three days. "Ben was not able to discuss or articulate anything at that moment... A few hours later, he fled to the airport and boarded a plane to New York's Kennedy International Airport. "This is a blow for the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement," said International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch. It's also a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians." "Ben is a great competitor and I hope he is able to straighten out his life and return to competition." Lewis has previously alleged widespread drug use in track and field.
