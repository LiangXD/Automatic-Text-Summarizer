But the silky steeliness displayed during the crisis by Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has revived discussion of moving Vice President Dan Quayle out to make room for the general on the 1992 Republican ticket.; Yet there is some evidence to suggest that if Powell ever decided to seek elected office, he might be at least as comfortable running as a Democrat.; No one, of course, can imagine Powell carrying the Democratic banner next year against President Bush, his commander-in-chief. But Powell's ultimate political fate does not now seem likely to be decided in the coming election.; It is true that many Republican strategists say nightly prayers for Bush to replace Quayle with Powell in 1992. And, as the general's career unfolds, Democrats should not assume his loyalties lie irrevocably with the GOP.; To begin with, no one knows Powell's political affiliation. Though he has prospered in Republican administrations, he also thrived in the Carter administration.; Publicly, Powell brushes aside all questions about his political ideology and ambitions. I can tell you, however, that proves how great his political skills are. ; As reticent as he is, though, Powell has publicly expressed views on enough foreign and domestic subjects to give some clues of his leanings. Nominating Powell to a future national ticket offers Republicans the chance to cement their presidential majority by breaking the Democratic hold on black votes.; For Democrats, conversely, a national slot for Powell could allow the party to simultaneously affirm its commitment to equal opportunity and dispatch persistent doubts about whether it is tough enough to protect American interests in an unstable world.; If Powell hints even the slightest interest, and Democrats are uncharacteristically alert, it could set off the kind of bipartisan bidding war not seen since 1948, when activists in both parties tried to draft Eisenhower as their presidential candidate.
