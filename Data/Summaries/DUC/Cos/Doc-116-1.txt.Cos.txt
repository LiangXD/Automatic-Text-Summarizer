Elizabeth Taylor suffered complications including new infections in her fifth week of hospitalization for pneumonia, and will remain hospitalized for about six more weeks, doctors said Friday. "She is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctors are pleased with her progress," Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam, said after talking to doctors. Earlier this week, Ms. Sam said the 58-year-old actress was improving and would be released from the hospital this week to recuperate at home. Miss Taylor was reportedly in one of the hospital's suites. Visitors throughout Miss Taylor's hospitalization included her four children, Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and Michael Wilding.
