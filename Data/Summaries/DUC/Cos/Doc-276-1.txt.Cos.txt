Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls. For example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections. Forcing senior members of a legislature to retire means that the new candidates who try to take their place will have to invest heavily in achieving the name recognition that the veterans already have. This will require large new infusions of money and electoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it. Term limitations won't improve the functioning of the legislature, either. Term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the relatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who surround them. Just the opposite, since they create an artificial barrier preventing voters from returning to office legislators they might otherwise favor. More likely, groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term limitations to improve their chances of winning office.
