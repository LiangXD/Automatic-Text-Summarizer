Gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the '50s and '60s, because of an apparent break in the periodic West African drought. The most intense hurricanes, Gray explains, usually form at low latitudes from tropical disturbances moving westward from Africa. Hurricanes are classified by the Saffir-Simpson scale, the fiercest a No. Last year's Gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across Jamaica and the Mexican Yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere. The strongest recorded storm on Earth, Zimmer says, was 1979 Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars. Outside the Atlantic area and the eastern Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons or cyclones. 5 hurricanes have struck the United States with full force, the 1935 Labor Day storm that ravaged the Florida Keys and 1969's Camille, which slammed ashore at Mississippi and Louisiana. If the future is like the past with its pattern of atmospheric conditions, there is a good probability of the return of stronger storms, Gray said. The threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any yet recorded, says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will, Emanuel explains.
