Through the years Mr. Gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing, in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime. The exchange sounded more like one gang challenging another than a police chief seeking to reduce conflict in the community. Similarly, Mr. Gates vehemently opposed the Police Corps Program backed by other police chiefs. Mr. Gates opposed the Police Corps because its members would not be professionals. Yet the presence of such non-professionals would discourage the racism and brutality exposed by the Rodney King beating. The presence of even one police corps officer witness would have deterred the criminal cops. Many chiefs openly disagreed with Mr. Gates when he opposed the Police Corps Bill in Congress. Mr. Gates's statement did nothing to lessen the tragedy of the fallen officer, but like his statement about blacks, it gave comfort to bigots within and outside the department. Two years ago, on a national television documentary, Mr. Gates defended a special unit that had shot many criminals during stakeouts. Last year Los Angeles paid $3 million to 52 residents of an apartment complex ransacked by police. Or was the chief suggesting that the beating was a warning against further run-ins with the police? Public opinion polls in Los Angeles show the majority of people believe police brutality is common, and they disapprove of the way Mr. Gates has done his job. When he characterizes such opposition as cop-haters, he embitters his department and to some extent all police. Mr. Gates's military style of policing is at odds with that in the rest of the country, and it's about time police leaders publicly repudiated it. It is hard to see how the Los Angeles Police Department can regain credibility unless Daryl Gates's leave becomes permanent. But the videotape of the LAPD brutality affects the credibility of all police officers.
