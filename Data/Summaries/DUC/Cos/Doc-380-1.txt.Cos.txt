A lie detector that measures brain waves would be more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says its developer. "If sensory information has a special meaning for you... then your brain will respond with a special kind of trough called the P3 wave," he said. "When they see terms like that, their brain waves break into P3 waves." "It's a perfectly valid way of detecting lies," said Sidney Weinstein, a professor of neurology at New York University College of Medicine in New York City and editor of the Danbury, Conn.-based neuroscience journal. However, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would need a great deal more training, Weinstein said.
