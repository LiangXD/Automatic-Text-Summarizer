Egypt honored its slain parliament speaker and four security men today with a state funeral led by a grim-looking President Hosni Mubarak. The government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination Friday of its second-highest official, Rifaat el-Mahgoub. He was the first Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot President Anwar Sadat at a military parade nine years ago. Hassan Abu-Basha, a former police minister, told the Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram he believed el-Mahgoub's slaying was the work of Iraqi agents. Hundreds of red-bereted military police and white-uniformed policemen sealed off all streets leading to the mosque where the religious service was held. They also lined the funeral procession route, as did hundreds of plainclothes security men. Symbolic units from the military services spearheaded the procession, followed by a military band and two dozen wreath-bearers. Behind them were four military jeeps carrying coffins of the four security men, draped in the red, white and black Egyptian flag. He said authorities arrested alleged saboteurs who were entering the country with orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to assassinate Egyptian officials. The state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram, quoting police sources, reported Monday that local Moslem extremists were collaborating with Palestinian terrorists sent to the country by Iraq on sabotage missions. Police ordered a state of alert at airports to keep the assailants from fleeing and set up security checkpoints along Cairo bridges. In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "We are shocked by the assassination of the Egyptian speaker.
