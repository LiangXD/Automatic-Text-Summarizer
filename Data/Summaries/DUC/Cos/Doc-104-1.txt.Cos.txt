Firefighters in California, Michigan, Montana, Wyoming and Utah battled holiday weekend fires which blackened more than 6,000 acres of forest and wilderness areas. Illegal fireworks were blamed for a blaze that swept over 2,200 rugged acres of Stanislaus National Forest in California, 10 miles west of Yosemite National Park. The fire, which began Saturday, was declared contained this morning, "We have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket," said Mary Hale, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry. In southern Utah's scenic Zion National Park, firefighters tried today to contain a 600-acre fire that was ignited by lightning June 19 but had been allowed to burn in a small area. A small contingent of firefighters who hiked into the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness on Monday in south-central Montana contained portions of a 2,000-acre fire that has been burning there since June 19, forest officials said. Forest Service policy allows wilderness fires to burn unless they threaten trails or structures, or threaten to burn outside the wilderness boundary. Phil Jaquith, Beartooth District ranger for the Custer National Forest, said the bulk of the fire on the east banks of the Stillwater River was not being suppressed. Firefighters concentrated on keeping the fire entering the Du Noir Special Management Area a few miles to the north, Damron said.
