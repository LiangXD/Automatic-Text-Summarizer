Ben Johnson spent his homecoming in seclusion, without the Olympic gold medal and the hero's welcome, as Canadians bemoaned the fate of the sprinter who failed the drug test. Returning to Canada on Tuesday, Johnson, 26, dodged reporters and the public, refusing to talk about the muscle-building and illegal steroid Stanzolol found in his system after he won the 100-meter dash as the world's fastest human. "I got nothing to hide," Johnson told The Boston Globe during the flight to New York, where he then boarded another plane for Canada. "It's not the only thing in life to win a gold medal," Johnson said. Stripped of the gold and banned for life from Canadian teams, Johnson cried in the back of a limousine that whisked him to his mother's home in suburban Toronto after the grueling trip from Seoul. "There's no gold now, just disappointment," said Boyd Plaxton, 26, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, one of 200 people on hand when Johnson's plane landed. Johnson spent the 1 hour, 40 minute flight from New York in the plane's cockpit to avoid reporters. On the way to New York, however, he stayed in the passenger cabin, appearing calm throughout the flight, the Globe said. Sports Minister Jean Charest said Johnson had tested negative for drugs in August and had passed eight tests in two years. Johnson's family and close friends also denied he took steroids "I know my son doesn't take drugs. I know it," said his father, Ben Johnson Sr., from Falmouth, Jamaica, in an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail. Johnson had dedicated his gold to his mother, Gloria, and the Canadian people. Police escorted a woman to the door of Johnson's mother's home so she could deliver a card with more than 1,000 signatures from Canadians "who sympathized with your personal devastation." "The last flicker of hope just died," said Danny Planetta, who was watching TV at a bar when he heard Monday night that Johnson had tested positive for steroids.
