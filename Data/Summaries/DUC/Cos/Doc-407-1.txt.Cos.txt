Groups of about 50 demonstrators staged sit-down strikes at about two dozen rail and road intersections in and around Dhaka, a city of 7 million people. Even bicycle-powered rickshaws, Dhaka's chief mode of transport, stayed off the streets. Protesters paraded through the streets shouting "Down with Ershad!" and "Days of Autocracy Are Over!" The blockade was the latest tactic in the campaign by opposition parties to force Ershad to quit. This shows popular support for our cause," said Suranjit Sengupta, a top leader of the Democratic Party. The opposition parties say they will boycott the vote unless Ershad resigns and hands over power to a caretaker government.
