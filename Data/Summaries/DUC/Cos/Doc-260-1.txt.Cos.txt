Two years ago, it looked as if a vast part of the nation's farm empire was burning up as drought and heat parched crops and livestock. It concentrated on the most severe drought region, centered in nine states of the Midwest and upper Great Plains. As used by the agency, net farm income includes gross income from farming during the calendar year, including federal payments, minus costs of production. The nine states studied as the "drought region" were Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. In the drought states, 62.2 percent of the farms were said to be in favorable financial position, compared with 62.8 percent in 1987. "Even with lower incomes, farmers in the drought region continued to improve their debt position (in relation to assets)," the report said. The report noted that higher market prices helped reduce the direct payments to farmers in 1988 under USDA's commodity programs. The Agriculture Department says inspectors are on guard against items that can carry Boophilus ticks into the United States. "This tick, which carries bovine babesiosis _ a serious cattle disease often called Texas cattle fever _ was eradicated from the United States in 1943," said James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
