Suspected communist rebels today killed the police chief of the Philippines' major financial center in an escalation of street violence sweeping the capital area, police said. Col. Herminio Taylo, 54, police chief of Makati, had just finished jogging and was buying fruit in a public market when two assassins opened fire with.45-caliber pistols, police said. Makati, a twin city of Manila with a population of about 440,000, is the country's major banking and financial center and is also the home of numerous foreign embassies. President Corazon Aquino deplored the latest killing but said public officials must learn to live with the threat of assassination. "It is really very unfortunate and I do sympathize with the family of Col. Taylo," said Mrs. Aquino, whose husband Benigno was slain in a political assassination in 1983. "And I hope that this, perhaps, could be a reminder to all our people in the military and police that they should take necessary precautions to ward off these assasination attempts." National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto said the killing of Taylo showed that every soldier and policeman was a potential target of assassination.
