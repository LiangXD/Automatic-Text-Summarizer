The National Hurricane Center said that as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this year, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal. Atlantic hurricanes form from especially strong tropical storms that are triggered by winds and other air disturbances that sweep across Africa. Comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel with the number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Mr. Gray found a striking correlation. From 1947 to 1969, for instance, rainfall in the western Sahel was especially abundant, and during this time there were 13 severe hurricanes that formed in the Atlantic Ocean. From 1970 to 1988, the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought, and hurricane activity was unusually low; only one severe hurricane, Gloria in 1985, formed in the area. Hurricane activity was much higher during this time than during intervals when the Sahel was dry.
