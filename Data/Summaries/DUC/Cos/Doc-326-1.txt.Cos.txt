In response to questions about Mr. Sununu's recent shift to use of corporate jets in the wake of restrictions imposed last month on his use of government planes, the White House released the list of five jets the chief of staff has used for travel to fund-raisers. Boyden Gray's office approved all the travel in advance, and he vetoed some suggested corporate jets because of potential conflicts of interest, White House officials said. Use of corporate jets for political travel is legal provided the corporation is reimbursed for providing the ride or reports the travel as an in-kind political contribution. Mr. Sununu used a jet provided by three individual owners -- identified by the White House as Howard Bender, Martin Bender and John Mason -- to travel to a Chicago fund-raiser June 11. The next day, as previously reported, Mr. Sununu used a jet provided by Beneficial Corp., a financial management and planning concern, to return from a fund-raiser for the New Jersey state party. But Mr. Bush, who spoke to reporters before a White House meeting as Mr. Sununu sat nearby, also seemed to suggest that he would like his chief of staff to avoid creating new travel controversies.
