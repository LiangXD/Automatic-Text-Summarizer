THE effects of widespread drought on grain production in South Africa could negate the expected recovery in economic growth in the second half of the year, Mr Kraai van Niekerk, the country's agriculture minister, said yesterday. The United Nations Food and Agriculture organisation said hot and dry conditions in January and February were expected to reduce the total cereal harvest in 11 southern African countries to 16m tonnes, 25 per cent down on the average. Total food imports for the region could be as high as 6m tonnes, three times more than in a normal year.
