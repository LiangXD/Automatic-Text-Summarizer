Yet organized labor, which constantly asserts its interest in job creation, has made a strong pitch for the Kennedy-Hawkins Minimum Wage Restoration Act, a bill that would head the minimum wage upward once more. Worst news of all, Labor Secretary William Brock appears ready to compromise away President Reagan's soundly based opposition to the minimum wage. A more candid union argument holds that increases in the minimum raises wage scales generally, but the truth of that is doubtful too. At any rate, a study commission appointed by Jimmy Carter estimated in a 1981 report that every 10% increase in the minimum wage cost the economy 80,000 to 200,000 entry-level jobs. Kennedy-Hawkins proposes raising the minimum wage to $4.65 by 1990 from today's $3.35, and, more damaging, tying the minimum wage in future to the average wage for all non-supervisory private employees. Secretary Brock in June suggested the administration might go along with this scheme if youths are exempted and the indexing plan is dropped. Senator Dan Quayle, a Republican, has calculated that two Democratic projects, the minimum-wage increase proposed for 1989 and mandatory health coverage, would add $1.49 an hour more to wage costs at the bottom of the income scale. The absence of the minimum-wage constraint on the ability of these extra earners to find jobs has relieved poverty, not increased it. Secretary Brock has said he won't concede on anything in the Kennedy package that will create job loss.
