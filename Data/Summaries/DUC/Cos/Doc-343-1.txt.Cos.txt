The Trans-Antarctica Expedition Mr. Steger writes about in Crossing Antarctica (Knopf, 304 pages, $25) was born of the ambitions of Mr. Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne, who met in 1986 in the middle of separate arctic journeys. Mr. Steger was leading the first confirmed unsupported dog-sled expedition to the North Pole and Dr. Etienne was making the first solo ski there. They met in Mr. Steger's tent, shared tea and their Antarctic dreams and exchanged phone numbers. Steger and Etienne decided to ski and dog-sled across the continent by the longest possible route, a trek that took them from July 27 until March 3. None of that bothered Mr. Steger, who was more interested in Mr. Qin's fierce determination to share camp chores and pull his weight in subzero cold. Dahe will do well, Mr. Steger decided, a judgment vindicated over 3,741 miles in windchills sometimes approaching minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Mr. Steger is also a keen judge of dogs, who share equally in the credit for Trans-Antarctica. Storms slowed them early and confined them to their tents for days on the Antarctic Peninsula and buried some food caches irretrievably under drifts of snow, gravely imperiling the expedition. Trans-Antarctica faced such problems with a different style than Amundsen, Scott, Ernest Shackleton and explorers who traveled in an age when leaders gave orders and the rest followed. Amundsen consulted his teammates but his leadership was authoritarian, and the Scott expedition followed Royal Navy traditions of command. As polar literature, Mr. Steger's account, written with Jon Bowermaster, cannot equal the technical fascination of Amundsen's The South Pole. Nor can it approach the tragic drama of Apsley Cherry-Garrard's The Worst Journey in the World, which recounts the death of Scott's party after much agony only 11 miles from a cache of food and fuel.
