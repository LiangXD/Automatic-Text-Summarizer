A poor ventilation system that does little more than recycle old, stale air from one end of the building to another.; Millions of American office workers are getting more than they bargained for when they inhale in a building that has no fresh air. Along with oxygen, they may be getting flu and other infectious bugs from their co-workers.; That's because, in today's modern office buildings, recirculated air can mean recycled flu and other airborne infections. The evidence comes from various studies of tuberculosis, measles and flu that spread in a manner that can only be explained by poor air ventilation.; Modern office buildings are tight, says Jon Rosenberg, public health officer in California's occupational health program. If it has a good ventilation system... you don't necessarily have to have a sick building, Rosenberg says.; But, alas, many modern ventilation systems recirculate indoor air with little or no fresh air. People who had no direct contact with this case, might have been exposed in far reaches of the building. ; If tuberculosis can spread in poorly ventilated buildings, so can other infectious bugs. In those tight buildings, they continue to recirculate it, and they probably build up. ; Nardell and others recognize that the solution to this problem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air -- can be expensive. There's going to be a price of living together in a communal society. ; YOU'RE INTERESTEDEmployees who think that poor air quality at their workplace is contributing to health problems can call Cal-OSHA, a state agency that monitors worker safety and health.
