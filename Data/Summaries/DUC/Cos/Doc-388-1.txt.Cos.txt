The USS Vincennes' destruction of an Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake organization said Sunday. "On the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the captain acted the best way he knew how," said William E. Brooks Jr., publisher of the Vincennes Sun-Commercial newspaper and a member of the USS Vincennes Association. "The other thing, in my opinon, this is the other side of the Stark incident," Brooks said, referring to the May 1987 Iraqi jet attack on the U.S. missile frigate Stark, which cost 37 American lives. "If the captain had stayed there and not done anything, we might have been reading about loss of life on the Vincennes," Brroks said. It was the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of Vincennes. The association's 500 members meet annually in Vincennes to reminisce about their years of service and pay tribute to the dead, said Vincennes liaison officer and honorary member, Bill Toth, 64. "There's no way of rectifying this kind of situation, so all we can do is remember these people," Toth said. "Our prayers and those of the commuity are with the ship's commander and crew members." "From what I've heard about the ship, it's like everybody on it is family and they're trying to be the best in the Navy," Toth said.
