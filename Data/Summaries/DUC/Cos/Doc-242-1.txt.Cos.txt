An official statement issued Friday confirmed that federal military commanders met in March and considered ways to quell dissent in Slovenia. The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followed reports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina that there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic. The ministry statement said the federal military council met on March 25 and concluded that "dissident tendencies" in Slovenia were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's Communist government. It said the police disputed the military council's conclusion at a later meeting between the republic's police authorities and Ljubljana's military command. Slovenia's Communist Party presidium also "expressed disagreement with part of the military council's opinions," said the statement. The plan was blocked by Kucan and Stane Dolanc, Slovenia's member in Yugoslavia's collective presidency, after they were told about it by Slovenian security organizations, the letter said.
