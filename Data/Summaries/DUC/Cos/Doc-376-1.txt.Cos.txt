A major earthquake rumbled through the jungles of southern Sudan on Sunday near the war-torn region's largest city, but officials said there appeared to be no casualties and little damage. But much of the area affected by the quake is so isolated that any news might take days or weeks. Juba, southern Sudan's largest city, is 60 miles southwest of the quake's reported epicenter. In Nairobi, Kenya, Bob Koepp, a Lutheran World Federation official, said a pilot flying relief supplies to Juba returned late Sunday and said the city had not been seriously affected. Scientists said the quake's epicenter was 700 miles south of Sudan's capital, Khartoum. Relief workers in two rebel-controlled villages, Bor and Torit, apparently told officials in Nairobi, Kenya, the earthquake caused no damage there. A crew with Koepp's organization landed in the region with relief supplies two hours after the quake struck at 4:22 a.m. and reported seeing nothing amiss. Egypt's two principal earthquake monitoring stations, including one at the Aswan High Dam, 600 miles south of Cairo and just north of the Sudan border, recorded the quake at 7.5 on the Richter scale. A magnitude of 7 is considered a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage. Magnitude 8 is a great earthquake capable of tremendous damage. Kebeasy, an expert on earthquakes of northeastern Africa, said the epicenter was just west of the Great African Rift. That earthquake zone stretches 4,000 miles from Mozambique through the Red Sea to Lebanon.
