There have only been 35 editions of this race run without him.; The last three Boston marathons have turned into reckless speed duels. They have produced five of the top 10 times and eight of the top 15 in the race's storied history.; They also have resulted in a race of attrition, with many of the early speedsters burning out completely or faltering in the late stages.; Along the historic route that begins in Hopkinton, west of Boston, and ends in Copley Square in the Back Bay section of the city, checkpoint records have fallen at an alarming rate.; For example, all 11 checkpoint records were shattered through the first 20 miles last year, either by Simon Robert Naali or Juma Ikangaa, both of Tanzania.
