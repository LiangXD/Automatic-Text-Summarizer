In Hawaii, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in six years, stunning scientists by releasing a dazzling fountain of lava at the height of the eclipse.; And in the Bay Area, more than half the sun was covered when the eclipse peaked at 11:20 a.m. The world will not see such a long-lasting eclipse for another 151 years.; Few people who saw it today will forget The Big One. ; It looks neat. In the 160-mile-wide swath from Hawaii to Baja to Mexico to Brazil, the morning turned into night -- the only region where the eclipse made the Earth totally dark.; Clouds obscured eclipse; As totality arrived at sea level on the Big Island, the sun was hidden by a cloud layer. Their hopes had fallen and risen in the previous hour as the clouds came and went.; I came especially for this, and hope we get to see it, said Margaret MacLeod, a mathematics and science teacher from Manhattan Beach shortly before the eclipse in Hawaii. If we don't get to see it, I may have to go to Iraq for the next one. ; Because of the clouds, most were unable to see the stages of the eclipse until it got totally dark.; In the Bay Area, though, mostly sunny skies made eclipse watching a treat, except along the coast, where it was obscured by fog.; Parks, parking lots, shopping centers, back yards and planetariums became Eclipsefests as the peak approached.; More than a hundred sun gazers showed up at the Branham Lane Park in south San Jose with almost as many gizmos to help them spot sunspots and watch the moon cross the sun.; There were funny Mylar glasses, big pinhole cameras, small pinhole cameras, welder's glass, welder's masks, binoculars projecting images onto cardboard and telescopes.; None was as impressive as Ralph Reeves' interference birefrigent hydrogen alpha filter telescope.
