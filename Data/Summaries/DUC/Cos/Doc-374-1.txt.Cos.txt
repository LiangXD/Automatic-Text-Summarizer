A major earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter scale struck off northeastern Honshu Island early today, officials said. After the quake, officials closed the major expressway through the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were stopped to check the condition of the rails. The agency said the quake had a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale, the same as the Oct. In Washington, the U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured 7.3 on the Richter scale. The main earthquake was the strongest in that region in more than 58 years, since a magnitude 7.7 earthquake March 9, 1931, said Don Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. agency. The strongest of the earlier quakes was a magnitude 6.5 on Sunday. A 7 reading is a "major" earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a "great" quake, capable of tremendous damage.
