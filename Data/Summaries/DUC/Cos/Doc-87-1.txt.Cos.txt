Tuberculosis has become the world's deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday. It estimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis. These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people had thought that tuberculosis had gone away, said Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor of microbiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and a consultant to the United Nations. Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease of the lungs and other organs caused by a bacterium transmitted through the air when infected people cough or sneeze. An individual does not have to have a damaged immune system to contract an active case of tuberculosis. In many places, more than half the beds in medical wards are patients with tuberculosis, Bloom said. But if they're not treated for tuberculosis, those people will be spreading the disease (tuberculosis) in their communities. In the United States, public health officials began to recognize about five years ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was making a surprising comeback as a result of the AIDS epidemic. Effective drugs to combat tuberculosis cost about $30 to $50 per person, given over six months.
