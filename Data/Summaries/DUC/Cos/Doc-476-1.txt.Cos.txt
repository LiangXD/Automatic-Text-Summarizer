At the same time, if a state's minimum is higher than the federal minimum, the state minimum applies. Furthermore, the District of Columbia, like many states, has a subminimum, or training wage, of $3.35 for employees in some job categories who are under age 18. Moreover, 13 states have minimums below the federal level and nine have no minimum at all. Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05. A minimum wage of $5.05 would require even the high-minimum-wage states of California and Connecticut to increase their mandated minimums by 19%. Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living. California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages. Compare these unemployment rates to those of Alabama and Louisiana, states that have no minimum wage. Proponents of a federal increase argue that recent state increases signal grassroots support of the current minimum-wage bill before Congress. As Robert Martin of the Chamber of Commerce has pointed out: Most states recognize that what you pay someone is determined by supply and demand.
