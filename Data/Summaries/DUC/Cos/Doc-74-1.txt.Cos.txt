A B-52 bomber crashed and burst into flames early today on a runway while practicing "touch-and-go" landings at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, officials said. The plane, normally equipped to carry nuclear bombs, crashed about 1:15 a.m., said Lt. The crew was practicing landings after a seven-hour training flight when it crashed during one of its touch-and-go approaches, Peck said. All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman. Members of the crew suffered broken bones, but no one was burned, said Capt. Mark Hartney, 29, an aircraft commander from Mulberry, Fla.; 1st Lt. William R. Kroeger, 52, an instructor pilot from Fountain Hills, Ariz.; and 1st Lt. Hartney was the aircraft commander, but Debruzzi also was qualified to fly the plane, Bailey said. The accident was classified as the most serious kind, and all aircraft exercises at Sawyer were canceled even though runways other than the one where the crash occurred remained open, Bailey said. Peck said a board of officers will investigate the accident, adding weather did not appear to be a factor in the crash.
