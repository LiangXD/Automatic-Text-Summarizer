Two days of racially charged hearings on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds. "There's been no demonstrable change on the part of white leadership in this city to end racism," said Bob Starks, associate professor of inner city studies at Northeastern Illinois University. Daley is filling the remaining two years of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he died in November 1987. "I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago," Daley said. At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs. Among them was a 55-year-old grandmother, Callie Bryant, who testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police officers who gave her "the sign of the Ku Klux Klan." The poice department's record was defended by Police Superintendent LeRoy Martin, a black appointee of Washington.
