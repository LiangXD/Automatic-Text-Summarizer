No injuries were reported, said Petty Officer Brian Lincoln, of the U.S. Coast Guard's Miami office. "All we know is that the ship's captain... is completely out of fire-fighting equipment and has requested additional fire-fighting equipment such as foam, water and CO2," said Lincoln, referring to carbon dioxide. Coast Guard cutters, the Canada Star cruise ship and the vessel Vera Cruz stood by to assist in evacuating passengers, Lincoln said.
