GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insurance claims arising from Hurricane Andrew could 'cost it as much as Dollars 40m.' What this means is that GA is able to pass on its losses to external reinsurers once a certain claims threshold has been breached. Their guess is that losses to be faced by all insurers may total more than Dollars 8bn. However, other insurers have estimated that losses could be as low as Dollars 1bn in total.
