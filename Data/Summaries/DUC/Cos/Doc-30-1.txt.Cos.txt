Gates also wouldn't comment.; Mayor Tom Bradley, who has asked Gates to step down, said through a spokesman he believed the report focused on police management, excessive force and civilian control.; Sources familiar with testimony and evidence presented to the panel told the Los Angeles Times that a number of racially derogatory messages sent on police car computer terminals have been cataloged.; One message, for which no context was provided, read: It's monkey slapping time. ; The commission examined 90,000 pages of computer messages and found examples of racially and sexually offensive remarks scattered throughout. In one section encompassing several thousand messages, 260 such remarks were discovered, one source said.; In the days after the March 3 nightstick beating of Rodney G. King, the Police Department released transcripts of computer messages that one of the officers at the scene sent to a another officer. The Police Commission consists of five civilians appointed by the mayor.; The chief has civil-service protection and can be removed only by the Police Commission for misconduct.; Geoffrey Taylor Gibbs, who sits on the board of John M. Langston Bar Association, which represents about 900 African American lawyers, said black and Latino neighborhoods are depending on the commission to confirm their view that the white, male-dominated Police Department has subjected them to years of brutality and ignored their complaints.; People are looking to the commission, said Gibbs.
