Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the assistance of a ventilator after undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said Monday. The Academy Award-winning actress was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica last week for treatment of the pneumonia, and was listed in serious condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit on Monday, her doctors said in a prepared statement. She is seriously ill and on Sunday underwent a lung biopsy to further determine the cause of her pneumonia, the physicians' statement said. The statement provided no additional details of Taylor's condition, and hospital officials declined to comment beyond the statement. Lisa del Favero, a New York City publicist for Taylor, said the actress is seriously ill, but she's not on her deathbed. Taylor's doctors expect to have results of the biopsy by Thursday, she said. If you don't know what the trouble is, you grab a biopsy and study it, because that's where the problem is, Mohler explained. Emphasizing that he has no personal familiarity with the actress's case, Mohler said he does not blame her doctors for being conservative. Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist, said in a statement last week that Taylor had pneumonia and was being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized (indefinitely).
