A bill signed into law Monday by President Reagan will sharply restrict employers' use of polygraph tests. Currently, about two million U.S. workers annually take such tests when applying for jobs or when companies are investigating theft or other employee violations. 27, bars pre-hiring polygraph screening and random testing, and it sets strict rules about giving the tests to workers suspected of a particular wrongdoing. Because of the new law, employers who have relied heavily on lie detectors will have to resort to such alternatives as written tests that are designed to gauge a person's honesty, and background checks of job applicants -- something that critics of polygraphs say they should have been doing in the first place. Managers and other white-collar workers in the securities industry have been subject to polygraph tests where circumstances warrant, the trade group says, adding that the decision to test hinges on the employee's access to negotiable instruments, currency or securities -- not on the employee's rank. While he was chairman of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, John Shad testified in a congressional hearing on polygraph testing that brokerage houses need to keep using lie detectors to protect trillions of dollars of securities. Widespread polygraph testing of bank workers and executives will also be curtailed. Mr. Kaufman asserts that even the use of lie-detector tests when there has been a theft, which will still be permitted under the new law, will end because employers will have to do such things as give an employee a written statement to the effect that he is reasonably suspected of stealing. Some critics of polygraph testing say a major problem with lie detectors is that a conscientious but easily upset truth teller could show the quickened pulse, faster breathing, increased blood pressure and skin reactions that a polygraph typically measures. Polygraph testing and scoring methods currently used in personnel screening have never been shown to be valid tests of truthfulness, said John F. Beary, an assistant dean at Georgetown University School of Medicine, in recent testimony before Congress for the American Medical Association. While polygraph specialists say the devices can achieve 90% accuracy, critics contend that the accuracy rate can be as low as 25% and that a tough-minded liar can often control himself well enough to pass the test. One banker who will be glad of the new restrictions is Peter Persaud, who says he was denied a job as a vice president of Amerifirst Bank in Miami after twice flunking polygraph tests early this year. Other employees, too, cite problems arising from polygraph tests. Michael Darby, a former manager of a Zale Corp. jewelry store in Duluth, Ga., says that after Zale had a theft problem in an Atlanta store in 1986, the company gave lie detector tests to all of its employees. Zale's policy, a spokeswoman explains, is to do very selective polygraph testing during an investigation of suspected theft or loss. The bill to ban most polygraph tests was widely backed by civil-liberties groups, labor unions and Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, as well as by such organizations as the AMA and the American Psychological Association.
