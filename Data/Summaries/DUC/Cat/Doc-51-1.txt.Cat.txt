Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982. Since then, my passion really went up, said Fujita, a professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes for 42 years and is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the violent storms. Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research. Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953, partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country. Tornadoes are very rare in Japan, Fujita said. But Fujita has helped define the conditions most likely to spawn them. Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado. He also developed the Fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes. But Fujita considers his work on other air movements called downbursts and microbursts among his most significant achievements. Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, but are more dangerous because they give pilots less time to react, Fujita said. The National Transportation Safety Board has cited microbursts, a term coined by Fujita, as the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in the last 15 years, causing 577 fatalities. Fujita's work helped persuade the Federal Aviation Administation to begin installing a new radar system at 47 major airports beginning in the early 1990s. Fujita retires from teaching this year, but will continue his research at the university.
