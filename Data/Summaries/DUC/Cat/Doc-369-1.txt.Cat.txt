Robert H. Bork, who once hoped for a Supreme Court seat, instead stood before the nation's highest court Monday. There were no references to that fight Monday as Bork engaged in debate with the justices and opposing lawyers over the complexities of federal banking law and related matters. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who occupies the seat that eluded Bork, directed a few questions at Bork. Bork was only the sixth man this century to be denied a Supreme Court seat by the Senate and the 26th in its history.
