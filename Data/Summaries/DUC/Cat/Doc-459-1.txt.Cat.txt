CHINA stepped up the war of words over the future of Hong Kong yesterday, threatening to ignore the results of democratic elections proposed by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, once it assumes control in 1997. Mr Lu Ping, China's senior official for Hong Kong affairs, said that if Mr Patten pressed ahead with his democratic reforms Beijing would start a 'new kitchen' in 1997 - a Chinese expression which means making a fresh start. The remarks by Mr Lu, head of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, were greeted with relief by the Hong Kong stock market, which had been bracing itself for a more uncompromising stand. Mr Lu said China would have to make preparations ahead of 1997 for the cancellation of Mr Patten's proposed democratic reforms; but he stopped short of saying China would set up an alternative administration in Hong Kong before the end of British rule. He also refrained from repeating economic threats made by China last year, although it seems unlikely that Britain will win China's agreement to complete Hong Kong's Dollars 175bn (Pounds 123bn) airport project, or further develop the colony's container port. In Hong Kong, Mr Patten reiterated his preparedness to hold talks with China about his proposed 1994-95 elections.
