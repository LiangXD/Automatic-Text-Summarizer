Actress Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized with pneumonia, was listed as stable Thursday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, her publicist said. Miss Taylor, 58, hospitalized with a sinus infection April 9 at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, was transferred to St. John's on Monday because of a persistent fever and pneumonia. "She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized," Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist treating Miss Taylor, said in a statement Tuesday. Miss Taylor's health problems started with a fall from a horse when she was 13 and filming the movie "National Velvet."
