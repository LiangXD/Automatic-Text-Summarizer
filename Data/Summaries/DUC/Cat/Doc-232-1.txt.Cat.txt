His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs, and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico. The White House has taken its own polls and remains convinced that President Bush's support for Nafta is a winning issue. Although many working class Hispanic Americans believe Nafta would cost jobs, the Latino business organisations cautiously support the pact. Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congress to vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Nafta approved by Congress this year. Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as a weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to Mexico. 'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if they don't send a complete package in these three areas, the Congressional Democrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn't matter,' said Mr Freeman. In the Senate, Nafta is threatened by a resolution introduced by Senator Don Riegle, which would permit Congress to amend the agreement in five areas.
