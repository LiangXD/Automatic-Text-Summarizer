An experimental cancer drug that works after a single round of treatment appears to be the most effective medicine yet for a rare form of leukemia, according to a study. The drug _ called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA _ has produced complete remissions in almost all hairy cell leukemia patients treated, and none has relapsed so far. Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it "may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia." It, like hairy cell leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells, which produce disease-fighting antibodies. Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed in recent years.
