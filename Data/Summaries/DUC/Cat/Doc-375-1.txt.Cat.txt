Two of the plates sink beneath the islands of Japan and then collide again as they plunge deep into the Earth directly below Tokyo, setting the stage for catastrophic earthquakes that have destroyed the city in the past and could well do so again in the future. </P> <P> Most other earthquake-prone regions, including California, only have to worry about two colliding plates. </P> <P> The threat will get worse in the years ahead because more and more land is being reclaimed from Tokyo Bay to serve the needs of millions more who are flocking to a city already strangling on its own prosperity. Scientists are concerned that land reclaimed from the bay will be particularly hazardous because such soils amplify shock waves from earthquakes. </P> <P> Painfully aware of its problems, Japan is moving full speed ahead in earthquake engineering research, and the country is trying to develop the world's best earthquake warning system before the next great quake hits. Frank Press, president of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, has speculated that a great quake here would force Japan to reclaim much of its foreign investment, possibly leading to a collapse of the world economy. </P> <P> Tokyo was leveled once, in 1923, when a monstrous earthquake destroyed a city that had ignored the lessons offered in 1906 from a different city by a distant bay. If we had understood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the damages from the Great Kanto Earthquake which came just 17 years later could have been avoided, says Hirokazu Iemura of Kyoto University's Earthquake Engineering Laboratory. </P> <P> Iemura, who toured the Bay Area after last October's quake, is afraid history may repeat itself. The Bay Area quake suggested that Tokyo too may be much more vulnerable than experts had thought. </P> <P> For this and other reasons, Tokyo, most experts agree, has much to worry about. </P> <P> A study last year by Japan's National Land Agency concluded that if a great earthquake -- magnitude 8 or greater -- should strike Tokyo in the middle of the night it would kill about 80,000 people. And now, all these years later, Iemura and many other experts in Japan are afraid that history may repeat itself. </P> <P> We are very afraid of fire, said Etsuzo Shima, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo and one of Japan's leading earthquake experts. The modern buildings of Japan are among the best engineered in the world, and even many older structures are well built because earthquakes here are so much a part of life. </P> <P> But no amount of planning can reduce the geological hazard that lies beneath Tokyo. </P> <P> This is a very complex place, said Yoshimitsu Okada, who is in charge of the most ambitious effort in the world to predict an earthquake. Okada directs a research team that hopes to predict a major quake about 100 miles south of Tokyo in time to evacuate several crowded cities. </P> <P> Okada knows the quake will come some day because the geological formations beneath Japan are constantly active. </P> <P> The Earth's crust is made up of giant tectonic plates that drift around the planet. Shock waves striking the bedrock are reflected back up toward the surface, extending the life of the earthquake. </P> <P> The duration of the shaking is very long, said Oyagi, of the National Research Center for Disaster Prevention. </P> <P> Officials here know those conditions could add up to disaster for Tokyo, a belief that was reinforced by Kyoto University's Iemura when he returned from his tour of the San Francisco Bay Area after the Oct. He has concluded that Japan still has much to learn from San Francisco as well as Mexico City, which was ravaged by a 7.9 earthquake in 1985 that killed about 9,500 people and caused $3 billion in damages. </P> <P> Most experts here had thought that Mexico City was an exceptional case, Iemura said. Is that also a special case? </P> <P> Although he thinks the question needs more study, Iemura is troubled by the fact that much of Tokyo is built on areas similar to San Francisco's Marina District. </P> <P> And like San Francisco, Tokyo is extremely short of land on which to build the high rises needed to house the millions who continue to flock to this crowded city. </P> <P> The answer to the land shortage, Japanese authorities have concluded, is to reclaim more land from Tokyo Bay -- a prospect that deeply troubles many experts. Many of the new structures going up in Tokyo these days are built on filled land, and some people here hope someday to fill in the entire bay, making room for even more people and more buildings. </P> <P> If San Francisco was not an exceptional case, that trend could prove disastrous, many experts believe. </P> <P> Tokyo University's Shima believes there is only one answer, and that is to reverse the flow of people into Tokyo. </P> <P> One group is proposing that the capital be moved out of Tokyo, hoping that the forced move of government workers will result in a lower death toll when the quake hits. The Japanese government has put a ceiling of around $60,000 on each private residence in a city where a humble abode costs 10 times that amount. </P> <P> And Tokyo is a major nerve center in the fragile network that constitutes the global economy. </P> <P> Next: Preparing for The Big One </P> <P> DANGEROUS INTERSECTION </P> <P> Japan ranks among the most geologically active regions in the world. The Pacific and the Philippine Sea plates are being forced under the Eurasia Plate, and the two subducting plates collide directly beneath Tokyo. </P> <P> That dynamic process is why the region is capable of generating catastrophic earthquakes, like the temblor that destroyed Tokyo in 1923, as well as about 1,000 smaller quakes every month. </P>
