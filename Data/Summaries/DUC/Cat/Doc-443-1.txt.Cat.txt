Crop production has been devastated, with the exception of drought-resistant tobacco, where output has risen 6 per cent to 180m kg. Maize deliveries to the state-owned grain marketing board will fall by 90 per cent this year to 60,000 tonnes, from more than 600,000 tonnes last year and an annual average of more than 1m tonnes in the late 1980s. Cotton deliveries are forecast at less than 90,000 tonnes, down from 205,000 tonnes in 1991, soyabeans at 30,000 tonnes (133,000 tonnes last year), while winter wheat production is expected to fall to less than a third of normal levels. At ZDollars 3.7bn (Pounds 410m) last year, agriculture accounted for almost 20 per cent of gross domestic product, though in real terms, it was 8 per cent below the mid-1980s peak. Flue-cured tobacco accounts for just over half of this, and while there is likely to be some modest growth in the value of its output this year, the rest, with the exceptions of beef and horticulture will fall catastrophically; so much so that, in real terms, farm output in 1992 is projected to slump to its lowest levels for 30 years. Following last year's 45 per cent devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, exports of farm produce in US dollar terms will be sharply lower, with tobacco earnings of less than USDollars 500m, compared with Dollars 520m in 1991 (28 per cent of total exports). The collapse of sugar, cotton, and maize exports and reduced foreign earnings from coffee and tea will cost the country at least Dollars 150m (10 per cent of exports) over the next 12 months. At the same time, the country will need to import at least Dollars 350m worth of maize, wheat, sugar and possibly, later in the year, dairy products. Zimbabwe's needs are put at about 2m tonnes of maize and 500,000 tonnes of wheat, sugar and other products, while Malawi will need at least 1m tonnes and Zambia more than 800,000 tonnes. The country's textile and clothing industry - the main exporter of manufactured goods - has warned of production cutbacks and lay-offs unless it is allowed to import cotton this year. Next year's crop and livestock production will remain below average - even if good rains fall - as early plantings will be reduced because of a lack of irrigation. At best, it will take the industry until 1994-95 to regain average production levels of the late 1980s, while the economy as a whole is unlikely to recover fully from the drought of 1992 for at least two years.
