Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., in the Democrats' response, said that quiring welfare recipients work may be necessary, but he said such requirements should be controlled by state and local welfare officials, not the federal government. "Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old common sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work," the president said. "Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform," the president said. "If Congress presents me with a bill that replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of self-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans on welfare, I will use my veto pen." The House bill, with training and education programs as well as health and child-care benefits, would make welfare parents who work better off than those who do not, said Downey, acting chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance and unemployment compensation. "Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary, but those requirements should be controlled by state and local officials who administer our welfare programs, not federal bureaucrats," Downey said.
