The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season had more storms than usual and some forecasters predict that's just a hint of more frequent and more forceful hurricanes in the coming years. But Gray and other forecasters agree that the general outlook for the 1990s and the early years of the next century is for more intense hurricanes than those of the last two decades. Hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic every month except April, but are rare outside the hurricane season, June 1 to Nov. 30. In this year's season, there were 14 named storms, eight of them hurricanes. The most deadly storm was Hurricane Diana, which swept into Mexico in early August, resulting in flash floods and mudslides that killed 96 people and caused extensive damage to roads, property and agriculture, the weather service reported. Storms become hurricanes if winds reach 74 mph.
