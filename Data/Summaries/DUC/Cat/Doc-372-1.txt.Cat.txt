The earthquake that killed 25,000 people in Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many, the U.S. Geological Survey reports. The estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an additional 2,000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around the world, the Survey reported Monday. In addition to the deaths, some 13,000 people were injured and more than a half-million were left homeless in the Armenian earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale. The main shock was followed within minutes by a second, measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energy released by an earthquake. Last year's second most deadly earthquake occurred Aug. That earthquake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale, destroyed thousands of homes and injured many people. 6 an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730 lives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma and China, the Geological Survey reported. The Survey said it recorded 61 significant earthquakes last year, 15 fewer than the year before. An earthquake is considered significant if it has a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale. Three significant earthquakes were recorded in the United States last year, including the strongest shock of the year. The only U.S. earthquake death last year occured when someone suffered a heart attack after an earthquake measuring 4.8 in Whittier, Calif., in February. Europe recorded three earthquake deaths last year when one rated at 3.0 killed a group of miners in Czechoslovakia on Sept. And Japan, usually very seismically active, recorded only one significant earthquake last year, the Survey reported.
