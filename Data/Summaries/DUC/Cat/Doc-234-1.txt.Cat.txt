The site of the signing ceremony in Sacramento sent a warning to the city's congressman, Mr Bob Matsui, one of the leading proponents of Nafta in the US House of Representatives. In Washington state, Nafta opponents wrote alternative menus for a dinner given for Mr Rufus Yerxa, the Deputy US Trade Representative. With just a shoestring budget - no more than Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 134,230) a year in cash - foes of Nafta have worked for three years to mount a massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the American public. Nafta foes have pooled their meagre resources to provide him with a campaign office, and field legislative directors. Nafta foes around the country say their protests have persuaded congressman to back away from support of the deal. According to Mr Craig Merrilees, director of California's Fair Trade Campaign, Ms Brown has expressed doubt about the pact, along with the rest of the state's Democratic establishment. The side pacts will be 'silly,' she said, 'It's the same old Bush Nafta with the supplementals used to create a fig-leaf.'
