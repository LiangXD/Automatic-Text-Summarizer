With dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassroots organisations have succeed in fanning anti-Nafta sentiment into widespread public hostility against the pact with Canada and Mexico. A new Wall Street Journal poll, found opposition, at 36 per cent, had reached its highest level yet with only 25 per cent of those polled in favour of Nafta. Pro-Nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting the opposition's success in framing the debate against Nafta as a pact which would cost jobs. But they took heart from Tuesday's presidential show: President Clinton's passionate insistence that the realities of the global marketplace be faced; President Carter's attack on Mr Ross Perot, the populist billionaire, as a demagogue with 'unlimited financial resources,'; President Bush's praise of Mexican President Carlos Salinas; President Ford's warning that the country would be overrun by impoverished immigrants from the South if they are given no work at home. To keep the pro-Nafta case before the public, President Clinton Wednesday took off for New Orleans and top officials in his administration fanned out on speaking tours across the country. In response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental, citizen and labour groups, Vice president Al Gore, Senator Max Baucus and other lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the largest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental side pact, held a briefing to praise Nafta's environmental safeguards. Seemingly unfazed by Nafta's new show of life, the Citizens Trade Campaign, one of the umbrella opposition groups, called a press conference to 'debunk' the Clinton Administration claim Nafta would create 200,000 jobs in the next five years. Without Nafta, the US relationship with Mexico could 'deteriorate,' and 'much of what people are worried about will happen, perhaps more speedily without Nafta than with it.
