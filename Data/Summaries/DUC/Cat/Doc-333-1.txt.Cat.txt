In thinly veiled comments in his resignation letter, Sununu made it clear that he felt betrayed because, in many ways, he was doing exactly what Bush had hired him to do.; The departing chief of staff was also obliquely reminding the president that this was not a matter of principle, but of ratings; his bullying tactics had been fine as long as the opinion polls did not go down.; I assure you that in pit bull mode or pussycat mode (your choice, as always), I am ready to help, Sununu wrote.; His reference was sardonic. Sununu embodied the barbed-wire side of Bush's politics; in many critical ways, he was an accurate reflection of the way Bush believed things should work.; During the 1988 campaign, Bush conceded in interviews that he had to do some of the dirty work in attacking Dukakis; his alternating nice and nasty faces came to be known as George the Gentle and George the Ripper. ; But as president, Bush preferred to farm out to aides the duties of bully and gunslinger.; By making the abrasive former governor of New Hampshire his chief of staff, Bush hoped that he could keep a certain balance of rough and smooth in his governing and in his politics.; In the many times over the past three years when Sununu helped land the president in the political soup, the Washington political cognoscenti speculated that Bush was keeping his chief of staff only out of loyalty to Sununu for helping him win the New Hampshire primary, or because Bush was too nice to fire anyone, or because he was too indecisive.; The truth is more complicated, and Sununu put his finger on it Tuesday. His brisk certainty and willingness to take bold stands complement his risk-averse boss. ; But in many critical ways, Sununu exacerbated Bush's limitations, rather than making up for them, and whenever the spotlight swung away from foreign affairs, it became painfully apparent that this was a White House without a long-range agenda, without a communications strategy and without first-rate thinkers in many top jobs.; As Bush tried to be the ultimate Washington insider, the chief of staff alienated Congress, Cabinet members, House Republicans and the press, who disdained Sununu because they believed he misled them.
