Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) -- The Sunday Review television program said that according to a very reliable source, the end of the popular war, the surrender of weapons, and a general amnesty, would be the main points of a peace agreement without victors or vanquished, between the Shining Path and the Peruvian Government. According to the Sunday Review program, directed by journalist Nicolas Lucar on the Lima America Channel 4 Television Network, the 10-point agreement says its main aspect is to stop the popular war with its four forms of fighting: terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and armed agitation and propaganda. Together with the improvement of relations between both parties, it is also stressed that the agreement would be without conquerors or vanquished, and would ease the way for the return of those Shining Path members living abroad in order to recover the country's social and normal life.
