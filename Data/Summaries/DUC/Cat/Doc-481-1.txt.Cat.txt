President Bush today renewed his threat to veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond $4.25 an hour as Senate Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage floor to $4.55. House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who met with Bush and relayed his comments to reporters, said the president "made it abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility, not one penny, not one deviation" from his position on the minimum wage. But Kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his measure identical to the House bill passed two weeks ago, which has a final wage of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants in the job market a "sub-minimum" for two months. Bush has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new employees a sub-minimum "training wage" for six months. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., told reporters afterward that "the message that was given to the president by the Senate (GOP) leadership was that we're going to stand with him on the minimum wage issue. Meanwhile, a new poll said there was overwhelming public support for an increase in the minimum wage, which has been at $3.35 since 1981. A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage said Bush's repeated veto threats had all but quashed any hopes by Democratic sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president. While the House-passed bill cuts the final target of the hourly minimum wage to $4.55, it moves up the effective dates of the three increases from Jan. Bush has proposed three 30-cent increases in the minimum wage beginning Jan. The president said his support for those increases hinges on a provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for six months regardless of any past experience with another employer. The sub-minimum, under the Bush plan, would be $3.35 an hour after the first increase in the minimum wage. 1. When the subsequent increases in the minimum wage took effect the sub-minimum would rise as well, to 85 percent of the minimum.
