At least four moderate earthquakes rattled parts of the world, but there was nary a tremor Monday along the New Madrid Fault, where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to occur. "This is just a normal day," said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. Along the New Madrid Fault, some schools were canceled and residents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town, just in case climatologist Iben Browning was right. Browning said there was a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake early this week along the fault, which stretches from Marked Tree, Ark., northeast through New Marid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill. "There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said Person, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than 25 years. The center received more than 50 calls about the New Madrid forecast Monday morning and hundreds last week, said Person, who began doing interviews for radio and television stations just after midnight. The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by an earthquake. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a "major" earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a "great" quake, capable of tremendous damage. The big San Francisco Bay area quake last year registered 7.1 on the Richter scale. In 1989, the earthquake center recorded 14,604 earthquakes, with a magnitude 1 or higher, Person said. Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible, Person said. One woman called daily, alerting Person that an earthquake was about to occur, based on the number of birds that crossed her windshield as she drove down the street.
