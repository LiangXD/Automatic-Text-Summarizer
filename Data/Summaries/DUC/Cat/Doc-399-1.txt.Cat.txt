"Today, March 16, 1989, the American journalist Terry Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press in Beirut, entered his fifth year of captivity as a hostage in Lebanon," said a statement that the groups asked broadcasters to air and newspapers to use on their front pages. The "statement of solidarity with Anderson" is from "the leading freedom of expression organizations in the Western world," Anne Nelson, executive director of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, said Monday. "We call on President Bush and Vice President Quayle to use every possible means at their disposal to bring Terry Anderson and the other hostages home," Ms. Nelson said. In a separate letter to its members, the 150,000-member International Federation of Journalists said: "On March 16, another shameful date in the calendar passes _ the fourth anniversary of captivity for American journalist Terry Anderson, who is held hostage in Beirut."
