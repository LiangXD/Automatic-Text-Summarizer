19, the same day Oakland firefighters thought they had contained a brush fire that a day later blossomed into the deadly firestorm.; It's in the mountain communities that straddle Highway 9 in Santa Cruz County, isolated by weak bridges that won't support some firetrucks and connected by a two-lane road that will hinder escape.; It's in Los Altos Hills, where residents in 1984 repealed an ordinance requiring fire-retardant roofs; a year later, a fire destroyed 100 acres and 12 homes, many of which have been rebuilt -- with the same flammable shake roofs.; In fact, the danger of an Oakland-like inferno is in almost all of the hills that ring the South Bay, where homes often are surrounded by dense brush or stately trees, the fuel of rapidly spreading wildfires.; And the risk is increasing, as cramped Bay Area residents push farther into the hills and canyons in search of living space and rural atmosphere. State officials say it's no coincidence that six of California's 10 most damaging wildfires have occurred since 1980.; The tendency is to have bigger fires that are much more expensive to put out, with much more property loss, said Roy Pike, a deputy chief in the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Santa Rosa office.; Privacy's high price; Having pushed into these areas, city dwellers don't understand that the wooded seclusion and natural beauty exact a cost in fire protection, rescue workers complain.; In cities, a firetruck might respond to an alarm within two or three minutes; in the Highway 9 communities, they hope for 10 minutes. By not trimming dense brush, he said, some homeowners are virtually signing a death warrant. ; And increasingly, fire officials worry about wildfires spreading into even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills, where numerous trees create an urban forest. ; We could have a fire going from rooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city, if the weather conditions are right, said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Osby.; The lesson of the Oakland hills, firefighters say, is to contain and extinguish even the smallest fires as quickly as possible. Now, these communities are the year-round home for thousands, often still dependent on volunteer firefighters and an overtaxed network of roads and water lines.; On a good day, trying to maneuver fire apparatus on those roads is tough, said Steve Cavallero, a battalion chief for the Redwood City Fire Department, which covers a portion of Emerald Lake Hills. In the east foothills and southern Santa Clara County, homeowners have to provide only 5,000 gallons for firefighting, barely enough for five minutes at the rate some firetrucks pump.; To Mike Balesteri, chief of the forestry department ranger unit in Santa Clara County, the lesson is simple: It's either bring your own water or find your own water in our game. ; Taps would go dry quickly; Even when rural communities have upgraded their water systems -- as Redwood Estates did -- firefighters say the taps would start to run low if three or four houses were burning at once.; Local officials say they try to limit fire hazards largely by restricting development in the hills. But many of the most dangerous areas were built long before modern planning ordinances and building codes.; And for every community, like Saratoga, that requires fire-retardant roofs, there are others, like Los Altos Hills, unwilling to suffer even that inconvenience.; Seven years later, the Los Altos Hills revolt against fire-retardant roofs still resonates in the mind of Los Altos Fire Chief Dick Landrum, whose department is charged with protecting the area.; Every time my fire marshal starts to talk about amendments to the... building code, they say, 'Don't even bring it up,' Landrum said.; I would hate to say it, but I'd anticipate another Oakland.
