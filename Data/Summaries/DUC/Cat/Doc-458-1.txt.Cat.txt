CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with Beijing. The statement by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office was seen in the colony as an attempt by China to undermine confidence in Hong Kong's economy and to defeat proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, for more democratic elections due in 1995. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese government, in a dispatch released through the Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, said that all contracts, leases and agreements signed and ratified by the Hong Kong government would be invalid after June 30 1997 unless they were first approved by China. In the absence of a British climbdown on democracy, or the defeat of Mr Patten's proposals on the floor of the local legislature, China's escalating attacks could undermine some large-scale business ventures in energy, communications and trade which are planned for Hong Kong in addition to the colony's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 15bn) airport project. The Hong Kong government responded to China's latest attack by declaring that Beijing was in breach of both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future and the 1990 Basic Law - the colony's post-1997 constitution - drafted by Beijing.
