Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a strain of mad cow disease affecting a type of antelope can be transmitted much more easily than was thought. The zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease since it appeared in cows. Sheep are believed to catch the disease by contact with placentas in fields after births, but in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely. If this were so, it would have important implications for the disease in cows. Because of the danger to other animals, the kudu herd has been isolated. The scientists say that the next step must be to examine whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as that in cows. If it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu were simply more susceptible to the disease.
