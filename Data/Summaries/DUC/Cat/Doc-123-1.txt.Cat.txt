That black people, whether free or slave, were not citizens of the U.S.; therefore, they had no standing in court. Well known to most students of race relations is the former attorney general and secretary of the Treasury's pre-civil war dictum that black people being of an inferior order had no right which any white man was bound to respect. Much less known are his equally racist pronouncements denying black people, whether slave or free, specific constitutional protections enjoyed by whites. In Dred Scott Chief Justice Taney, writing for the court's majority, stated that if blacks were entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens,... {i}t would give persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one state of the union, the right... to keep and carry arms wherever they went. Although much of Justice Taney's overtly racist legal reasoning was repudiated by events that followed -- such as the Civil War and Reconstruction -- the subliminal effects were felt throughout that era. Gun control was never an issue in America until after the Civil War when black slaves were freed. It was this change in the status of the black man, from slave to freeman, that caused racist elements in the country (North and South) to agitate for restrictions on guns -- ignoring long established customs and understanding of the Second Amendment. The specter of a black man with rights of a freeman, bearing arms, was too much for the early heirs of Roger Taney to bear. The 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, along with the various Reconstruction civil rights acts, prevented gun prohibitionists from making laws that were explicitly racist and that would overtly deny black people the right to bear arms. And what of the origins of the National Rifle Association, which is wrongly viewed as a racist organization by the black supporters of gun prohibition?
