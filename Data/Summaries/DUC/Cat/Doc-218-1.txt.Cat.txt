This week's flare-up of Western wildfires can't hold a candle to the damage wrought by last year's record-breaking fire season, but officials say a dry August could change everything. Fire has charred more than 1.3 million acres of forest and range land since January in the contiguous United States, compared to 2.1 million acres by this time last year, fire officials said Monday. Nearly 10,000 firefighters in five Western states are battling hundreds of blazes, most of them sparked last week by lightning. Last year's combination of heat and drought across a wide swath of the West produced a hellish summer of smoke and flame. By year's end, 6 million acres had burned in the West and Alaska, making 1988 the worst fire season in 30 years, and, in terms of firefighting resources committed, the most expensive in U.S. history, Sacher said.
