For that reason and others, the Constitutional Convention unanimously rejected term limits and the First Congress soundly defeated two subsequent term-limit proposals. Over the years, term limits would have unseated Daniel Webster and Henry Clay 10 years before they forged the 1850 Compromise that held the Union together. Term limits would have cost us Everett Dirksen, who rallied Republicans around early civil-rights bills and Florida's own Claude Pepper, who long defended Social Security and Medicare against revenue raids.
