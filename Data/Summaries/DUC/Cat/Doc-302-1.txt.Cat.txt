News of Smith's death was followed by an outpouring of sympathy from Mississippi to Washington, even as Smith's colleagues were still mourning Leland's death.

Smith, a former sheriff and police chief, was already developing a reputation on the House Judiciary Committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs. The plane belonged to the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies Inc. in Gulfport. The institute immediately issued a statement saying that Smith had requested use of the plane to accommodate his busy schedule. Jody Canady, a spokeswoman, said Smith was to reimburse the institute. The statement said the plane, manufactured in 1973, and purchased by the institute last year, had a current inspection. Smith was elected last November to represent Mississippi's 5th congressional district. Gaston, who worked for Smith nine years both in the sheriff's department and earlier when Smith was Gulfport police chief, called Smith a pillar of strength.
