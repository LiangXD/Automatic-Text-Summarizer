<P> Public officials throughout California have condemned a U.S. Senate vote Thursday to exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 census, saying the action will shortchange California in Congress and possibly deprive the state of millions of dollars of federal aid for medical emergency services and other programs for poor people. </P> <P> I think it's an outrageous piece of legislation and probably unconstitutional, Assemblyman Peter Chacon said Friday. Chacon, a San Diego Democrat, is the chairman of the Assembly's Elections, Reapportionment and Constitutional Amendments Committee. </P> <P> At the same time, the Senate's action has created great confusion and stirred hopes, especially among urban Democrats, that it will be overturned by the House of Representatives. </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Impact </P> <P> If it becomes law, the Senate's action could have a major impact on California and other states where the influx of illegal aliens significantly boosts the population and, thus, can affect the size of congressional delegations and the amount of federal aid that is doled out. Milton Marks, a San Francisco Democrat who chairs the Senate's Elections and Reapportionment Committee. </P> <P> </P> <P> Loss of Funds Feared </P> <P> Jesse R. Huff, the state's financial director, said the state could lose as much as $300 million in federal aid that is allocated on the basis of population as determined by census counts. </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials said the measure could cut off federal funds for emergency medical services for illegal aliens. Hahn's office said the city could lose at least $20 million in federal aid over the next 10 years -- money that goes for child care, housing rehabilitation, drug counseling and services for homeless people. </P> <P> </P> <P> Immigration Law Overhaul </P> <P> The measure passed by the Senate was part of a larger overhaul of the nation's immigration laws that, if it becomes law, would place an annual cap of 630,000 immigrants for each of the next three years and make room for more residents of Western Europe. </P> <P> The Senate bill is expected to face tough opposition in the House, where states such as California, New York and Illinois with large alien populations have many votes. Moreover, a federal court in Pittsburgh ruled earlier this year that excluding illegal aliens from the census would be unconstitutional. </P> <P> But even if the Senate's action were to become law, it is not clear how much impact it would have on federal aid. </P> <P> I think the effect is going to be minimal, said Michael Myers, counsel to the House subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs. Myers said that most of the assistance that states and cities now receive comes in the form of block grants that do not qualify as direct financial aid and, therefore, would not be affected. </P> <P> </P> <P> Puzzled by Action </P> <P> Still, many local officials remain puzzled by the Senate's action. </P> <P> Tajima said he was not sure whether programs such as foster care for abused and neglected children or Supplemental Security Income for aged, blind or disabled people would be vulnerable.
