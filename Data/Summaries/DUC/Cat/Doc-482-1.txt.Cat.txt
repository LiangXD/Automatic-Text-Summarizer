A MINIMUM wage is a convenient and effortless way for a left-of-centre government to appear to be doing something about the problems of poverty, public sector pay and the growth of unskilled employment. But Labour's proposed minimum wage would only be positively harmful if, as the Tories claim, it will reduce employment. There are many estimates of the potential employment cost of Labour's minimum wage. No-one knows whether, or how, introducing a statutory minimum wage would affect unskilled wages and employment. Most US studies of the effects of the minimum wage over the past few decades have found a moderately negative impact on employment, mainly among young people. A recent study of the effect of extending the mainland minimum wage to Puerto Rico in 1974 found a more dramatic employment effect. Yet a number of recent empirical studies of the effect of last year's rise in the US minimum wage fail to support this traditional view. Over half of the restaurants had to raise the lowest wage they paid by the full 45 cent increase in the minimum wage. On average, the restaurants that had to increase their wages by more tended also to have a larger increase in employment, as the right-hand chart shows. There are many outliers; but the upward sloping 'best-fit' line between the dots indicates a positive, and statistically significant, relationship between higher mandated wage growth and higher employment. A 10 per cent wage increase is predicted to raise relative full-time employment by 25 per cent.
