A five-man U.N. team arrived in the Iranian capital of Tehran today to investigate the downing an Iranian jetliner by a U.S. warship. The International Civil Aviation Organization team planned to start its probe at Tehran international airport, where part of Iran's air traffic control network is based, said Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. The group from the Montreal-based U.N. agency planned to travel to Bandar Abbas airport in southern Iran, from which the Iran Air Airbus took off on a brief scheduled flight to Dubai on July 5. The team is in Iran at the request of the Iranian government to help resolve discrepancies in accounts given by the two sides. The U.S. team left the gulf Thursday after spending 3{ weeks in the region, Navy officials said. U.S. delegate Edmund Stohr said the United States will offer the U.N. investigating team whatever help it can. He said the team had not asked to board the Vincennes, and he didn't know if such a visit would be possible considering the military situation in the gulf.
