That means Clark County controls the Nevada Legislature: 36 of 63 state lawmakers are from the Las Vegas area, and the contingent is sure to grow with next year's reapportionment. "If there's something in state water law we can hang our hat on to deter this plan, the power is in Las Vegas and Clark County and they'll just go ahead and change the law," said Steve Bradhurst, a consultant to the rural counties. Last year, Clark County casinos accounted for 70 percent of the state's $4.6 billion in gaming revenues. "There is one large metropolitan area from which the bulk of all revenues in this state come, and that's Clark County," said Pat Mulroy, manager of the Las Vegas Valley Water District.
