Don Jackson, said he set up the self-styled "sting" in Long Beach to expose alleged police racism in the Los Angeles area. The police chief in Long Beach declined to comment pending an investigation. "I... do not support racism or police brutality, nor do the vast majority of the citizens of Long Beach, and we're a caring, thinking community and it disturbed us very much to see the tape," he said. The NBC-TV videotape shows a white officer attempting to search Jackson. "I submit that if Mr. Jackson had stayed in the vehicle, as did the driver, this incident would not have occurred," Hawthorne Police Chief Kenneth R. Stonebraker said at a news conference Monday. The 30-year-old Jackson, who has been on a stress-related disability leave from his Hawthorne job for 22 months, contends the incident is typical of a pattern of racism by white officers in the Los Angeles area. He has a disability lawsuit pending, has filed racism complaints against the department and conducted a similar personal sting operation against Los Angeles police. Jackson got out after the car stopped and police approached. During an argument, Long Beach Officer Mark Dickey ordered Jackson to face a building and put his hands behind his head. Police booked Jackson for investigation of interfering with police and challenging a police officer. "The officer simply used violence," Jackson said Monday. Jackson received support at a Monday night ceremony in Los Angeles commemorating King's birthday. "I'm deeply concerned since it strikes me as a period when police violence and excessive force is rampant," said Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Los Angeles chapter. Jackson said he chose Long Beach police because of complaints to the Police Misconduct Lawyer's Referral Service of Los Angeles. David Lynn of the referral service said 50 misconduct complaints were filed with his group against the Long Beach police.
