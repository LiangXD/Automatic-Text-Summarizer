Testifying in Mr. Keating's court challenge to the takeover, Mr. Seibold said lots of documents -- loan and credit files -- were missing when an FDIC team swept through Lincoln's offices in Phoenix, Ariz., April 14, 1989. But during a break in the trial, Mr. Keating said the suggestion that there was any bartering to get documents back was ridiculous. He explained that Lincoln's files were spread among two buildings used by Lincoln and by American Continental Corp., the parent company. Mr. Keating also said that Lincoln was required to keep all original loan files at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. Henry Gonzalez, who made Mr. Keating something of a celebrity with his hearings on Lincoln last year, called for the Justice Department to freeze the assets of Mr. Keating and other highflyers who have defrauded savings and loans.
