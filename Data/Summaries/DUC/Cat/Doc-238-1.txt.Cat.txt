THE FIGHT over the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday shifted outside Washington to the Congressional districts of members, sampling public opinion at home during this Veterans' Day holiday weekend. Arthur Andersen &amp; Company yesterday released a survey, by its tax and business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives of medium-sized companies in Canada, Mexico and the US strongly support Nafta. Meanwhile in Mexico the country's Congress launched a fierce attack on Mr Perot and other critics of its political system yesterday, in a furious response to Mr Perot's comments in the debate. The Mexican Congress issued a statement, supported by most political parties, which said: 'We cannot ignore however, that certain judgments expressed, apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country, attack and offend Mexicans. Ms Lori Wallach, an anti-Nafta leader, said Nafta would be won or lost in the congressmen's home districts. The anti-Nafta Citizens' Trade Campaign is bringing 'Nafta Claus' to the Capitol to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell Nafta to a reluctant Congress.
