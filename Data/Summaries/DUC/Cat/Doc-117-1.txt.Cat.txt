The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with viral pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection, her doctors said Friday. The Oscar-winning star of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "Butterfield 8" entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with a sinus infection, but her condition deteriorated and she was moved to St. John's for treatment of viral pneumonia.
