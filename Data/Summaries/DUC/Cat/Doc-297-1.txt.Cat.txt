A single-engine airplane crashed Tuesday into a ditch beside a dirt road on the outskirts of Albuquerque, killing all five people aboard, authorities said. The airplane was attempting to land at nearby Coronado Airport, Porter said. Walter Ramazzini Jr., 17, of Albuquerque, said he was sitting about 100 yards from the airplane when it crashed. "He was going east, making a left turn from the airport," Ramazzini said. To correct for that, he banked right and he kept going and passed level flight as if to turn right," Ramazzini said. "To correct again for that, he went again to the left... and went nose-first into the ground," said Ramazzini, a student pilot. The airplane "wasn't very high _ maybe 100 feet," Ramazzini said. "We went up there and there was nobody alive," Ramazzini said. Firefighters arrived later and sprayed the crumpled airplane with water before rescue crews removed the bodies from the craft.
