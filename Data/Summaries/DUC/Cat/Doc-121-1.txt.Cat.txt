A 1987 state constitutional amendment broadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felons may own guns, a judge ruled. "If Maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict or qualify the right to keep and bear arms, they could have enacted a constitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions," Perkins wrote. "Maine's right to keep and bear arms amendment is the most broad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar state amendments," he wrote. The Maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep and bear arms "for the common defense."
