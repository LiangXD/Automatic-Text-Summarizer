30, and scientists at the National Hurricane Center, tucked away on the sixth floor of a nondescript office building in this Miami suburb, are perking up after another winter lull.; From now until the end of the season, the six hurricane specialists will monitor weather computers 24 hours a day. When a disturbance becomes threatening, a specially equipped plane is sent into the storm's heart to measure barometric pressure, wind speed and temperature.; One of the specialists, Lixion Avila, has begun counting tropical waves that form off the coast of Africa every few days during hurricane season. About 20 of them intensify into stronger disturbances, ranging from tropical depressions, with wind speeds to 38 mph; to tropical storms, with winds from 39 to 73 mph; to hurricanes, with winds exceeding 74 mph.; Last year, 16 tropical depressions developed in the Atlantic. More than 800 workers, brought down to build the Overseas Highway through the Florida Keys, were killed when 200 mph winds knocked their evacuation train off the tracks.; NO MATTER what long-range forecasters say, scientists at the Hurricane Center know that the laws of probability are closing in on Miami. Miami has grown immensely since the last major storm and is greatly overdue, they said.; Historically, south Florida has had more hurricanes than any other site, said Jerry Jarrell, a hurricane specialist eyeing Miami's 27-year hiatus nervously. We would expect a major hurricane to hit within 75 miles of Miami every eight years. ; At the center, scientists built a computer model to calculate what would happen if the 1926 hurricane were to hit Miami today. The scientists took data from Hugo and applied it to the path taken by the 1926 hurricane into Miami.; It would be a totally different story here, said Max Mayfield, who collected photos from the 1926 storm to illustrate the model. This, and the number of years since the last major storm hit, has spawned a certain complacency among residents that the specialists find disturbing.; Mayfield went to Miami Beach recently to discuss his model with officials there, and what he heard worried him.; The fire department did a survey, and 90 percent of the people they talked to said they wouldn't evacuate for a hurricane, Mayfield said.
