One crew member gushed about a future when humans will become custodians of our world. ; Today we gather at a new instrument... to explore the mysteries of our very own home planet, Bass said, as the crew members, wearing futuristic black uniforms, fought to contain their emotions.; Crew member Abigail Alling, 31, her voice quavering, evoked the sometimes mystical bent of Biosphere 2's organizers: By necessity, we biospherians walk in as custodians of our world and bring past and future together. ; At 8:18 a.m., the four men and four women of the crew exchanged quick hugs and kisses with relatives and project officials, stepped through an air-lock door, waved through the round window, and disappeared inside the 3.15-acre geodesic-framed compound.; I have had a vision that man could change from being a desert-maker into a builder of oases, crew member Mark Nelson said before stepping through the air lock.; Biosphere 2 consists of several climatic zones -- rain forest, savanna, ocean and marsh -- packed with 3,800 plant and animal species. Wednesday they celebrated a final day of freedom with diversity by attending an ecological seminar, a laser show, a cocktail party and a press conference.; The 45-minute closing ceremony after dawn today included prayers from a Tibetan monk and a sun dance by Dan Old Elk, a Sioux from Montana who presented each crew member with a braided sprig of sweet grass from Canada.; Alling, a native of New York, said before the experiment began that she expects life inside Biosphere 2 to be much like a ship setting sail for the open sea. ; You're out there, and whatever you have on board and whoever is with you on board is who you've got, and you've got to make it through whatever comes up, she said.; The four-man, four-woman group has two people from England, one from Belgium and five from the United States.; Each crew member is likely to spend about four hours daily on farming and other chores to maintain the complicated machinery driving the Biosphere. Another four hours a day will go to scientific work.; Sex has not been ruled out among the crew members, but none of the four women plans a pregnancy.; Mark van Thillo, 30, of Belgium said he would miss his country's chocolates, while Taber McCallum, 27, of Albuquerque, N.M., said he'll regret not sailing on the open ocean and the open sky. ; The crew is hoping to stay inside for two years, barring serious illness or other calamity.; But Margret Augustine, president and chief executive officer of the project, said problems could crop up after a month or so that would require the crew to leave temporarily before returning for a solid two years.
