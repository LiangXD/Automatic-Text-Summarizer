Fire broke out aboard a Soviet passenger liner carrying French tourists on a cruise of the Mediterranean, but the blaze was put out by the crew and no passengers were injured, Tass reported Monday. The Shota Rustaveli was 25 miles off the island of Malta when a blaze broke out in the auxiliary engine room, the official news agency said. The tourists were expected to continue their voyage on another Soviet ship, and the crew of the Shota Rustaveli was to make repairs and bring the ship home, Tass said.
