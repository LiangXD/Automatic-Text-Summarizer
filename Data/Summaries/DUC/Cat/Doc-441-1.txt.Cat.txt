'Only God can help us through this crisis,' said the Afrikaner preacher called to provide spiritual guidance to South Africa's farmers, who have been hit by one of the worst droughts in living memory. Indeed, in the eastern Transvaal town of Bethal, where Dominee Nel was delivering his sermon at a farmers' meeting earlier this week, elderly residents say this drought is the worst since 1933. Agricultural economists point out that drought years are more the norm in South Africa than the exception. But Mr Koos du Toit, chief economist of the South African Agricultural Union, says it is the worst drought he has ever seen, and the most widespread. The Maize Board, the state marketing board, expects a crop of 4m tonnes, though Mr du Toit believes it could be closer to 3m or 3.5m, which would make it the worst harvest in 50 years. None the less, Pretoria is understood to be contemplating substantial drought aid for farmers: several hundred million rands, or perhaps as much as R1bn (Pounds 200m) over two to three years. Without such aid, the Maize Board estimates that some 2,000 to 3,000 of the 17,000 maize farmers could be forced off the land this year, victims of high interest rates, high input costs, and excessive debt, with drought just administering the coup de grace.
