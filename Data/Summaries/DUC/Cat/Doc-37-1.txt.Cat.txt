President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a Cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as "the slar eclipse of the century" on July 11. Posters have been placed in Mexico City subways promoting the event, and resorts along the eclipse's path are scrambling to accommodate the expected rush of tourists. "It's the most important eclipse in history," says Miguel Gil Guzman, secretary-general of the Mexican Astronomical Society. The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes, the maximum length for a total solar eclipse. But the special government commission, Eclipse 1991, is banking on the clouds to roll in the country's financial favor. Baja California Sur alone plans to spend $26.5 million for public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in millions more from tourism. It will be the last chance to see a total solar eclipse this century. Cuernavaca, 35 miles south of Mexico City, is hosting a geophysicists' congress during the week of the eclipse. The National University is developing six half-hour documentaries on eclipses and 10 TV spots on the dangers of looking at the sun, astronomy professor Jesus Galindo says. Since September, the university newspaper has been publishing installments of a book called "Eclipse" that will be translated into Indian languages. The government plans to supervise the production of special lenses for viewing an eclipse.
