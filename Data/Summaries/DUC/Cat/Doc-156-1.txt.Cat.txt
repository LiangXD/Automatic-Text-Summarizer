Canadians were shamed, angry and saddened Tuesday that national hero Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal for using drugs to enhance his performance. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who had thanked the Jamaican-born runner for the "thrill of a lifetime" after his record-breaking 9.79-second performance Saturday, called the drug scandal "a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians." Sports Minister Jean Charest, who called the incident "a national embarrassment," said Johnson will be banned from Canada's national team for life. Charest said his government accepted the validity of the tests and the suspension would be effective pending an appeal from Johnson. Mike Sokowski, a teammate at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, said: "Ben's a pretty simple guy. Canadian speedskater Gaetan Boucher judged the sprinter harshly, saying he has "no respect" for an athlete who takes drugs. Charest acknowledged that it was suggested to him several months ago that Johnson might be using steroids. "From time to time people would come to me in a private way _ and this happened one or two times... that maybe Ben Johnson is using steroids or other drugs," he said. Charest said he didn't press Johnson to have a drug test because he thought the sprinter was aware that medal winners at the Olympics would be tested for drugs immediately following competition. "Everybody knew in advance that Mr. Johnson, if he wins a medal, was going to be tested," said Charest.
