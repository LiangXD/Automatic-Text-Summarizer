Harlow and his team predicted the 1989 eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, but few lives were threatened in the remote area.; Three weeks ago, Harlow joined a team of five U.S. Geological Survey scientists who worked with 10 Filipino scientists to try to forecast the eruption of the volcano, which had been dormant for about 600 years. One crew gathered evidence of Pinatubo's earlier eruptions as clues to its potential power.; Harlow's team set up a ring of a half-dozen seismographs around the volcano to measure the deep tremors caused by molten lava slowly pushing to the surface and the shallower tremors that follow when the eruption is imminent.; Pinatubo followed an almost textbook pattern over the past six weeks. My husband is not unaccustomed to danger. ; Lord said Harlow's love affair with volcanoes began when he was an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College and his professor took the entire class to observe an eruption in Guatemala.; He's somebody who's fascinated by that kind of energy, said Lord, a psychotherapist who has accompanied Harlow to several volcanoes.
