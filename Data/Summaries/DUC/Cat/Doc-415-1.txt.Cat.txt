Safety standards may not be stringent enough in the cruise industry, the chairman of a federal agency investigating the March engine-room fire aboard the Scandinavian Star said Wednesday. "There may not be sufficient safety standards," he said, adding that his agency has probed fires aboard four cruise ships in the past five years. The March 15 engine-room fire aboard the Star, carrying 439 mostly American passengers, was discovered by a crew member as the ship returned from Cozumel, Mexico to its Tampa home port. "Although there were no injuries or deaths, the failure of the vessel's safety systems highlights the potential for a catastrophic loss of life in this accident and future vessel fires," Burnett said. Its engine room was badly damaged by the fire, and there was smoke and water damage throughout the 17-year-old French-made ship, which has since been repaired. An NTSB report said the fire ignited when pressurized fuel leaked from a line and sprayed against a hot engine exhaust manifold. Peter Schaab said he had to send an officer to the engine room to confirm there was a fire. "There was no further spreading," said Schaab, who was praised by Burnett for his 268-member crew acting quickly to move passengers from ship discos, bars, shows and dining rooms. The official analysis of the fire and any recommendations that come out of the hearings will be adopted by the full NTSB board in Washington later this summer.
