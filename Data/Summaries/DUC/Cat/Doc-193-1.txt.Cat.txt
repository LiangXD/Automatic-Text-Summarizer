Suspected communist rebels today killed the police chief of the Philippines' major financial center in an escalation of street violence sweeping the capital area, police said. Col. Herminio Taylo, 54, police chief of Makati, had just finished jogging and was buying fruit in a public market when two assassins opened fire with.45-caliber pistols, police said. The military says communist rebels have killed up to 65 soldiers and police in the capital region since January. The New People's Army also claimed responsibility for the April 21 assassination of U.S. Army Col. James "Nick" Rowe, who was slain on his way to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group headquarters in suburban Quezon City. "It is really very unfortunate and I do sympathize with the family of Col. Taylo," said Mrs. Aquino, whose husband Benigno was slain in a political assassination in 1983. "And I hope that this, perhaps, could be a reminder to all our people in the military and police that they should take necessary precautions to ward off these assasination attempts." National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto said the killing of Taylo showed that every soldier and policeman was a potential target of assassination.
