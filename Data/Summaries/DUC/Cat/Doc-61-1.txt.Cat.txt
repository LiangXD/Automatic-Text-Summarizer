The Senate today confirmed conservative civil rights official Clarence Thomas as a federal appeals judge, brushing aside complaints about his record from some liberal and senior citizens groups. The Senate had planned to take a roll call on the nomination but changed course at the last minute and confirmed Thomas on a voice vote. Thomas, 41, will be a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. Thomas, a critic of quotas and affirmative action to fight hiring discrimination, has been highly praised by conservatives. It became clear Monday night that Thomas' critics had failed to muster enough support to defeat his nomination. "I am prepared to concede that Mr. Thomas is going to be confirmed," said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, who complained that the statute of limitations on 15,000 age-discrimination cases before the EEOC ran out without any action being taken while Thomas was in charge. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., dismissed complaints that Thomas had failed to cooperate with the Aging Committee several years ago when former Sen. "They wasted a lot of time trying to nail Clarence Thomas," he said. Thomas was born in poverty in rural Georgia, worked his way through college and is a graduate of Yale Law School.
