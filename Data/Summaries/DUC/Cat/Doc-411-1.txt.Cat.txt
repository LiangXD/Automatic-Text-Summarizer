The cruise ship Song of America was forced to return to port after an engine seized up and started a small fire, but no one was hurt, the ship's owner said today. On Tuesday, a few hours out of Cozumel, Mexico, one of its four engines seized up, touching off a fire in the engine room, said Royal Caribbean Cruise Line spokesman Rich Steck.
