Will C. Rogers III was awarded the Legion of Merit, a top military honor, on Saturday as he stepped down from command of the Vincennes. Rogers was given the award for his performance as commanding officer of the guided-missile cruiser, which became the focus of international controversy last July when it mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people aboard. Speaking from the deck of the Vincennes, Rogers paid special tribute to his wife, Sharon, who narrowly escaped death in March when a suspected terrorist bomb destroyed her van as she was driving to her teaching job at an exclusive private school in La Jolla. She was fired by administrators of the exclusive La Jolla Country Day School, who feared that her presence posed a security threat to the children. Among the guests were a number of children from the fourth-grade class Sharon Rogers taught at the La Jolla Country Day School. Rogers was presented with a letter saying that while on duty in the Persian Gulf, his tactical skills and calm direction enabled his crew to successfully engage seven heavily armed high-speed Iranian surface craft attacking the Vincennes in confined and confused waters.
