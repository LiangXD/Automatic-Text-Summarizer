President Reagan will nominate national security adviser Colin Powell for promotion to four-star rank and the post of commander-in-chief of the Army's Forces Command, the White House and Pentagon announced today. In the new post, Powell would be in charge of all the Army troops in the continental United States. "President Reagan has the highest respect and affection for General Powell and wishes him all success in his Army career," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in announcing the nomination. "General Powell has been a friend and colleague whose advice and counsel have been valued by all members of the White House staff. The spokesman said that Powell is expected to assume command in April, 1989, when the current commander, Gen. Joseph T. Palastra Jr., retires. After leaving the White House Powell plans to visit a number of army units before assuming his command, Fitzwater said. The Pentagon later released a short statement announcing President Reagan's intent to nominate Powell for the job. Carlucci immediately recruited Powell as his deputy, drawing him away from a major command in Europe, and Powell moved up to the top White House spot after Carlucci's move to the Pentagon. While later serving as an assistant to Carlucci in the National Security Council, Powell received his first star.
