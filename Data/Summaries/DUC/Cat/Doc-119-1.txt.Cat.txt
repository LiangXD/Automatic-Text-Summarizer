Second Amendment states (1791): A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. The Second Amendment was, as was the rest of the first 10 amendments (the Bill of Rights), insisted upon by some of the states for their own protection from the federal government. The court in Cruikshank said that the Second Amendment did not create a federally protected right of individuals but was an express limitation on the powers of the national (federal) government. The status of the Second Amendment as a constitutional issue is and has been for nearly 200 years: 1) A restriction on the power of the federal government to limit or deny the states the right to have state militia.
