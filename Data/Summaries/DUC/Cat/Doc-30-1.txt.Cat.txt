A source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the panel report did not focus on Gates -- who said he would resign if the commission agreed with his critics that he created a climate within the department that condoned racism and brutality.; The report deals with management issues, not directly with the chief of police, the source said.; Commission members and others who had seen the report declined comment Monday. Gates also wouldn't comment.; Mayor Tom Bradley, who has asked Gates to step down, said through a spokesman he believed the report focused on police management, excessive force and civilian control.; Sources familiar with testimony and evidence presented to the panel told the Los Angeles Times that a number of racially derogatory messages sent on police car computer terminals have been cataloged.; One message, for which no context was provided, read: It's monkey slapping time. ; The commission examined 90,000 pages of computer messages and found examples of racially and sexually offensive remarks scattered throughout. In another, an officer testified behind closed doors that he was present when a caravan of patrol cars raced through a housing project with Ride of the Valkyries blaring from loudspeakers -- a scene reminiscent of the movie Apocalypse Now. ; The officers testified before the commission after being assured that their identities would be kept confidential.; The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups called for Gates to resign after the March 3 incident in which white police officers repeatedly struck King with batons, kicked him and shocked him with a stun gun after pulling him over for speeding.
