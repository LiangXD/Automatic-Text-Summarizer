America's senior military officer Tuesday endorsed the East Bloc's move toward a more defensive military posture and reassured his Warsaw Pact counterparts that the United States and its NATO allies will not launch an offensive military operation against Eastern Europe. At a meeting in Vienna, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cited initial evidence that the Warsaw Pact is restructuring its forces in line with new defensive military doctrines in the wake of the Cold War. Despite the encouraging signs, the West's key concern remains the specter of confronting greatly superior forces armed, trained and suited for offensive ground operations, Powell said in prepared remarks at a Vienna session of defense chiefs representing 35 nations from both the East and the West. Powell's remarks appeared to be directed primarily at the chiefs of Eastern Europe's military organizations, whose future roles in the Warsaw Pact are uncertain as a result of the the major domestic upheavals that have swept their nations. Powell also met Tuesday for the first time with the Soviet chief of staff, Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, an encounter that officials said would allow Powell to raise further questions about the Soviets' efforts to restructure their military forces. Saying the seminar's task is to help shape a new order in Europe, Powell defended U.S. military initiatives that have introduced to Europe new, long-range weapons designed to attack Soviet forces sent in to reinforce the first wave of a Warsaw Pact attack on Western Europe.
