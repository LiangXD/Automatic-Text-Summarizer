In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won. One out of four House districts this year likely will have an incumbent running with no major-party opposition -- up from one out of five in 1988. Democratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor had spirited competition in 1984 when he won with 57%; this year he has no opponent at all. Senators have become just as brazen as their House brethren in shutting out competition. Critics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not -- it's wrong to blame Congress for the now nearly 100% re-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an incumbent as for. Michael Kinsley writes in the New Republic that if incumbents always win, it's because voters can't be bothered. The polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way they can control Congress effectively is by limiting terms. As late as 1860, the average length of House service was four years. The number of freshmen in a new House never dipped below 30% until 1901. In the current House it is 8%. The opinion polls for term limitation show that the voters don't like the change.
