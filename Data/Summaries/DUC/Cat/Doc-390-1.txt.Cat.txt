U.S. military experts left the Persian Gulf on Thursday after a 3{-week investigation of the destruction of an Iranian airliner by an American warship, Navy officials said. Pentagon officials said officers of the Vincennes mistook the Airbus A300 for an Iranian F-14 jet fighter on an attack course. The U.S. Navy officials said the report would "work its way up the chain of command" to Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. Investigators compiled data from computer tapes on the Vincennes and two other U.S. warships that were in the area, the frigate USS Elmer Montgomery and missile frigate John H. Sides. In Ottawa, Iranian diplomat Gholamreza Behtashi said a five-member team from the International Civil Aviation Organization is expected to arrive Friday in Tehran, Iran's capital, to pursue its own investigation into the disaster. Behtashi, third secretary at the Iranian Embassy, said the team is made up of technical personnel from the Montreal-based United Nations agency. He said the team had not asked to board the Vincennes, and he didn't know if such a visit would be possible considering the military situation in the gulf.
