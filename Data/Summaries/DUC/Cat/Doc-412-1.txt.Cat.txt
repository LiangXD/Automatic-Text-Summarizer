Someone set a fire early today in a storage room on the luxury liner Regent Star, five days after the ship ran aground in Delaware Bay because of another fire that cut off power, authorities said. "The fire on the Regent Star was started in a maintenance storage room," said Lt. The 20,000-ton liner was on its way from Jamaica to Philadelphia on Sunday when a small fire prompted a power loss, allowing the ship to drift onto a sandbar. The ship had been due to start on a two-day cruise later today, but that was canceled after the second fire broke out, authorities said. An hour after this morning's fire was controlled, about 300 crew members sat or stood in small groups alongside the Port of History Museum where the ship was tied up.
