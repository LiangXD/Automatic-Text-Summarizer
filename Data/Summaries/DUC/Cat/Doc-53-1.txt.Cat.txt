In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years. The president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families. If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is. Many of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform. This suggests that the Democrats aren't as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the American public are. The Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy. The president should take up his case for reform directly with the American people. With the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press Congress to move off the deadening status quo. With the ball in its court, Congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors, or it can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor.
