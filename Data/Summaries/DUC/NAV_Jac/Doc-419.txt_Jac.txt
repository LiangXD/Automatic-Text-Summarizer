Las Vegas is one of only 15 U.S. cities that can provide the hotel rooms and exhibit space for a Southern Baptist convention, said Alvin C. Shackleford, a convention spokesman.Las Vegas, which has welcomed conventions of strippers and swingers in recent years, is ready for the Southern Baptists.In addition to bringing in up to $15 million in revenue, the Southern Baptist convention should help the city's image, Powers said."The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing," said Jay Strack, president of the Conference of Southern Baptist Evangelists."Las Vegas is probably no more notorious in its pagan qualities than any other city," Hastey said.
