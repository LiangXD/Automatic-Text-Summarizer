Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today.By contrast, blacks are genetically more resistant than whites to malaria, which is common in Africa.The research found that when living conditions are identical, black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria.About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the United States, resulting in 1,700 deaths.This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.In the population at large, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as whites."We found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks," said Dr. William W. Stead.
