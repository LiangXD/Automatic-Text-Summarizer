A lie detector that measures brain waves would be more accurate than polygraphs, which measure bodily functions, says its developer.However, a brain-wave lie detector would probably cost 10 times as much as the $500 to $600 for a polygraph, and the operator would need a great deal more training, Weinstein said.Rosenfeld has worked on the detector for almost four years and says it could be widely used within three more.
