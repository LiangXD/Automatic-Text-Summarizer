Mr. Ferris believes this would "put a vitality in the system" while not resulting, unlike overall term limits, in "a bunch of neophytes who'd be more dependent on staff and lobbyists."A powerful antidote would be to limit committee service, which would have few of the political and constitutional drawbacks of term limits.Term limits would accomplish few of their proponents' goals -- more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists.If lawmakers had to change areas of expertise every three or four terms, "they wouldn't have the luxury of being intellectually lazy."Average citizens, the pollsters found, believe they "simply are not being heard in Washington," and more and more are losing confidence in the electoral system as a means of influencing government.Why shouldn't the Commerce committees and the tax-writing and appropriations panels be subjected to the same limits?Argues Mr. Ferris: "Voters never should be prevented from electing a person who they think is the best representative of that community.""Term limits really hit at democracy," says Prof. Fenno.
