McDonnell Douglas Corp., which builds the DC-10, said the plane was delivered to United in 1974.Preparing for Crash Landing "Then they said we were preparing for a crash landing.Eyewitnesses said pieces of the 15-year-old airplane -- one of the oldest airliners in United's fleet -- were falling off as far as 75 miles from the site of the crash.Nine persons were hurled to their deaths last Feb.There were reports from passengers and observers that the plane's right-wing engine also failed before the crash.Their clothes were clean, not mussed, their hair was in place and they had no scratches he could see, he said.Page 17 RESCUE TEAMS READY -- The Sioux City, Iowa, fire-and-rescue operations had practiced for a major emergency.I think it landed upside down," said passenger Melanie Cincala of Toledo, Ohio, who said the plane burst into flames after she got off."In one group of six seats, a woman sitting in the middle was barely injured, her husband beside her was dead and two behind her were dead," Bendixen said.From looking at one or two of them you wouldn't know they were in the accident," Graham said.None of the airliner's 108 passengers were injured.He said the living were scattered among the dead.Survival Rate Remarkable C. O. Miller, former chief investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, said the crash's survival rate was remarkable and was probably the result of the pilot's ability to maneuver the plane close to the ground before losing complete control."We were sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke," said Cliff Marshall of Columbus, Ohio, who was returning home from Denver.St. Luke's Regional Medical Center said 80 to 90 crash victims had been admitted and of those 70 were expected to leave the hospital Wednesday night."We thought it was going to make it," said Glen Olson, city editor of the Sioux City Journal.They said it would be about 30 seconds, but it was about five minutes," another passenger said.Tail Engine Explodes The plane's tail engine exploded before the crash but it was not immediately clear how the explosion contributed to what a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman called "complete hydraulic failure," an occurrence regarded as extremely rare in the wide-bodied DC-10, which has three independent hydraulic systems that operate all the plane's control surfaces on its wings and tail, and landing gear and brakes."It's about the size of a car," she said.A crippled United Airlines DC-10 crashed a half-mile short of a runway while trying to make an emergency landing Wednesday afternoon, bursting into a cartwheeling fireball that broke into what one eyewitness described as "15,000 pieces" and killing at least 123 of the 293 passengers and crew members on board.On Tuesday, a United DC-10 with 249 people aboard slid 300 yards on the runway after landing at rain-soaked O'Hare International Airport in Chicago but there were no injuries.On July 10, a United Boeing 747 was forced to make an emergency landing at Miami International Airport after the plane was damaged in heavy turbulence over the Florida-Georgia border.A DC-10 was involved in the nation's worst air crash 10 years ago.United Airlines declined to comment on the number of survivors or to release the names of the 282 passengers and 11 crew members.He said the huge mass of the DC-10 must have helped the pilot slow the plane as it approached the ground and helped keep portions of it intact.C. Haynes -- a 33-year veteran of the airline who along with the other 10 crew members survived the crash -- struggled for a half-hour to maintain control of the wobbling plane.The search for bodies was difficult because some of them were scattered in the cornfield.He said rescuers pulled out three of the flight crew alive.The second-worst crash in U.S. history was an Aug.Wednesday's tragedy was the worst in a recent series of accidents and mishaps involving United.Hewitt Graham, manager of Graham Flying Service, a charter service and corporate aircraft maintenance firm that operates out of the building closest to the crash site, said he was in his office, answering phones, when five crash victims -- a man, his wife and young son and two other men -- walked in.He said a smaller plane, such as a DC-9, would have been far more likely to break up more severely.
