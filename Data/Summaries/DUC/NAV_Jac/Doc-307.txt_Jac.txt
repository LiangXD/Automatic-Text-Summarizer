Clint Bolick, vice president of the Institute for Justice in Washington and a close friend of Judge Thomas, says that the weekend hearings will deepen his sympathy for victims and "will reconfirm his very strong belief in individual rights."Judge Thomas will have an opportunity to apply his criminal-law views in the case of Jacobson vs. U.S., which is scheduled to be argued next month.Judge Thomas wouldn't be able to vote on the case unless the Supreme Court asks the parties to reargue it once he is on the bench.Judge Thomas is by no means the first Supreme Court appointee to have weathered scandal.The issue that dominated the first round of Judge Thomas's hearings last month, was abortion-the most contentious issue before the court.Others are concerned that the Supreme Court as an institution will be diminished for having Judge Thomas on the bench, even though Prof. Hill's allegations of misconduct were not proven.During the hearing, Judge Thomas made plain his abhorrence of sexual harassment.But John Danforth, Judge Thomas's most passionate defender in the Senate, says going through the "agonies of hell" has made Clarence Thomas "more sensitive to civil rights, to the necessity of legal protection of the people of this country, than most people who could conceivably be nominated for the Supreme Court."Here's a look at issues on which legal experts think Judge Thomas's thinking may be affected:Democrats questioned Judge Thomas's credibility when he insisted not only that he didn't have an opinion on Roe vs. Wade, the abortion-rights landmark Supreme Court decision, but also that he had never discussed the 1973 case.Conservative legal commentator Bruce Fein, who had been a Thomas supporter, says the Senate should have rejected the nominee because "the Supreme Court has got to be an institution that's above suspicion.The bitter battle over Judge Thomas's treatment of Anita Hill has pushed a relatively obscure case called Franklin vs. Gwinnett County (Ga.) into the limelight because it involves sexual harassment.Claudia Withers of the Women's Legal Defense Fund says that such expressions of hostility by Judge Thomas "give us the concern that he wouldn't look favorably on claims" by interest groups that advocate abortion rights before the Supreme Court and that also opposed his nomination.As Judge Thomas helps decide controversial cases over the years, the specter of Anita Hill's lurid allegations will almost certainly be evident.One legal expert who knows Judge Thomas well is convinced that the new justice will be very negative about any issue enhancing congressional powers.There are no cases involving press freedoms on the court's docket and Judge Thomas has had very limited First Amendment experience, a gap that gave the American Bar Association reservations about the nominee.Even if he hadn't gone through the agony of the past two weeks, Judge Thomas would have been a crucial addition to the court, which is closely divided on such extraordinarily important issues as abortion, religious expression, and free speech.But Ms. Campbell is hopeful that Judge Thomas will be sympathetic to victims of such discrimination, in part to rehabilitate his reputation.As a result, she argues, Judge Thomas will be more likely to rule against the interests of civil rights organizations and women's groups that opposed him.The slightest utterance from Judge Thomas during this argument is bound to be dissected and will be imbued with special meaning.
