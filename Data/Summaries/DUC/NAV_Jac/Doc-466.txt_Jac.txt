Dr. Kinlen, who directs the university's Cancer Epidemiology Unit, examined leukemia deaths from a U.S. study that had tracked veterans' smoking between 1954 and 1969.Dr. Kinlen found veterans who had smoked more than 21 cigarettes a day were the most likely to die from myeloid leukemia, the most common form of the disease in middle-aged people.The earlier study tallied overall deaths from various causes, including 723 deaths due to leukemia.If the link is causal, an editorial in the medical journal said, "then smoking is a more important cause of leukemia in adults than all other known causes combined.""The balance of evidence suggests that smoking may cause leukemia," Dr. Wald wrote in an accompanying commentary on the analysis, which was conducted by University of Edinburgh epidemiologist Leo Kinlen.
