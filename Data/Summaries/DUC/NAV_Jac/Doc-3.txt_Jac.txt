The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the "mad cow" scare."Mad cow" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the $3.7-billion British beef industry.Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently.Beef sales dropped, with surveys showing that about a quarter of British households had stopped eating it.Despite assurances from the British government that the beef is safe, consumers and some scientists remain skeptical.Therefore, British officials believe, France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales.Some regulations were enacted to fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne said her family was still eating British beef."BSE has been around for six or seven years," said David Lewis of the Meat and Livestock Commission.
