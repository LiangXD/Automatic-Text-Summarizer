Gun control was never an issue in America until after the Civil War when black slaves were freed.The 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, along with the various Reconstruction civil rights acts, prevented gun prohibitionists from making laws that were explicitly racist and that would overtly deny black people the right to bear arms.The specter of a black man with rights of a freeman, bearing arms, was too much for the early heirs of Roger Taney to bear.Scott appealed to the federal courts, since the person he was actually suing, John Sanford, the executor of the estate that owned Scott, lived in New York.In Dred Scott Chief Justice Taney, writing for the court's majority, stated that if blacks were "entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, . . . {i}t would give persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one state of the union, the right . . . to keep and carry arms wherever they went.That black people, whether free or slave, were not citizens of the U.S.; therefore, they had no standing in court.
