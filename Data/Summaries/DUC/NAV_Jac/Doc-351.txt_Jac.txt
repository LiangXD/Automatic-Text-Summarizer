But even worse, others are being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.I'm here today to explain to the people of Iraq why the United States and the world community has responded the way it has to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.I do not believe that you, the people of Iraq, want war.Because of Iraq's aggression, hundreds of thousands of innocent foreign workers are fleeing Kuwait and Iraq.The United Nations has put binding sanctions in place, not to punish the Iraqi people, but as a peaceful means to convince your leadership to withdraw from Kuwait.That decision is in the hands of Saddam Hussein.Iraq must get out of Kuwait -- for the sake of principle, for the sake of peace and for the sake of the Iraqi people.Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between Iraq and America.Here is the text of President Bush's address to the people of Iraq, as released by the White House:In fact, the occupation of Kuwait is helping no one and is now hurting you, the Iraqi people, and countless others of the world's poor.Ultimately, Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait.Let me say clearly, there is no way Iraq can win.When we stand with Kuwait against aggression, we stand for a principle well understood in the Arab world.Saddam Hussein tells you the occupation of Kuwait will benefit the poorer nations of the world.We have no quarrel with the people of Iraq.I do not want to add to the suffering of the people of Iraq.But while those actions have brought us to the brink of conflict, war is not inevitable.
