LIMA -- On June 4, I was among a group of journalists who were told that the war against the Shining Path ("Sendero Luminoso") guerrillas had almost been won.The Shining Path went to war in 1980, on the same day Peru was holding general elections after 12 years of a military dictatorship.Nevertheless, it was a very important and unexpected police coup against the Shining Path -- one that probably could have brought dramatic results if President Alan Garcia had not decided to make public the operation so soon after the first police intervention, in order to score a quick propaganda gain.In October 1981, emergency laws were imposed for the first time on part of Peru; they covered only 2% of the population.He also feels that the Shining Path is weakened, and that an important Shining Path faction would be willing to engage in peace talks.This is only wishful thinking, according to Mr. Merino: "If President Fujimori thinks he'll finish the war through those 'pacification' policies, it will be like riding into battle with no better dress or weapons than a tuxedo."According to Francisco Loayza, Mr. Fujimori's adviser on internal-security matters, military actions against the Shining Path should be subordinated to economic-development initiatives.His campaign pitch advocated an approach closely resembling that of Mr. Garcia's first year.In 10 years, the war between the Shining Path and the government has cost about 20,000 lives.At first, he tried a liberal approach, looking for a dialogue with the fanatical Shining Path, and sending scores of young professionals to the emergency areas to attack what he said were the "root causes" of the insurgency.
