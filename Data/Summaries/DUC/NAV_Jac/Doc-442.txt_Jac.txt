Mr Kraai van Niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on continued political reform in South Africa, and Prieska is the centre of his constituency.Mr van Niekerk concedes that such suggestions contain an element of truth But the drought is also an established fact and there are socio-economic as well as agricultural reasons why as many farmers as possible should be saved.Indeed, I had expected that the arid area in which the minister's own farm is situated would be suffering most.But in the meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow.Today Prieska relies almost entirely on agriculture and in both prosperity and population it is only half the town it once was.As the minister said, that is a long way ahead and there will be time to make arrangements to deal with that problem should it occur.Whichever way you look at it this is a crucial time for South Africa.It is, in fact, the arable farmers further east who are suffering most, as I had seen and heard for myself a few days earlier, and Mr van Niekerk has already set up committees of bankers, extension officers and local farmers' representatives, to try to find ways to avoid many of them going bankrupt.
