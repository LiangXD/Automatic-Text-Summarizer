He says the bank's main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a 'balanced relationship between government and the market' in developing countries.'The Brady plan is enough,' says Mr Williamson, if developing countries are willing to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of official debt.Mr Summers, the bank's economist, says pessimistically that because development money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and other donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas.This is both because countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the bank's policies were sometimes misguided.As incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank's strategies for promoting development.Many Third World countries have gone backwards.'The morale of staff is lousy,' says Mr Charles Flickner, a senior analyst on the Senate Budget Committee and close observer of the bank.The challenge for Mr Preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles of the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis on the formation of human capital.'Liberalisation matters,' says Mr Williamson at the Institute for International Economics, 'but education is more important.'The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private sector.Should a significant chunk of the bank's loans be made direct to the private sector?The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach strict political conditions to its loans.Advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sector are surely not arguing for public subsidies for Third World entrepreneurs; but if subsidies are ruled out, why should the bank's judgment of market risk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west?One problem is that it has lost leverage over many Third World governments.Development economists, meanwhile, are urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year's World Development Report and focus more on poverty alleviation.Such values are alien in many developing countries, but that does not imply they should be denied the means for economic development.'It is not an impressive bureaucracy,' says Mr John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics.
