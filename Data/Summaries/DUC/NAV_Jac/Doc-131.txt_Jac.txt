It also was the first time Kristiansen had beaten Samuelson in a marathon.It had been at least eight years since Samuelson was beaten in the marathon by an American.It was the first time since 1963 that an Ethiopian had run at Boston and Mekonnen, 24, made the most of it.For the first few miles, before the heat, Kristiansen was running at a 2:17 pace.Joan Benoit Samuelson, who set a world record on this course in 1983, was beset with physical problems that altered her stride at 11 miles, and she finished ninth among the women in 2:37:52."I was prepared for hot weather and it certainly was hot, but the heat wasn't my problem today," Samuelson said."I've run some very good races and I think I have some very good races left in me," she said.In an emotional news conference afterward, Samuelson, who won the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984 at Los Angeles, tearfully conceded that she might have run her last marathon for some time.It was only the second time an African has won here.Samuelson, who holds the U.S. marathon record, said she will significantly decrease her training mileage and probably run shorter races.But the story of Monday's 93rd Boston race was Mekonnen and his nation of 42 million, which has reemerged as a force to be reckoned with in marathon running.I was right where I wanted to be.He was among the pack of four African runners that led the 6,418 entrants race for 15 miles.And they ran not as strangers, because Mekonnen had beaten Ikangaa in winning last year's Tokyo Marathon.Also on Sunday, in the World Cup Marathon at Milan, Ethiopians finished 1-2."It was too hot to set the world record."In two days, Ethiopian runners have won three major marathons.By her own reckoning, it was at almost 16 miles that Kristiansen felt the heat.THEY'VE GOT A LOCK ON THE MARATHON How Ethiopia's marathoners have fared the last two days:One of the marathon's most enduring figures was Bikila, who won the marathon gold medal in 1960 and 1964.Now it is Abebe Mekonnen, who was born the year Bikila won the 1964 Olympic Marathon in Tokyo and a nation named its baby boys after its hero.I think I need to take an indefinite rest.I think it's great that she finished."Samuelson, who had knee surgery in February, continued to fade as her stride faltered and was beaten by three U.S. runners."I felt real easy the first 11 miles, I felt I was right in the groove.And still another, Wodajo Bulti, who has run 2:08:44, is one of the favorites in the London Marathon next Sunday.
