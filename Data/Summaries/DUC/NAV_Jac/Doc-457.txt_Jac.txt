Mr Patten has said, however, that what he finally proposes has to be 'acceptable to the people of Hong Kong'.The governor said he was prepared to discuss these alternatives with China but reminded legislators that any alternatives had to be fair, open and command the support of the people of Hong Kong.THE SHARP deterioration in relations between Britain and China over Hong Kong's political future has cast a pall over the colony's financial markets.On Friday, Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, said Beijing would challenge the validity of future elections and abrogate agreements to build the colony's multi-billion dollar airport if Mr Patten proceeded without China's agreement.During the special sitting of LegCo, Mr Patten proposals were endorsed by liberal politicians and some independents.Since then China has found fault with two alternative financing proposals put to it by the Hong Kong government.Such a head-to-head contest between Beijing and Britain's governor in Hong Kong would be without precedent in the colony.Relations between the UK and China have deteriorated markedly since Mr Patten, with the general support of the Hong Kong people, announced proposals on October 7 for elections in 1994 and 1995 which would allow for greater, though still limited, democracy in choosing local leaders.
