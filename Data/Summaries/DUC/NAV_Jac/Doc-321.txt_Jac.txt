A Milken spokesman said that no decision had been made on whether to appeal the sentence.Wood said evidence presented during a pre-sentencing hearing in October convinced her that Milken had committed additional serious crimes beyond the six felony counts he pleaded guilty to in April.April 24, 1990: Milken tearfully pleads guilty to six felonies, agrees to pay $600 million in restitution and fines, and agrees to cooperate with the government after sentencing.The judge said she would consider reducing the sentence if prosecutors eventually certify to her that Milken has cooperated fully.During the sentencing, Wood derided defense claims that Milken was basically law-abiding and that if he were not, he would have committed more blatant crimes, such as insider trading.Although Milken technically could be paroled almost immediately, government lawyers said the commission normally requires prisoners to serve close to two-thirds of their sentence.Wood's sentence was viewed as a rebuff to many prominent Southern Californians who had written to her urging that Milken's sentence be limited to community service.Milken's lawyers, however, said that Milken's lifestyle was relatively modest and unmaterialistic.Wood also sentenced him to three years of community service while on probation after his prison sentence.Milken had pleaded guilty to six felony securities law violations last April.She said the government also did not prove its claim that Milken was guilty of insider trading in Caesars World securities in 1983, and also failed to show that he had illegally made lucrative investment opportunities available to employees of investment funds as inducements to get them to buy riskier securities for their funds.In Milken's case, that would be about six years.Charles Carberry, a lawyer who once headed the U.S. attorney's securities fraud unit in New York, said: "I think it was a clear message that he should cooperate."The judge said Milken also had made remarks to employees in the Beverly Hills office in November, 1986, which could only be interpreted as instructions to destroy documents.James Slade, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons, said that under Justice Department rules, the 10-year term makes it unlikely that Milken will be allowed to serve his sentence in a minimum-security federal prison camp.At Liman's request, the judge agreed to sentence Milken under a provision of federal law that allows him to be paroled at any time at the discretion of the federal parole commission.A federal judge sentenced an apparently stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in prison Wednesday after ruling that the crimes he pleaded guilty to were neither minor nor isolated.During his own lawyer's presentation before sentence was imposed, Milken at times was in tears in the courtroom.The judge said she based the sentence only on evidence of specific crimes presented in court.John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor, said the judge may also have imposed the severe sentence because Milken occupied a position of trust at the center of the financial world.21, 1990: Milken is sentenced to 10 years in jail, plus three years' probation, plus 1,800 hours of community service.She said there was insufficient evidence to prove that Milken was behind a manipulation of WickesCos. stock in 1986.The sentence could be reduced if Milken cooperates with the government in ongoing and future investigations.But as investigators closed in, Milken was forced to resign from Drexel in 1989, after he was named in a 99-count racketeering indictment and the firm itself pleaded guilty to six felony counts.U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said the unexpectedly long prison term is meant to make an example of the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king, whose innovative use of high-yield, high-risk bonds had fueled the corporate takeover frenzy of the 1980s.Several lawyers said they interpreted the long sentence as an attempt by the judge to ensure that Milken cooperates fully, revealing whatever incriminating information he knows about corporate raiders, junk bond buyers and former co-workers.June 15, 1989: Milken resigns after 19 years at Drexel to form his own consulting firm.She said that an equally likely explanation was that Milken was simply afraid to do anything too blatant.But she said that was not enough to make up for his crimes.Under federal court rulings, Wood is allowed to consider evidence of other crimes in deciding on a sentence.But in those cases, the defendants had fully cooperated with the government before their sentencing, turning in prominent former business associates.
