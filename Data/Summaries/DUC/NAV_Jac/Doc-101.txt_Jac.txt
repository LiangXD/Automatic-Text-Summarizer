The cause of the fire near Stanislaus National Forest, near Yosemite, was a "bottle rocket," said the forest's spokeswoman, Mary Hale.At least 60 Forest Service firefighters brought the Hiawatha forest fire under control Monday, spokesman Dale Bluedorn said from the national forest's headquarters in Escanaba, Mich."We're going to start releasing crews from this fire," Bluedorn said.Firefighters, aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity, reported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained Monday afternoon and hoped to have a line surrounding the fire early Tuesday morning, Hale said.
