"We will have the money to finish the project," says Alastair Morton, British deputy chairman of Eurotunnel, the privately owned Anglo-French company overseeing the work.Eurotunnel Chairman Andre Benard said the company has provided for any foreseeable problems, but stressed: "We always made it very clear that this was a risk project."While the French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link to their end of the tunnel, for example, state-owned British Rail is dragging."Britain becomes branch line of Europe," a Guardian newspaper headline declared after the government announced June 14 that it would not fund a high-speed rail link between London and the British end of the tunnel.It's been described as the largest current civil engineering project, a multibillion dollar link that will help revolutionize Europe's economy and physically end Britain's historic isolation, a dream born in Napoleon's day.Eurotunnel says is can survive without a new link.Eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent of Britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the first year.The "Chunnel" between Britain and France is half-dug and scheduled to open on time in three years.Assuming banks approve, the project would have a total of about $14.6 billion in debt and equity financing.
