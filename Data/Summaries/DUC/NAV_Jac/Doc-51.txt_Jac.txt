"Tornadoes are very rare in Japan," Fujita said."It's a beautiful thing," Fujita said.Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado.Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research."In Texas one time, five people were killed when they drove right into a tornado.He also developed the Fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes.Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, but are more dangerous because they give pilots less time to react, Fujita said.Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953, partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country.Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982.When he saw his first tornado, he and a team of scientists were studying wind shear and its effect on aircraft.But Fujita has helped define the conditions most likely to spawn them."It was like meeting my lover," he says."If you're in it," he added, "it's a terrible thing."
