CHINA yesterday delivered an open challenge to Britain's continued administration of Hong Kong when it said it would repudiate all commercial agreements made by the colonial government that were not first agreed with Beijing.The challenge was immediately rejected by the Hong Kong government, which accused China of violating Anglo-Chinese agreements and its own law for Hong Kong which comes into force after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in June 1997.Analysts in Hong Kong said it also amounted to a bid by China for greater involvement in the colony's administration.
