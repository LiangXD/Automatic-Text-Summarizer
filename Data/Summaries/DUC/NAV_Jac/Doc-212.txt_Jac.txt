The garden is landscaped into four plant zones, with the most flammable vegetation planted farthest from the house.It's designed to be a greenbelt zone of maximum fire protection.The Firescapes Demonstration Garden is located across the street from City Fire Station 7 at 2411 Stanwood Drive and is open every day from 8 a.m. until sunset.The concept behind the garden is that while no plant is fireproof, some are more flammable than others.One popular plant found almost everywhere in Southern California -- ice plant -- would seem to be an ideal choice for a firescape garden.The garden is a model of how to design and maintain landscaping around the home to provide a line of defense against fire."The idea behind fire-resistant landscaping -- firescaping -- is to design landscaping to minimize the fire hazard," says Owen Dell, a Santa Barbara landscape contractor who has many canyon and hillside homeowners as clients.Some trees and plants are surprisingly hazardous.Dell, the Santa Barbara City Fire Department, the city government and a number of volunteers combined their efforts and began planning the Santa Barbara Firescapes Demonstration Garden to educate the public about reducing the risks of wildfire near their homes.Turn left and continue to the fire station, on your left, just opposite the garden.Zone 1, closest to the residence, is a small area of plants that pose little risk of burning.
