"The phenomenon is just awe-inspiring."; Solar eclipses occur twice a year, when the sun, moon and earth line up.(This line-up would occur at every new moon, except that the moon's orbit is tilted so it only crosses the sun's path every six months.); Because of variations in the moon's orbit, fewer than a third of the solar eclipses are total eclipses.
