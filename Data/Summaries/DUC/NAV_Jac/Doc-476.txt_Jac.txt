Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05.Yet 41 states are still at or below the current federal level.Moreover, the quoted minimum wage for a state is often deceptive.Moreover, 13 states have minimums below the federal level and nine have no minimum at all.California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages.At the same time, if a state's minimum is higher than the federal minimum, the state minimum applies.Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living.
