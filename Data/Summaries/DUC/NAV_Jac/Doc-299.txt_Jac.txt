This, in fact, may have been one reason why the load on the United flight was light.If preliminary reports that there was wind shear in the area are true, then "that would indicate there was some instability in the atmosphere," he added.In Sunday's crash, the jetliner was a few miles from the airport and so should have been at a somewhat higher altitude.Yesterday's marks the third crash of a United jet in the past three years.Moments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23 miles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, Mr. Hall said.The jet, which can hold at least 100 passengers, carried 20 passengers and a crew of two pilots and three flight attendants.
