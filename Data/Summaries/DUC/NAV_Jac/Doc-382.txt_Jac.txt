The remaining 14 states and the District of Columbia have laws banning polygraph examinations for employment purposes, and these laws take precedence over the new federal statute if they are more restrictive, according to Goldberg."We expect that the new law will ban 80 percent of the approximately 2 million polygraph tests given annually," Goldberg said in a prepared statement.The law's restrictions will be felt most heavily in 28 states that lack their own statutes restricting the use of lie detectors, Goldberg said.
