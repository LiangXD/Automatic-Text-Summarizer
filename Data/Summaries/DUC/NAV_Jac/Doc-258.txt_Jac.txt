Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley, was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance.Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into Iowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said.But drought aid cut farmers' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a North Dakota State University study found.Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been just $6,300.Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the state still needs "a good year to get back on our feet," Hauck said."Disaster aid is political," he said.About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms in Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres."It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster," said Dwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist.Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other drought-ravaged states, including Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin."If it hadn't been for drought aid, the economic situation all through North Dakota would have been disastrous."The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid," Grindberg said.Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, he said, "I was able to mark time in '88. ..."I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area," Grindberg added.
