(Johnson disagrees.); At the end of "Speed Trap," Francis says that steroids cannot be simply banned -- their use is too prevalent, they can be disguised too easily and they work too well.Francis would have us believe that without steroids, Johnson cannot be the fastest.No one of Johnson's standing had been caught before.That's one of Francis' theories for why Johnson got caught.; But, Francis says, there is no logical reason for Johnson to have been caught.By encouraging his athletes to use steroids -- and Francis maintains that they all wanted to do so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up -- Francis argues that he is simply helping to create a level playing field.; We learn that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is nothing new in the world of sports -- that cocaine and arsenic and codeine were used by athletes in the 1896 Olympic Games.What did he really feel toward Johnson?; After a two-year ban, Johnson is running again without Francis' coaching.And because of that testimony, we have "Speed Trap," an elaboration of what Francis said at the inquiry and a history of his remarkable path through the world of track and field.; He argues, essentially, that to be a world-class sprinter, you must use steroids -- he makes this argument even as Johnson attempts a comeback for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, without them.; Steroids do not make a runner run faster, Francis explains, but they enable a runner to train harder.
