It looks to us as if Clarence Thomas is the first Justice to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court with a popular mandate.But history will note that at the moment Clarence Thomas was about to be destroyed by the old order, the American people came forward and by the millions confirmed his appointment to the Supreme Court.They can't possibly have wanted the sexual harassment charge against Clarence Thomas to go before the entire American population.This doesn't mean that the American people support Judge Thomas -- or Robert Bork or Ronald Reagan -- in every detail of their political beliefs.We have argued continuously during these years that this argument was false, that the voters had indeed entrusted Ronald Reagan with a mandate (his campaign positions were clear) and that the losing side was trying to overturn the results of these elections.Black Americans have perhaps the greatest sorting out to do.The difference, however, between the American people and the permanent political establishment in Washington is that Washington no longer feels constrained by the American political system.
