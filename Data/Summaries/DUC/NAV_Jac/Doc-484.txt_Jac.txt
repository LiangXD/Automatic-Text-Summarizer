"Mine has always been that it's unlikely, because I think people tend to act as crews when they get in an experience that is prolonged," Connors said.It's unlikely, all agree, that any of the eight crew members to be selected later this year from among 14 candidates in this $30 million private experiment, will go bonkers.He and Connors also said most studies of crews, including mixed-sex groups in environments far harsher and smaller than the biospherians are likely to encounter, have shown them to be highly motivated, energetic and willing to put up with almost anything for the sake of the project and the team's success."Given the fact that various members of the clergy have shown themselves to be innovative and agreeable to doing marriages under very unusual circumstances, I'm sure that they could find a way to do it," Ms. Dyhr said."Let's just put it this way," Ms. Dyhr said, "there's nothing really that a corporation can do about what their employees do after 5 o'clock.Bechtel said the public has a misconception that putting eight people together will mean "all kinds of interesting things can happen."Bechtel said: "How could you avoid it?"They're so highly motivated in the first place, I would not be surprised to see the whole thing go through without a hitch, personnel-wise," said Robert B. Bechtel, an environmental psychologist at the University of Arizona.Connors and Bechtel said the strong job focus, cross-work training and the fact that the potential crew members have worked and spent significant time together all are highly advantageous.
