"There is an emergency in the emergency room right now in not only New York and Boston but around the country and for a variety of reasons," said Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.The fibers, including Kevlar now used to make bulletproof vests, also could be used to make some body parts, and El-Shiekh is working with Duke University researchers on ceramic "stents," collapsible braces for arteries."The bottom line is that emergency care is being squeezed," Raske said.San Antonio, the nation's ninth largest city, with a population that is 50 percent Hispanic, is becoming the base for diabetes studies.Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population, and 40 percent of the 700,000 victims in Texas are Mexican-American."The day may very well come when you are driving around with car engine parts of ceramic fiber," he said, adding that the vibration-damping properties of the materials also would make them good for torsion bars in cars."We believe if they can take the ceramic fibers they need and the machinery we're developing they would be able to literally make the space stations they will need as they go," said El-Shiekh, a mechanical engineer at working in North Carolina State University's textiles school.
