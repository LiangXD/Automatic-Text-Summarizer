Stephen A. Wynn, who owns 29.4% of Golden Nugget's shares, says the Mirage and other projects will help Las Vegas attract a whole new generation of visitors."If you don't know what you are, bigger won't make you better," he says.Not for 15 years has a big new hotel-casino opened here."Two generations ago, Dad came to Las Vegas by himself for a little diversion," says Van Heffner, executive vice president of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association.Caesars has made a specialty of catering to high rollers from abroad, who are also being aggressively courted by the Mirage, the Las Vegas Hilton and others.If MGM Grand Inc. proceeds with its plan for an amusement park -- a $700 million movieland resort with a working studio, casino and 5,000-room hotel that would become Las Vegas's biggest -- the investment in the three properties will total some $1.6 billion.City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44% of Las Vegas tourists who fly here.The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 75,500.Last year, the tourists left $3 billion with the area's casinos, nearly 10% more than in 1987."There's probably going to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over the next year, but after that you should see the market return to 80%-plus occupancy and regular rates," says Paul Rubeli, casino executive at Ramada Inc., which runs the Tropicana."There's still room for boutique properties," says James Barrett, president of MarCor Resorts Inc."More rooms aren't the answer for us," says Caesars World chairman Henry Gluck.Some casino owners have resisted the temptation to add rooms.By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room, Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs.Off the Strip, MarCor is building the Rio, a hotel-casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites.Hotel expansion and an influx of more-discriminating tourists have hurt motels."The days when when the thrust of casinos was all high rollers, with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor, are gone," Mr. Sain of the visitors' bureau says.Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high.Now the Mirage and Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.'s $290 million Excalibur are going up.This is the Mirage, a $630 million island-fantasy hotel-casino now being completed for opening in November by Golden Nugget Inc.Other casino owners, Circus Circus among them, are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as First Interstate Bank of Nevada.Atlantic City casino owner Donald Trump is scouting the Las Vegas market with an eye toward building an appropriately spectacular place.Even before the huge new projects began, the Strip's recent expansion squeezed smaller competitors.After all, 40,000 newcomers a year are settling in the Las Vegas Valley.Despite the proliferation of tourist distractions, Las Vegans haven't forgot that gambling is still what the town is all about.Competitors and analysts say that among large existing properties Bally Manufacturing Corp.'s Bally Grand hotel-casino probably will be hardest hit among major properties.
