The 44-year-old Leland, a Democrat, was making his sixth tour of refugee camps along the Ethiopia-Sudan border as chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, a panel he had helped to establish five years ago.Wheat, who was among those who had pressed Defense Department officials for the deployment of more aircraft in the search, said after the discovery Sunday: "We could have brought every plane in the world that we have, and it would not have made a difference."Alan Wheat (D-Mo.), who with Ackerman had been flying with search crews for the last two days, said he telephoned House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) from Addis Ababa soon after the discovery was made.Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.), a colleague of Leland's who has accompanied search crews for the last two days and was aboard the helicopter that first spotted the wreckage Sunday.The surveyor was taken aboard, crew members said, but on their way toward their destination they spotted the crash site.The crash site is about 75 miles east of the Fugnido refugee camp that Leland was flying to visit when the plane vanished in heavy weather last Monday."The terrain was fairly rugged and the weather conditions were bad getting there," said Capt.Presently, the crew found an Ethiopian surveyor who said he could guide them to an area near where the plane had been heard.President Bush, in his Sunday statement, said: "I have known, admired and worked with Mickey Leland for many years.Ackerman said that the plane appeared to have hit "nose first, right into the rocks; its two wings sheared off, its engines melted, its fuselage gone."Crew members described the site as "mostly rocks and brush" and indicated that the pilot of Leland's plane may have been trying to escape bad weather on Monday by following the pathway of a river flowing through a valley.Ackerman said that the helicopter he was traveling in set down during the morning at an airstrip near the village of Dembi Dolo.Leland was a former Houston pharmacist who called the fight against hunger "my passion."He said that Foley was "heartbroken" at the news.U.S. military helicopters on Sunday located the wreckage of a plane that crashed last Monday with Texas congressman Mickey Leland and 15 others aboard.The crash site was described by U.S. authorities as being about 20 nautical miles due east of the town of Gambela and 230 nautical miles west-southwest of Addis Ababa.Leland represented the best in compassion that we as a nation possess."Discovery of the crash site came at about 1:15 p.m. local time Sunday.Discovery of the crash site ended what had been one of the most extensive American search and rescue operations ever conducted in a Third World country.Witnesses who visited the site said there were no survivors.
