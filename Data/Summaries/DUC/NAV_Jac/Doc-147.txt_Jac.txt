With the decline of communism, U.S. development groups believe they are exporting free-market economics to tiny businesses that can fuel growth in the developing world.Some Third World banks, notably in Asia, have been making microloans for years.Accion, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit international development group and a leader in the U.S. microloan movement, says it plans to increase its microlending this year to $66.5 million from $37.8 million in 1990 and $9.8 million five years ago.CARE, New York, perhaps the world's largest private international-development group, says small economic-activity development -- primarily microlending -- is its fastest-growing portfolio.Trickle Up, which makes thousands of $100 loans annually, says its budget rose to $1 million this year from $800,000 in 1989 after doubling almost every year throughout the 1980s.Repayment rates in most nations exceed 90%, she says.She says microlending to individuals in 20 nations is rising sharply, with more than $3 million in circulation at the moment."These people value access to credit so highly that default isn't really a problem," she says.Though microlending has been around for years, it is now booming.
