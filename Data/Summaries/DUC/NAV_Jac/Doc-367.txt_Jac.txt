In his own confirmation hearings, "many senators wanted political results from the courts," Bork said.Among consequences of this trend toward politicization of the courts, Bork said, is that "we may expect (judicial) confirmation battles that are increasingly bitter.On the matter of Bork's leanings on possible Supreme Court action on the abortion issue, "I was told by two Republican senators that they would vote against me because I might vote to overturn Roe against Wade," Bork said.But this "tempting," or political manipulation of the courts, long predated his attempt to secure a seat on the Supreme Court, Bork said.By politicizing the courts, Bork elaborated, Americans have eaten away at "the people's right to legislate the laws we want to live by."Constitutional law, in short, Bork said, has come to be seen as "a political weapon."Whereas the Constitution specified that laws were to be made by legislators who were elected by the people, not judges appointed by the President, Bork said, "a lot of Americans now simply assume that the courts should produce results they like rather than sticking to the Constitution."The angry sessions were marked by a level of communication that was "not very high," Bork said.In that spirit, one of the latest to join the parade of let-me-tell-you-my-side authors is Robert H. Bork, the former appeals court judge who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Reagan but was rejected by the Senate.Both sides, Bork said, "regard the court as in large part not a legal institution, but a political body.""So far as they were concerned, for their purposes, the Supreme Court was their branch."Bork's constitutional expertise was one of the qualities that Reagan said figured strongly in his decision to nominate Bork for the Supreme Court and to support Bork's decision to tough out his bitter, ultimately unsuccessful five-month fight for the position in 1987."At bottom," he said, his new book is "about legal theory."Though without its subtitle, "The Political Seduction of the Law," a book called "The Tempting of America" does sound rather like a collection of regional dessert recipes, Bork maintains that mass assumption explains "the great temptation," expecting "political results from the courts."But as the protesters proceeded up Capitol Hill, "they went straight past both houses of Congress with nary a pause, and straight to the Supreme Court," Bork said.
