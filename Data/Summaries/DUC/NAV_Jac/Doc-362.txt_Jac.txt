Law is just politics, judges just politicians in robes.The campaign against Judge Bork is shrill, mean and anti-intellectualan assault on the notion of law itself.Not one of the 416 opinions he has written or joined has been overturned by the Supreme Court.Judge Bork is the leading proponent of judicial restraint.Judge Robert Bork is the most qualified American alive to serve on the Supreme Court.Any likely alternative, such as Orrin Hatch, would be a much more activist judge, though a far less distinguished one.Despite his pre-eminent qualifications, in the last few weeks an awful fury has been unleashed against Judge Bork, centered on the canard that he is somehow outside the legal mainstream.His critics are living evidence of how badly he is needed on the Supreme Court.Legal resumes get no better than Judge Bork's.This doctrine is nothing more radical than the assumption of our constitutional democracy that judges must be the "least dangerous branch."One case where Judge Bork ruled for a labor union against a federal agency was classified by critics as "pro-business" because unions are "in the business" of representing workers.
