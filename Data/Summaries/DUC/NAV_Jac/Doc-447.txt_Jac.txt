Researchers still use seismometers and other instruments to measure the trembling, quaking and bulging of the ground that often spell danger.; But the technology has improved immensely:; (check) Instruments are cheaper and more expendable, so they can be deployed where they will do the most good -- right in the path of the volcano's fury.; (check) The instruments continually beam data to scientists who are waiting a safe distance away.Now tiltmeters are inexpensive enough to place in areas likely to get wiped out in eruptions.; The humble seismometer has also grown more useful as scientists learn to better interpret what it's saying.; "Volcanoes are probably the most complex structures you can find on this planet," said Bernard Chouet, a seismologist at the USGS in Menlo Park.; It's not unusual for them to produce thousands of small earthquakes -- but those quakes can have a variety of causes.These patterns were successfully used to forecast the 1989 eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, as well as the current eruptions at Pinatubo.; But even though volcano warnings have proved far more accurate than earthquake forecasts, they're far from foolproof.; Some volcanoes give virtually no warning."It was a rather remarkable decade, really."; Scientists say the eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed 57 people and caused $1 billion in property damage, triggered a renaissance in volcano research.; It alerted the American public to volcano hazards and prompted a tenfold increase in government spending for volcano research and monitoring, said geologist Robert Tilling of USGS in Menlo Park.; As a result, the survey opened two new volcano observatories.Such a quick response is crucial because only a few dozen of the world's 500 active volcanoes have been adequately investigated and monitored.; "Now," Tilling said, "we can go in there and literally overnight set up a seismic network, and start getting data within a day or two."; The blossoming research has in turn spurred development of cheaper and more rugged instruments.; Take tiltmeters.; Like glorified carpenters' levels, they are used to measure the bulging and tilting of the ground as magma muscles its way toward the surface.; A decade ago they cost thousands of dollars each."Our biggest improvement has been in our own heads," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.; These skills were honed in a series of volcanic disasters that rocked the world over the past decade.; "The 1980s was a very interesting decade because of the number of eruptions that have occurred for which we have good monitoring information," said Steven Brantley, a geologist with the survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.Researchers are learning to distinguish ordinary earthquakes from those caused by magma rising toward the surface -- a sign of impending eruption.; 4.But others are ominous, reflecting the surge of magma toward the surface in preparation for an eruption.; In the past few years, Chouet said, seismologists have learned to recognize distinctive tremors that mean an eruption is on its way.
