The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.The committee's report, released early this year, said it is only a "shrewd guess" that BSE was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.The Southwood report said it was "most unlikely" that the disease was a threat to humans.
