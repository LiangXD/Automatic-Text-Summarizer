Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwood said.And they don't necessarily have to be mad at the Forest Service."An arson case in the forest is very hard to make," he said.The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set.He said Mark Twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem."It's just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary (deliberately set) fires," McDonald said.Beyond the cost in dollars of forest fires, there's risk to those who fight them.In the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed, Smallwood said.McDonald, who oversees about 125 Mark Twain employees trained as firefighters, said forest fires cost $25 to $30 an acre to suppress.A split, charred tree stump is a clue that lightning was to blame for a forest fire."Part of it is tradition," Smallwood said.
