Sources at the firm said the indictment of Michael Milken probably would clear the way for Drexel to swiftly settle civil charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Immediately after the 98-count indictment was returned by a federal grand jury, Drexel said that Milken, 42, and his brother, 40, had requested and been granted leaves of absence.The 110-page indictment returned Wednesday appears to closely follow the civil charges contained in an SEC lawsuit filed in September against Drexel and the Milkens.The indictment notes that Milken received $1.1 billion in direct compensation from Drexel from 1984 through 1987, as well as millions in other forms of compensation, and that he is Drexel's largest individual stockholder, owning about 6% of the firm.If convicted on the racketeering charges, the three could face an astronomical amount in financial penalties: The indictment asks that they forfeit a total of $1.85 billion, representing their salaries, other compensation and their share of Drexel profits, all earned in what the government charges was a continuing criminal enterprise operated at the New York-based investment banking firm.According to the indictment, Milken's pay was $123.8 million in 1984 and $135 million in 1985, then more than doubled in 1986 to $294.8 million.Among other charges, the indictment alleges that Drexel used Princeton/Newport to illegally manipulate the price of COMB Co. securities in 1985."The second RICO indictment of Mr. Newberg, containing essentially the same charges as those in the first indictment, is a total perversion of the RICO statute," the lawyers said.Michael Milken said in a written press release: "I am confident that in the end I will be vindicated."Drexel's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges pending against the firm calls for it to withhold nearly all of Michael Milken's compensation from 1988, as well as about $13 million owed to Lowell Milken.The charges filed Wednesday mean that Newberg is now facing two separate racketeering indictments.Michael Milken, the Drexel Burnham Lambert "junk bond" wizard in Beverly Hills who revolutionized U.S. corporate finance and raised funds for dozens of corporate raids, was indicted Wednesday on federal racketeering, insider trading and other securities fraud counts.Michael Armstrong, Lowell's lawyer, said in a brief interview that he found little that was unexpected in the indictment.He said his office has been negotiating with the defendants' lawyers and added that he expects a bond to be posted by the three men, covering at least a part of the amount they may be required to forfeit to the government.The government requested that U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood be assigned to the case, because she is already presiding over the case in which Drexel is expected to plead guilty to six charges.The $1.85-billion total that the three are being asked to forfeit was based in part on calculations of how much each of them had received from Drexel.The indictment conspicuously leaves out a number of names of Drexel employees who reportedly have been under investigation.Arthur L. Liman, one of Milken's main defense lawyers, said in a written statement that Milken "will plead not guilty with confidence that in a fair trial he will be acquitted."He added that "I have been thrown into this indictment because of a fact in which I take great pride -- I am Michael Milken's brother."
