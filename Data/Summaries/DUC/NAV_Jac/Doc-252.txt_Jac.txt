A signal that relations between Yugoslavia and Slovenia might be reconsidered came this time from the Slovene capital.In the focus of Serbian attention now are relations with Croatia, and as far as Slovenia is concerned, the official proposal for the normalization of relations has to be specified first.We are, of course, interested in normal relations between Slovenia and Yugoslavia, but some prerequisites have to be fulfilled," Jovanovic concluded his statement.Yugoslav sources claim that Slovenia is becoming increasingly isolated because of its extreme policy toward Yugoslavia, so that this might be one of the reasons why it has decided to "soften" its attitudes toward Yugoslavia.In the view of Yugoslav diplomats, the normalization of relations between Slovenia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will certainly be a strenuous and long-term project.Slovenia is the former Yugoslav republic that made the greatest effort to harm the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.There are many situations that prove that Slovenia has a hostile attitude toward Yugoslavia.We are not bothered that Slovenia is an independent state.
