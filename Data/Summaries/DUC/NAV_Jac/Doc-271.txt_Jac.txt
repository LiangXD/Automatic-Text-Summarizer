During the meeting, the Shining Path Central Committee decided to continue the "people's war" and to consider those members who uphold the peace accord with the government to be removed from the party "by their own free will."The second point of the document of the Central Committee meeting presided over by "Feliciano" highlights the agreements of the Working Meeting of the Shining Path leadership held in August 1993, almost one year after Guzman was arrested, and during which the implementation of the agreements of the Third Plenum held in March 1992 was discussed.The following is one of the citations chosen by the Shining Path Central Committee to uphold its decisions: "Always taking into account the glorious actions of the people's war, the people's war cannot end.This was selected from the document entitled "To Conquer Power in the Midst of the People's War" that was drafted during the Second Shining Path Central Committee Plenum, when Guzman was still free.Meanwhile, the Central Committee has acknowledged "Gonzalo's Thoughts" as the ideological basis for the "people's war," Guzman Reinoso's "leadership" and his inability to lead the party and the war from prison, and has decided to reorganize the Shining Path machine to launch a new stage of the war without Guzman.In order to confront the Black Group or LOD, which are nothing but Shining Path militants who sign Abimael Guzman's letters and uphold his "great decision and definition" to negotiate with the government in order to end the war, the Central Committee demands that the militants "grow stronger on the Basis for Partisan Unity [Base de Unidad Partidaria, BUP]," which is the Shining Path basic principles adopted during the 1988 Congress, and "arrange for conquering power in the midst of the people's war."The Central Committee meeting that "Feliciano" presided over clearly defined its position toward Abimael Guzman Reinoso, whose ideological contribution to the people's war, called "Gonzalo's Thoughts," was acknowledged.The Dincote report, which confirmed that "Feliciano" presided over a Shining Path Central Committee meeting somewhere in Razuillca, added that it has been decided to "rescue Abimael Guzman Reinoso, dead or alive."A Shining Path pamphlet dated February, which is signed by the leaders under arrest, asserts that "the people's war has ended, and (therefore) to continue refusing to uphold (the "great decision and definition") means obstructing the Peace Accord and placing the life of President Gonzalo and other comrades at stake."This clearly means that the negotiators of the peace agreement no longer belong to the Shining Path because their actions openly violate the agreements, resolutions, and decisions reached at party meetings such as the Third Plenum and the Working Meeting.This communique "warned against" and "denounced" the reports of "Feliciano's" Central Committee, which decided to go on with the war.2. Abimael Guzman's letters to President Alberto Fujimori, the telephone conversation between Guzman and Javier Esparza Marquez (Guzman's brother-in-law, who is in charge of Shining Path's organization abroad), and the communiques released by Shining Path prisoners "are a counterrevolutionary scheme concocted by Yankee imperialists and the genocidal and traitorous dictatorship with the sinister help of the Black Group," the Central Committee concluded at its February meeting.But the Central Committee meeting in February disqualified the arrested leaders, stating that "it is an international communist rule that no leader can lead (the party or a war) from prison."Based on the conclusions of the Third Plenum and the Working Meeting, the Central Committee, during the meeting in February presided over by "Feliciano," reasserted "the principle of revolutionary violence as a universal law expressed in the people's war."The leadership may be wiped out completely or partially, but those leaders who are not must and can continue carrying out plans, the struggle, the people's war.
