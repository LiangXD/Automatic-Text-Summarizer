Two hundred years ago in Philadelphia, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention considered a proposal to join executive and judicial authority in a "council of revision" - a body that would have authority to reject and reshape laws enacted by the legislature.This "bottom-line" mentality is why Judge Bork's nomination is at risk even though Judge Bork recognizes that constitutional interpretation must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing times.Law making -- policy making -- by judges has become so pervasive that, of late, many see it as the judicial function against which potential judges must be measured.Currently on the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., Judge Bork is recognized as perhaps this country's most distinguished judicial scholar.Judge Bork's elevation to the Supreme Court may very well tip the balance toward this neutrality of interpretation, and there are those who fear that the court -- no longer able to do what the individual justices may think is "good" or "moral" or "right" -- will reject activist social, economic and criminal-justice agendas.Far from being ideologically partisan, as some have charged, Judge Bork holds fast to a neutral-principled approach irrespective of whose ox is being gored: "The sin of wanting judges to do good things simply because the electorate won't do them," he explained in the same interview, "is not confined to liberalism.Commenting on Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, Geoffrey Stone, dean of the University of Chicago Law School, called it "a four-star appointment" and commented that it was rare "to get anyone with anywhere near his credentials."In many respects, the judiciary has become the "master" branch of government because we have permitted judges' personal views to supplant the rule of established law.More than 150 years earlier, Francis Bacon had warned judges to remember that "their office is jus dicere, and not jus dare; to interpret law, and not to make law, or give law."
