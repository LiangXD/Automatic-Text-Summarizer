"Antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the United States, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international level," said Manheim."We are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to Antarctica, we just think tourism is something that has to be regulated carefully," he said."A year after Antarctica's most significant environmental disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar catastrophes," said Manheim.U.S. tour operators are planning to send a record 4,000 or more travelers to Antarctica, prompting calls for strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife and the very fate of the frozen continent.Military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists have been frequent modes of travel to Antarctica since the first tourists visited in 1958."The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than tripled in the past five years," said Bruce Manheim, a Washington activist of the Environmental Defense Fund who calls existing controls inadequate.
