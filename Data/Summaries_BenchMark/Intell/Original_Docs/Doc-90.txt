    US OPTIONS FOCUS/Indexes slow , more declines seen .
	

    CHICAGO 1997-03-31
	

    Turnover remained relatively slow in major U.S. stock index options despite the continued slide , traders said Monday .
	

    One trader in Chicago said the low volume indicated the selloff may not be over .
	

    "_ What I see is low volume and when you have low volume in a dropping market , that_ 's not good because you do_ n't get the climax , _" he said . "_ Looking at it today , this is not the climax becaue the volume is very low . _"
	

    By late trading , the bellwether Dow industrial average was down 111 points , or 1.65 percent , at about 6,630 .
	

    The Dow slumped 140 points last Thursday .
	

    Among broader indices , the S&P 100 .
	

    OEX was off about 10 points at 744 and the S&P 500 .
	

    SPX lost 10.5 points to 763 .
	

    A string of economic reports , including the key jobs report , which is scheduled for release Friday , was one factor keeping investors sidelined , but traders said last week's selloff also was a factor .
	

    "_ As far as buying , there has_ n't been a lot , _" the trader in Chicago said . "_ Everyone is just holding their breath .
	

    "_ Nobody is paying up for the puts _" where premiums remained rich , he said , adding that some investors were buying puts , expecting a bounce .
	

    One broker in Chicago said some investors were attempting to play the OEX options , but wide spreads and stiff premiums made them difficult to trade .
	

    He agreed activity was quiet .
	

    "_ The market goes down and nobody wants to do anything , _" he said . "_ If we get some kind of a reversal , I_ 'm sure we_ 'll get some action . _"
	

    Some analysts continued to look for some quarter-ending portfolio buying to emerge and support the market , but others noted that investor complacency appeared to be high , which is a bearish sign in a declining market .
	

    Jerry Hegarty , an analyst at Thomson Financial Services , said in a report that by afternoon , OEX put buying topped call buying by only 6,000 contracts despite the market's drop .
	

    By 1400 CST/2000 GMT , OEX call volume at the Chicago Board Options Exchange was 101,014 compared to put volume of 70,309 .
	

    Hegarty said first-of-the-month buying may help the market recover Tuesday and Wednesday .
	

    Although options trading indicated investor complacency , some indicators suggested bearishness was on the rise , which is bullish for contrarians .
	

    Joseph Sunderman , an analyst at Investment Research Institute in Cincinnati , said in a report that investor sentiment has turned "_ decisively _" bearish on stocks .
	

    He cited three sentiment indicators that all showed a notable drop in bullishness recently .
	

    "_ We believe that these_kind_of psychological reaction are healthy amid a long term market uptrend , _" Sunderman said in the report .
