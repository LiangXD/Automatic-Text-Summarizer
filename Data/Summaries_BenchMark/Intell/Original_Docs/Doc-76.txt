    Fund analysts point to recent sharp declines in technology shares and tech stock indices after momentum investors drove up prices to high levels .
	

    "_ There are a_lot_of momentum players who have driven prices beyond where they should have been , _" said Sheldon Jacobs , publisher of No Load Fund Investor .
	

    The Investment Company Institute , the mutual fund trade group , said net new cash flowing into the aggressive growth sector fell to $802.6 million in February from about $5 billion in January and $4.76 billion in February 1996 .

    Burt Berry , president of DAL Investment Co , which tracks funds , said other big losers for the month through March 24 include American Century Vista , off 13.8 percent ; Dreyfus Aggressive Growth , down 11.6 percent ; IAI Emerging Growth , off 14.5 percent ; and Fidelity Select Computer , off 14 percent .
	

    "_ When you go for the high flyers , when they hit the ground , the parachutes do_ n't open until impact , _" said Berry .
	

    Strategists traced the decline in growth stock prices to investor concern about the economy .
	

    "_ What you_ 're seeing here is a continued flight to quality , and a concern about the economy , _" said Jim Weiss , deputy chief investment officer for equities at State Street Research .
	

    "_ People are asking , '_ How much of the air is going to come out_of the balloon on economic growth ?
	

    What negative impact does that have on profit growth ? _' _"
	

    Investors are wondering to what degree earnings will be reduced as growth companies face higher costs but choose to delay price increases .
	

    Charles Biderman , president of Mutual Fund Trim Tabs , said the most recent cash flow trend indicates people are shifting from aggressive growth funds into growth and income or index funds .
	

    "_ If technology stocks and the Nasdaq index are doing poorly , people do_ n't want to put money into ( the funds ) , _" said Biderman .
	

    The Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen from 1378 on February 23 to about 1250 last Thursday .
	

    The Russell 2000 index fell to 349 last Thursday from about 370 on February 10 .
	

    Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical , said the decline in new cash reflects "_ an easy come , easy go ( attitude ) .
	

    _"
	

    "_ These funds tend to attract hot money , _" he said .
	

    Many of these fund are sold through financial advisers , who often encourage individual investors to time their fund purchases and sales like stocks , he added .
	

    According_to Lipper , the Berger fund's top pick in February was Brightpoint Inc , which has gone to 17-1/4 from 23 in the last month .
	

    The Pimco fund's top pick , Comverse Technology Inc , is off to 39-5/8 from 46 .
	

    The Perkin fund's top pick , ATS Medical Inc , has gone from 8-1/2 to 6-7/8 , and the Van Kampen fund's top holding was Intel Corp , which has fallen from 164 to 139-3/4 .
	

    The top PBHG fund holding was Oxford Health Plan Inc , which has dropped to 60 from nearly 66 earlier this month .
	

    "_ I think the sector is going to recover , but I_ 'm not sure the average person should wait around for it to recover , _" Jacobs said . "_ There_ 's been tremendous volatility and that can continue for a while . _"
