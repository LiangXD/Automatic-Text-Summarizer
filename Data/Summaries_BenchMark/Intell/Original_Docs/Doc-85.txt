    With the increasing likelihood the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again by early July , U.S. Treasury market participants said that the bill sector should benefit from rising coupon yields and a big drop in stock prices .

    Bills $-- primarily three $- and six-month $-- have outperformed the rest of the yield curve since last Tuesday's quarter-point rate hike by the Fed .
	

    While two-year note yields have jumped to 6.44 percent from 6.26 percent and bond yields rose to 7.08 percent from 6.92 percent , the three-month bill rate was down to 5.17 percent Monday morning from 5.25 percent .
	

    The six-month bill rate was at 5.31 percent , down about five basis points from early last week .
	

    Players said the sector is highly expensive , but between quarter-end pressures and the Fed seemingly embarking on a tightening cycle , it is logical for bills to do well .
	

    "_ This is a preservation-of-capital period , _" said Craig Coats , co-head of taxable fixed income at Prudential Securities Inc , noting players will continue to park money in safe-haven areas such as bills and repos for the time being .
	

    "_ People will stay short until the Fed is at the end of its ( tightening ) program , _" he said . "_ They_ 'll buy the short end to be defensive . _"
	

    Helping drive rates down , traders said , is the smaller pool of bills offered .

    For_example , at Monday afternoon's weekly auction , Treasury sold only $14 billion three $- and six-month bills $-- way down from $23 billion in the prior few auctions .
	

    Mostly , though , the strong performance in the front end was attributed to quarter end "_ window dressing _" and the fear of a string of rate hikes this year .
	

    Also , "_ because of what is going on in other markets we could hold these levels and do better , _" said a bill trader at a primary dealership , referring to U.S. stocks . "_ We are seeing flight-to-quality . _"
	

    After falling 140 points Thursday , the Dow Jones industrial average was down another 80 points Monday afternoon .
	

    Some of the money in stocks was shifted to bills , traders said , although a major allocation out_of stocks is not expected .
	

    "_ Unless you see stocks down 1,000 points , you wo_ n't see a meaningful shift , _" said Mark Mahoney , Treasury market strategist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
	

    Mahoney said that weaker stock prices aside , there are enough reasons the front end should do well in the near term .
	

    "_ The front end holds more value , _" he said . "_ So , we should see the front end outperform the back end for the next month . _"
	

    As such , Mahoney forecasts a steepening of the overall yield curve , perhaps as much as 10 basis points .
	

    The two-year to 30-year curve steepened a_bit on Monday , with the spread widening out to 66 basis points from 64 late Thursday .
	

    Traders noted that the near term directon of the curve and whether bills can hold at what is perceived to be 10 basis points too expensive lies with Friday's March employment report .
	

    "_ If we get a weaker jobs report and people say the Fed will ( skip ) the next tightening ( in May ) , we may see bills start to loosen up , _" said a trader at a Japanese-based dealer .
