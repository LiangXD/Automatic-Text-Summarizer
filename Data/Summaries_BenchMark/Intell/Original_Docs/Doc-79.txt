    U.S. Crude Outlook $- prices entrenched in weakness .
	

    NEW YORK 1997-03-31
	

    U.S. crude oil prices are likely to remain entrenched in a weak range this week amid ample physical supplies , but analysts say the upcoming "_ driving season _" could begin to mop up some of the excess .
	

    Analysts are keeping watch on today's expiry of the April contracts for refined products , especially for gasoline , to set the tone for the oil complex this week .
	

    "_ Much hinges on how gasoline progresses , _" said John Saucer , an analyst with Smith Barney in Houston .
	

    "_ At this point , it_ 's still struggling relative to the rest of the complex . _"
	

    Tom Bentz of ING Derivatives in New York seconded that view . "_ Gasoline still has_ n't exhibited a_lot_of strength .
	

    There does_ n't seem to be a_lot_of fear about gasoline , _" he said .
	

    NYMEX gasoline for April was trading around 64.30 cents a gallon in New York Harbor early Monday afternoon , down 0.33 cents from Thursday's settlement .
	

    Still , Saucer pointed out that refinery runs are beginning to pick up in anticipation of the summer driving season .
	

    "_ The crude market wo_ n't be as sloppy as it has been _" in the weeks ahead , he said .
	

    Market activity was subdued on Monday after the long Easter weekend .
	

    London's International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) is closed today to observe Easter Monday , and some state-side traders have not yet returned to their offices .
	

    May West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was trading around $20.70-80 a barrel at midday , up about five cents from late Thursday's cash market .
	

    Sweet domestic cash grade differentials were talked slightly weaker , reflecting the resolution of last week's hostage crisis at Royal Dutch/Shell's operations in the Niger Delta .
	

    The disturbances shut down some 210,000 barrel per day ( bpd ) of Nigerian production from top equity producer Royal Dutch/Shell's operations , or about 10 percent of the country's total flows .
	

    Shell said Monday it was restarting oil output at all affected locations following the restoration of peace in the region , though Nigerian production remained some 160,000 bpd below normal .
	

    U.S. sour cash crudes were steady although traders expect these grades to lose steam in the weeks ahead .
	

    "_ If there_ 's one thing we_ 've got plenty_of it_ 's sour , _" said a Texas broker . "_ I still think we could be below below $3.00 ( discount to WTI/Cushing ) .
	

    _"
	

    West Texas Sour/Midland was trading around WTI/Cushing minus $2.40 a barrel late Monday morning .
	

    Abundant foreign crudes continue to pressure the U.S. domestic crude market .
	

    Swiss-based trader Glencore has chartered a ULCC for North Sea Brent which could arrive on the Gulf Coast at the end of April , although it_ 's still possible that the trading house could head to South Africa instead .
	

    The May spread between WTI and Brent was around $1.35-40 a barrel on Monday , a level that would ordinarily discourage transatlantic trade except_for the continued weakness of dated Brent .
	

    Dated Brent stood around May Brent minus 85 cents a barrel on Monday .
	

    Nigerian crude as_well_as short-haul barrels from Latin America are also plentiful , giving Gulf Coast refiners a wide range of crudes to choose from as they gear up_to produce more gasoline .
	

    One trader pointed out , however , that improved refining margins are transforming the current crude surplus into a product surplus , a concept that could be borne out in this week's inventory statistics .
