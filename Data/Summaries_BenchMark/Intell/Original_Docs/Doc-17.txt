TENNIS-HINGIS RULES THE TENNIS WORLD .

She_ 's fresh-faced and formidable and now rules the world of women's tennis .
At age 16 , Martina Hingis of Switzerland has swept aside her last 26 opponents on the fast track to becoming the youngest player ever to grab the top ranking in the world .
The latest player to fall to the Hingis combination of speed and tennis smarts was Monica Seles in the final of the Lipton Championships .
The execution was swift , as Hingis needed only 44 minutes in a 6-2 6-1 romp .
"_ It_ 's just like a_little dream comes true right_now , _" said Hingis , who officially took over as queen of tennis when new rankings were released on Monday .
"_ All the life you work for it and it_ 's getting true , you_ 're becoming the best player in the world . _"
Being the best can be an arduous job , but Hingis for now seems immune to the pressures the number one spot can bring .
"_ I_ 've never had so much fun out_there , _" says Hingis , who became the youngest player to win a Grand Slam title when she won the Australian Open in January .
"_ If you play well , you know you can beat almost everybody in the world .
It_ 's great to go out_there and play in front of 10,000 people . _"
Even the absence from the Lipton Championships of Steffi Graf , who lost her top ranking to the charging Hingis , was of no great concern to the Czech-born Swiss sensation .
"_ It does_ n't matter to me if she ca_ n't play , compete at this tournament , _" Hingis says of Graf . "_ It_ 's not my problem .
She has to be prepared and try to play at these tournaments .
If she_ 's not able to , somebody_else is going to step there . _"
Hingis takes time from the rigours of competition to blow off steam .
An avid horsewoman , Hingis travels with "_ my boots and pants _" in hopes of a joyous ride .
Rollerblades also fit into the suitcase and residents on Key Biscayne have stopped and stared as the Swiss miss skates by .
"_ I ca_ n't be all_the_time here at the courts , _" Hingis said . "_ It would just get crazy if you would spend all_the_time on the site .
For me , it_ 's important to do something_else . _"
The trip to the top has been a wonderful ride .
Surprisingly mature for her age , Hingis never appears intimidated by opponents or anything_else .
Nor does she anticipate feeling fearful of weighty expectations .
"_ What should I be afraid of ? _" said Hingis , tossing a questioning look . "_ Why should I be worried ?
Everything is perfect . _"
Hingis even turns a nonchalant eye to the vast amounts of money she_ 's amassed .
This year alone , she_ 's earned over $1 million .
"_ The money is rolling , rolling , _" laughs Hingis . "_ Well , life does_ n't change because you just won $100,000 more_or_less .
I still ca_ n't drive a car .
I still ca_ n't go out , I still ca_ n't do that because I_ 'm underage everywhere . _"
Everywhere , that is , except in the world of tennis .
