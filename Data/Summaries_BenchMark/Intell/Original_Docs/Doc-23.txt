CRICKET-INDIA SET FOR VICTORY AFTER WEST INDIES CRASH .BRIDGETOWN , Barbados 1997-03-30
	

     India were poised to claim only their third win in 31 tests in the Caribbean after their seam bowlers routed the West Indies batsmen during the third day of the third test on Sunday .
	
     The West Indies were bowled out for a meagre 140 in their second innings , their lowest score ever against India , to leave the tourists needing 120 to win in their second innings with two full days left .
	
At the close , India , who earlier in the day were bowled out in their first innings for 319 in reply to West Indies'first innings 298 , were two without loss .
	
     Navjot Sidhu was not out two and Vangipurrapu Laxman was still to get off the mark .
	
     Abey Kuruvilla , a tall , gangling fast bowler in only his third test , was India's hero with career-best figures of five for 68 off 21 overs .
	

     Kuruvilla was given admirable support from Venkatesh Prasad , whose three for 39 off 18 overs gave him match figures of eight for 121 , the best match haul by an Indian in six tests at the Kensington Oval .
	
     Dodda Ganesh chipped in with two for 28 off six overs as only stand-in West Indies captain Brian Lara , with 45 , made more than 25 runs .
	
     The West Indies' total , eleven runs short_of the 151 they managed at Madras during the 1978-79 series , would have been even lower but_for a last wicket stand of 33 runs between fast bowlers Mervyn Dillon ( 21 ) and Curtly Ambrose ( 18 not out ) .
	

     Earlier in the day the West Indies had done well in reducing India from 249 for three overnight to 319 all out , capturing the last four wickets for 29 runs and restricting India's first innings lead to 21 runs .
	
 India lost the wickets of Saurav Ganguly ( 22 ) , Rahul Dravid ( 78 ) and Nayan Mongia ( one ) in the first session for the addition of only 41 runs as the West Indies bowlers dominated .
Dravid , who was bowled by fast bowler Ian Bishop , batted for six hours and 12 minutes , faced 243 balls and struck eight fours .
     In the third over after lunch , former captain Mohammad Azharuddin , who struggled for two hours in scoring 17 , was caught by wicketkeeper Courtney Browne off fast bowler Franklyn Rose .
     In the next over , Curtly Ambrose bowled Kuruvilla for nought to leave India on 296 for eight .
     Rose wrapped_up the innings to end with 4-77 as the home team appeared to be back in with a shout .
	
     In fact , the West Indies' problems were just begining .
     They quickly lost opener Stuart Williams ( 0 ) and first innings century-maker Shivnarine Chanderpaul ( 3 ) in reaching on 31 for two at tea .
     After the break , the wickets of Sherwin Campbell ( 18 ) , Carl Hooper ( 4 ) , Lara , Courtney Browne ( 1 ) , Roland Holder ( 13 ) and Bishop ( 6 ) tumbled in quick succession as the West Indies collapsed to 95 for eight .
Prasad captured the key wicket of Lara , who after facing 67 balls in 104 minutes , edged an outswinger to Azharuddin at second slip .
