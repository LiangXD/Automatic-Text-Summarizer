NCAA BASKETBALL-SATURDAY NIGHT'S CASUALTIES FINE FOR MONDAY TITLE GAME .

There were casualties in Saturday night's NCAA semifinal battles but the victors said Sunday that everybody would be ready for Monday's national championship game .
Kentucky's NBA-bound shooting star Ron Mercer had cramps in both calves and a tightening hamstring that cut into both his playing time and jumping ability .
He shot just 7-for-21 but still scored a team-high 19 points in the win over Minnesota .
"_ Right now , I_ 'm fine , _" Mercer told reporters Sunday . "_ Come Monday I do_ n't think we_ 'll have time to feel tired .
We have one more game left for the national championship and I do_ n't think anybody is going to feel tired because we know we have to go out and do it . _"
"_ Ron's been playing a_lot_of minutes , _" Kentucky coach Rick Pitino said , _" and people have been hitting him , banging him , and he was physically a_little whipped last night . _"
Mercer needed several leg massages on the sidelines and still played 34 of the 40 minutes Saturday , so his coach was letting him rest up Sunday .
But come game day , there would be no mercy .
"_ Because of all those cramps he got the option to rest , and he should come out really fired up tomorrow , because he rested yesterday , _" Pitino said with a smile .
Arizona's useful backup guard Jason Terry played only 20 minutes , his lowest total of the season , and was taken to a hospital for tests and intravenous treatment after he fell during the Wildcats' upset of North Carolina .
"_ We were going to put him in late in the game , _" said Arizona coach Lute Olson . "_ He had played a lot before that , of_course , but when we_ 're protecting a lead , we like getting four perimeter guys in_there and that gives us another ( ball ) handler , gives us another free throw shooter .
"_ And I called for him to come and Ed Orr , our trainer , said Coach , he ca_ n't go .
He was feeling very faint and just very , very ill at that point .
"_ After the game , he was checked .
He was dehydrated .
	
He was taken to the hospital .
 He was put on IVs to take care of the dehydration .
"_ He_ 's back , he had breakfast with the guys this morning , I understand $....
Our trainer said he looked good .
     Olson added : "_ He did leave a deposit in the ambulance on the way to the hospital , so he was a sick puppy last night .
   But I think he_ 's fine today . _"
    Kentucky's quiet young point guard Wayne Turner said : "_ Physically there was a_lot_of bumping and banging .
   I was hoping to have some bumps and bruises .
   If I left the game without bumps and feeling really tired , I would have cheated my team . _"
  Pitino predicted that Monday's championship game would be more of the same , in view of Kentucky's all-out pressure defence and Arizona's blazing speed : "_ I think the team standing at the end is going to win this .
 I think they_ 're going to have to give a_lot_of their bodies to win this game . _"
