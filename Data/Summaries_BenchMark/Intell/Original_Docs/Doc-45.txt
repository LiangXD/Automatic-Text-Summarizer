    Indocement 1996 net seen above target .
	

    JAKARTA 1997-03-31
	

    Net profits posted by Indocement , a major Indonesian cement manufacturer , in 1996 are above market estimates and installation of additional production capacity in 1997 and 1998 should keep the company in good stead , analysts said .
	

    PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa announced it booked a net profit of 551.49 billion rupiah in 1996 .
	

    Analysts said the market consensus for the figure was 549.4 billion rupiah .
	

    "_ The ( net profit ) result of Indocement for 1996 is slightly above our expectations of about 523 billion rupiah , _" Stephanus Partono , an analyst at Goldman Sachs in Singapore , told Reuters .
	

    However , Partono said the company had instituted changes in its accounting system in 1996 which partially accounted for the above-expectation earnings .
	

    Aside_from changes in the accounting method , he also said the stable growth of the company's food division at about 15 percent per year had contributed to earnings growth .
	

    Partono said he expected Indocement's cement division to imrove its performance in 1997 and 1998 due_to additional capacity from two new plants in West Java and Kalimantan .
	

    Company officials were not available for comment .
	

    Partono said Indofood's new West Java plant , with an annual capacity of 1.3 million tonnes , would start operations in April while the one in Kalimantan , with an annual capacity of 2.4 million tonnes , would start operations in August 1998 .
	

    "_ Growth of its cement division in 1996 was not too exciting as volume growth and price increases were relatively small .
	

    But in 1997 and 1998 , its cement division should pick up due_to additional capacity , _" Partono said .
	

    However , Partono said he expected Indocement to perform only in line with the broader market and not exceed it .
	

    "_ If we break up the value of Indocement into two divisions , cement and food , the cement business is undervalued , _" he said .
	

    He added that currently it trades at a price earnings of 9.1 times its 1997 earnings compared with Semen Gresik which trades at 12 times 1997 earnings .
	

    "_ So , its cement business appears to be undervalued relative to other cement companies .
	

    But investors prefer to hold Gresik and Cibinong because they are pure cement plays , _" he said .
	

    Partono said it was hard to make a fair valuation for Indocement because it could not be considered a pure cement stock or a pure food stock .
	

    The Jakarta bourse was closed on Monday because it was the last day of the 1996/97 fiscal year and will reopen on Tuesday .
