    A highly polished , 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E , the same model used by Earhart in 1937 , carried Finch and navigator Bob Fodge into a cloudy Miami sky enroute to Puerto Rico .

    Hundreds of spectators waved and cheered as Finch , dressed in a beige flight suit , climbed into the cockpit of the Electra and revved the engines .
	

    The plane , one of only two remaining , was painstakingly restored for "_ World Flight 1997 , _" a $4.5-million project to visit five continents and 20 countries on a 30,000-mile ( 48,000 km ) route similar to that taken by Earhart .
	

    "_ We_ 're finally ready to leave .
	

    We_ 've been getting ready for years .
	

    To finally leave the U.S. is great , _" said Finch shortly before takeoff from suburban Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport .
	

    The Miami airfield from which Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan left no_longer exists .
	

    Trailed by a blue Grumman amphibious plane that will act as her safety net , Finch left Miami after a week of meetings with schoolchildren , preparations on the Electra and a_bit_of fishing , as Earhart is said to have done six decades ago .
	

    Finch , who early on Monday helped stow luggage aboard the plane and joined a horde of helpers to push it from a hangar , said she had been consumed with final flight details .
	

    "_ I think Amelia was probably the same way .
	

    You really get focused on the details of making the flight and the plane and what it needs as you_ 're flying , _" Finch said .
	

    "_ I think Amelia's journey was much harder without fax machines and telephones to arrange for fuel and oil and landing permits , _" she said . "_ It must have been difficult . _"
	

    Finch's aides say the pilot is reluctant to compare her flight to Earhart's , believing the message of the pioneering aviator's cause was lost in the mystery of her disappearance .
	

    Earhart , the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic , completed 22,000 miles ( 35,400 km ) of her journey and vanished in July 1937 on the leg from New Guinea to Howland Island .
	

    Finch , who left Oakland , California , on March 17 and expects to return there in late May , posed for pictures , signed autographs and shook hands with hundreds of spectators who turned out to bid her farewell .
	

    Jane Logman of the Netherlands , the wife of a pilot , said Finch was a role model to her 15-year-old daughter , who had just begun pilot training .
	

    "_ I would like my daughter to do the same ( as Finch ) , _" Logman said . "_ She_ 's an inspiration and especially because she_ 's a woman . _"
	

    World Flight is sponsored by Pratt & Whitney , a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp , which distributed a free educational program to schools throughout the United States .
	

    Bob Malott , a United Technologies director , rode with Finch and Fodge on the Electra to Puerto Rico .
	

    The twin-propeller plane , its aluminum skin buffed to gleaming silver , was a wreck when it was hauled from the scrap heap in Wisconsin .
	

    It has been refurbished in minute detail $-- down to the brilliant orange paint on wings and tail meant to help rescuers find it in an emergency $-- with a_few modern gizmos added for safety .
	

    "_ Amelia had the most modern stuff at the time , and so do we , _" navigator Fodge said .
	

    The education program was designed to teach students about Earhart and to spur interest in science , math and geography .
	

    "_ What Amelia did is to try and set a new world record , _" Finch said . "_ But what we_ 're doing is to communicate a message , that you do not have to live within defined limits that society sets or that many people set for themselves . _"
	

    Some children in the crowd , many of whose parents had not been born when Earhart died , seemed well-informed about Earhart's journey , calling her a "_ hero _" and an "_ inspiration . _" But Matt Bodenhamer , 8 , of Miami , expressed doubts about Finch's re-creation .
	

    "_ I think it_ 's crazy .
	

    She might to the same thing as Amelia .
	

    She might crash and die , _" he said .
