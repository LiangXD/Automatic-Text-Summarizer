    CHICAGO 1997-03-31
	

    U.S. June Standard and Poor's 500 futures closed at the lowest price since January 10 , extending Thursday's collapse .
	

    The slide from Thursday's high to Monday's low totaled 43.60 points .
	

    Trade was choppy and sluggish most of the day with players wary after big losses Thursday and ahead_of key data later this week .
	

    Once T-bond futures closed , downside momentum built .
	

    "_ The traders are fearing Friday's employment number and they take any chance they get to hit this thing on rallies , _" one S&P 500 futures trader said . "_ They_ 're waiting in the wings to whack them . _"
	

    The March National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) index of manufacturing activity will be released Tuesday and March non-farm payrolls on Friday .
	

    NAPM was forecast at 53.6 from 53.1 in February , with payrolls seen up 182,000 against a 339,000 February gain .
	

    One S&P 500 futures trader pegged support for Tuesday at 757.00 , then 753.00 $-- "_ if at all . _"
	

    "_ It is serious technical damage that will take time to repair , _" said Greg Nie , technical analyst with Everen Securities .
	

    But he said volume may have to pick up before too much more damage is done .
	

    A floor trader agreed .
	

    "_ It was_ n't a total disaster , _" he said , adding that dealers who were buyers on earlier dips scrambled to get out on the later downdraft , accentuating losses .
	

    The Chicago Mercantile Exchange estimated overall S&P 500 volume on Monday at 87,268 contracts , up from 71,994 contracts traded on Thursday .
	

    Nie pegged June S&P support in the upper 750.00 handle to near 760.00 .
	

    June closed down 17.50 at 758.00 .
	

    June eroded through key support early in the session , which helped turn the tone sour later , traders said .
	

    The double bottom low from Thursday and from January 13 at 768.50 was easily pierced , triggering waves of sell stops below there .
	

    June showed some resilience at midday and sliced its losses , but was unable to hold the gains .
	

    "_ There was very late but very obvious selling pressure for the end of the quarter $-- a quick dose of undressing , _" Nie noted .
	

    At the close , June Midcap 400s were down 7.30 pts at 252.10 , Nikkei 225 index futures fell 330.0 to 17,790.0 , Nasdaq 100s lost 22.75 pts to 804.00 and KCBT Value Line futures fell 19.20 to 677.30 .
