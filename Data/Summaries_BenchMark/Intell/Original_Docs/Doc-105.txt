Teen Who Sold White iPhone Kits Reveals How Apple Hunted Him Down

One of the last followers of tech news to hear the reports Thursday that Apple had sued Fei Lam, the 17-year-old Queens high school student who infamously sold White iPhone conversion kits to eager buyers tired of waiting on Apple's release, was Fei Lam. How did Lam hear about it? "I came back from school today and saw your email," he tells Fast Company via chat message, adding, "Lol."

For someone who allegedly made contacts in China to import iPhone parts before Apple, started his own business (WhiteiPhone4Now.com), and pulled in tens of thousands of dollars in revenue--sometimes as much as $8,000 a day--it's easy to forget that Lam is just a teenage boy still living with his parents. But after Apple caught wind of his success, Lam's no longer just dealing with gym class and puberty like most kids his age--before long, he had a private investigator after him. And yesterday, it surfaced that Apple had sicced its legal pitbulls on the teen, filing a lawsuit against Lam over trademark infringement that would force him to cease from future sales and forfeit all profits from the venture. Apple also filed a request for dismissal simultaneously, suggesting the company might have found a settlement with Lam.

We caught up with Lam via IM on Thursday. He's a bit shy about the whole situation, as you'd expect, but as he tells it, the lawsuit is far from settled.
