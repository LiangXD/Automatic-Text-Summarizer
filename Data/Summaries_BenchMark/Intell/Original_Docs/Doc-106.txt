Google Proposes Android Revenue for Oracle: Filing

Google is willing to pay Oracle a percentage of Android revenue on two patents if Oracle succeeds in proving patent infringement at an upcoming trial over the Java programming language, according to a court filing.

Oracle said, however, that the proposed damages from Google are too low, according to the document, which the two companies filed jointly.

Oracle sued Google in 2010, claiming the Internet search leader's Android mobile operating technology infringed Oracle's Java patents. A trial is set for April 16 before U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco.

Oracle also sued for alleged copyright infringement. Oracle has contended that Google should pay hundreds of millions of dollars on that claim, which is separate from the two patents.

In the Tuesday court filing, Google proposed paying Oracle roughly $2.8 million in damages on two patents, covering the period through 2011.

For future damages, Google proposed paying Oracle 0.5 percent of Android revenue on one patent until it expires this December and 0.015 percent on a second patent until it expires in April 2018.

Oracle acquired Java through its purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010. Earlier this month, Oracle agreed to withdraw several claims after some of its patents were struck down by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
