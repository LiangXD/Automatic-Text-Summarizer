    A man walks through a crowd .
	

    He looks entirely ordinary .
	

    A heartbeat quickens and gets louder .
	

    The cross-hairs of a telescopic sight zero in on him .
	

    "_ The choice is yours , _" a voice rumbles .
	

    "_ File your return . _"
	

    There was no mistaking the message of the advertisement on Russian television on Monday .

    The taxman has you in his sights .
	

    It was the latest in an intimidating series of spots as the March 31 deadline arrived for Russians to file 1996 tax returns .
     Link: [Comments: s1 explains "The campaign"]
	

    The campaign also has hair-raising footage of the heavily armed Tax Police in action $-- Kalashnikovs and tear gas grenades are in this year , brown suits and briefcases are out .

    It seems to have worked , as more people filed returns .
     Link: [Comments: there is a link between these two sentences,, signalled by "But" at the start of the 2nd sentence - this sentence can't really stand alone, as it needs to be compared with something else.]
	

    But all the evidence points to evasion on a grand scale , leaving the cash-hungry government with a headache that will not go away .
	

    "_ We_ 've had about twice as many returns as last year , _" said Lidia Grin , head of Tax Inspectorate No. 30 in western Moscow .
	

    "_ It_ 's been better organised this year .
	

    The media campaign has made people aware of their obligations , _" she said .
	

    National forecasts mirror that trend .
	

    The central tax office said it expected more than five and half million returns $-- about double the 2.8 million a year ago .

    That is good news for the government , which has made recovering taxes a priority after blaming persistent revenue shortfalls for the long delays in pensions and wages that sparked nationwide street protests last Thursday .
	

    Yet it is not very good news .
	

    It still means millions of Russians , the vast majority in fact , are dodging their taxes .
	

    True , many of the country's 100 million odd adults earn less than 12 million roubles ( $2,100 ) a year , above which they must file a return .
	

    Officially , the average wage is about $1,500 .
	

    But few Russians doubt nearly everyone fiddles the system .
     Comments: this sounds a bit odd, starting with "But", but it is important, and I don't think it is necessary to include lots of previous text (too much for a summary) just to account for this.
	

    "_ It_ 's nice to feel we are seeing results , _" Grin said . "_ But we still have a_lot_of work to do .
	

    We_ 've learned a lot from the Americans .
	

    But our system is only six years_old , not 60 .
	

    _"
	

    The size of her task is daunting .
	

    There are about 40,000 working people in her area , but she expects just 2,000 returns .
	

    And with just a dozen or so tax inspectors , the other 38,000 citizens have relatively little chance of being caught .
	

    So why bother ?
	

    The answers along lengthy lines on Monday were similar : a_little_bit of tax buys a_lot_of peace of mind .
	

    "_ I want to sleep at nights , _" said 59-year-old Alexander , a research scientist , filing a return for the first time .
	

    He was to pay 260,000 roubles ( $45 ) on a declared 1996 income of 19 million ( $3,330 ) .
	

    The last time he paid tax was in 1990 .
	

    "_ It saves time , _" said Arkady Ivanov , another scientist and first-time filer . "_ Doing it now means no_more hassle later . _"
	

    "_ If you can get away with not paying , good luck to you , _" said 34-year-old lawyer Alexander , who has several jobs . "_ If not you_ 're in trouble .
	

    It_ 's better to file a declaration . _"
	

    Few people anywhere like paying taxes .

    But there is a degree of bitterness and resistance in Russia that goes beyond that , due mostly to the perception that they get nothing in return .
	

    Public employees like teachers and doctors are still getting tax demands on salaries the state has failed to pay for months .
	

    "_ Taxes are a waste of money , _" Alexander said . "_ The country's falling apart and people in need get nothing .
	

    I_ 'd prefer to give them something directly .
	

    So , let_ 's say , I '_ minimise _' my taxes . _"
