    Heightened concern about the outlook for interest rates sent Wall Street stocks skidding for a second straight session on Monday and dragged the Dow industrials to one of their sharpest losses ever .
	

    The Dow industrials tumbled 157 points to 6583 .
	

    The slide , unofficially the sixth largest in history in point terms , came on the heels of a 140-point skid on Thursday .
	

    "_ There_ 's clearly nervousness out_there right_now , _" said Philip Orlando , chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management .
	

    "_ We_ 've got industries like technology that have just gotten hammered , with many companies losing half their value in just the last two months , _" he added .
	

    The declines by technology issues , coupled with weak showing by health-care stocks , pulled Nasdaq down 28 points to 1222 .
	

    Analysts said some of the activity bore the earmarks of portfolio window-dressing by managers leery of showing large stock holdings in the uncertain climate .
	

    "_ Today was the last day of the quarter , and it looked like we got some reverse window-dressing , _" said Peter Canelo , chief investment strategist at Dean Witter .
	

    "_ All of a sudden nobody wants to show they own any stocks , _" he said .
	

    But foremost among the market's problems remained mounting concern the Federal Reserve is likely to prescribe more of the interest rate medicine it started dispensing last week in an effort to quash inflation pressures in the economy .
     Comments: sentence starts with "But", and won't necessarily be adjacent to anything that matches this.
	

    Several important economic indicators are due this week , among them Friday's monthly payroll , wage and unemployment figures , as_well_as the Tuesday release of the National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) survey .
	

    Yields on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury edged up_to 7.10 percent ahead_of the NAPM report , extending an upward creep that has become a burden for stocks and has some questioning whether rates will level off anytime soon .
	

    "_ If ( the bond yield ) was a stock , we would buy it , _" said Gary Kaltbaum , technical analyst at J.W. Charles Securities . "_ We_ 're getting to levels on the yield that are_ n't even on the one-year chart . _"
	

    Financial stocks were pummelled amid the broad decline , including Dow components J.P. Morgan & Co Inc , off 4-1/2 to 98-1/4 , and Travelers Group Inc , down 2-7/8 to 48 .
	

    Analysts said brokerages were particularly hard hit among financials , another symptom of ailing market sentiment .
	

    "_ The brokerage index is extremely sensitive to market climates , _" said Joseph Barthel , chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co .
	

    He added that traditionally , brokerage stocks peak about six months before the onset of a bear market , but warned that trying to time such a peak is an act of futility .
	

    "_ You never know when the peak was until you look back , _" he said .
	

    The American Stock Exchange's Broker-Dealer index .
	

    XBD fell 26 points , or 4.6 percent , to 490.31 .
	

    Within the group , Salomon Inc dipped 2-5/8 to 49-7/8 , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc slipped 1-3/8 to 29-1/4 and A.G. Edwards Inc fell 3-5/8 to 30-3/4 .
	

    Among individual issues , Ascend Communications Inc staggered lower after announcing it would acquire Cascade Communications Corp in a $3.7 billion stock swap .
	

    Ascend shares tumbled 11-1/4 to 40-3/4 , while Casdade shares shed two points to 26-3/8 .
	

    Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp fell 3-7/8 to 33-5/8 , extending a slide that started on news of a federal probe of the company's operations in El Paso , Texas .
	

    Volume in Columbia/HCA , the NYSE's most active issue on the day , exceeded 13 million shares .
	

    Dynamics Corp of America jumped five to 38-1/8 after WHX Corp began a $40-per-share cash tender offer to increase its stake in Dynamics to 19.9 percent .
	

    WHX fell 1/4 to 6-3/4 .
	

    The S&P 500 fell 16.76 points to 757.12 .
	

    The Nasdaq Composite fell 27.81 to 1221.70 .
