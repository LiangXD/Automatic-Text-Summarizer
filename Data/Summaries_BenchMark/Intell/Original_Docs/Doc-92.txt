    U.S. debt futures finished mostly lower in quiet post-holiday trading , still spooked by Thursday's technical breakdown and wary ahead_of upcoming key data .
	

    The long end sagged late and U.S. June Treasury bond futures ended just above their session low .
	

    "_ The market's in bad shape , _" one T-bond futures trader said . "_ In fact , it was a pretty bad close considering where we were all day , _" he said .
	

    He estimated the high volume area for the day's session at 107-10/32 to 107-16/32 .

    Oversold ideas after Thursday's breakdown on technicals and rate-hike fears supported June T-bonds earlier in the session , traders said .
	

    "_ There may have been some bargain hunting going on all day with the market oversold , but those buyers could_ n't get enough of a bounce to stay long overnight , _" said Don Pullen , E.D. and F. Man's bond trading floor manager .
