    In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade , Coram shares were off 3.12 percent , or 1/8 , to 3-7/8 in above-average trading volume , while Integrated shares gained 0.9 percent , or 1/4 , to 29-1/4 .
	

    The companies said the share-exchange ratio in their five-month-old agreement was amended to 0.15 Integrated common shares for each Coram common share from 0.2111 shares .
	

    Integrated Health said Monday that based on the closing price of its stock on the last business day before execution of the new terms , it would be paying $4.35 per Coram share .
	

    When the merger was first announced last October , it said Coram holders would get about $5.50 worth of Integrated stock for each Coram share under the previous , fixed ratio .

    The deal then was worth $655 million , $280 million of that contained in the equity part of the transaction and the balance in the assumption of Coram debt and other financial obligations .
	

    A Coram spokesman said the new terms were negotiated in response to the "_ overall pressure on the IV ( intravenous ) therapy industry .
	

    Coram has been given more certainty of the merger closing by virtue of the $25 million breakup fee _" contained in the new terms that go into effect this Friday .
	

    Joel Ray , analyst at Wheat First Butcher Singer , said "_ The stated reason ( for the change in the terms ) is the weakness in the sector in general .
	

    It has caused a_little consternation on the part of IHS .
	

    They renegotiated the terms down about 30 percent on the stock side .
	

    The same amount of debt is being assumed . _"
	

    "_ We have been recommending Integrated Health , _" Ray said . "_ The transaction makes a_lot_of sense for the intermediate $- and long-run .
	

    I still like the deal . _"
	

    Coram also announced this morning a fourth quarter loss of $0.75 per share , or $31.6 million , including a $15.1 million provision for settlement of a shareholder lawsuit , versus a year-ago loss of $0.45 per share , or $17.6 million .
	

    Revenues for the three months ended December 31 fell to $126 million from $153.7 million , Coram said .
