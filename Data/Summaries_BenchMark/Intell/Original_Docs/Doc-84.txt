    Columbia/HCA lost 4-3/4 to 33 and was the heavily traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange .
	

    The stock has dropped sharply in the past two weeks as news of the federal probe of its El Paso operations surfaced .
	

    The stock closed at 44-1/8 on March 12 .
	

    "_ We_ 're not in a hurry to sell the stock .
	

    The stock is still good long-term .
	

    Anyone who is selling will probably regret it long-term , _" said Brian Eisenbarth , an analyst with Collins & Co .
	

    "_ The market is pricing in a_lot_of bad news that , on the surface , dosen't seem that big of a deal , _" Eisenbarth .
	

    Columbia/HCA , the nation's largest hospital company , said Monday it cooperated with federal agents who searched its El Paso , Texas , facilities .
	

    The probe covered a "_ broad range of records and documents _" and was completed by March 20 , the company said .
	

    "_ If regulators believed that the problems were systemic , they would have gone into many locations .
	

    So , the fact that they are only in one location leads one to think that it_ 's not a company-wide issue , _" Joseph Chiarelli , an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities . "_ What would make me uncomfortable is if the government went into other markets and locations at Columbia .
	

    Then I_ 'd be concerned , _" he said .
	

    Chiarelli said he continues to rate the stock as a buy .
	

    Investor concerns also have been fueled by a recent New York Times report concerning the Nashville , Tenn.-based company's Medicare coding practices and physician ownership in certain of its hospitals .

    Analysts cautioned that the New York Times used its own methodology , which has not been verified by others in the healthcare industry , as the basis of its article .
	

    Columbia/HCA said it was not given the opportunity to review the New York Times' data and could not address the newspaper's findings .
	

    Analysts expect Columbia/HCA's stock to continue to face near-term pressure but said the company will remain a market leader over the long-term .
	

    "_ The stock was in for a tough day today .
	

    The stock will rebound , but I expect continued negative commentary to pressure the stock for the near-term , _" John Hindelong , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
	

    "_ We still think Columbia is a giant $-- a market leader that is incredibly successful .
	

    You do_ n't get there on criminal or fraudulent activity , _" said de Rham .
