    OPTIONS $- FX vols climb despite lower dollar .
	

    CHICAGO 1997-03-31
	

    Implied volatilities for dollar-pair options crept higher on Monday despite the dollar's retreat into familiar territory , puzzling traders and suggesting to some that a more decisive move lies ahead .
	

    One-month dollar/yen and dollar/mark volatilities rose even as spot dollar backed further away from upper-end boundaries at 125 yen and 1.70 marks , analysts noted .
	

    "_ Everyone has been wondering what is behind this movement _" in volatility , said an options trader for a Japanese bank .
	

    The trader said the market appeared to be growing more convinced that a sharp move in the dollar is imminent .
	

    "_ Everyone agrees on one thing $-- it_ 's a matter of time $-- but views are mixed when it comes to a direction , _" he said .
	

    One-month dollar/yen volatility climbed to 10.30/10.55 percent , a gain of about 0.7 point from Thursday's close .
	

    One-week dollar/yen posted a sharp increase , jumping 1.5 point to 10.50/11.50 percent .
	

    One-month dollar/mark was quoted at 9.3/9.6 percent and one-week at 9.75/10.75 percent , also up substantially from levels late Thursday .
	

    The dollar was recently trading at 123.70 yen and 1.6745 marks .
	

    A U.S. investor's large purchase of 130-yen puts with a six-month timeframe helped pull the entire volatility curve higher this morning , traders said .
	

    Analysts said the steep rise in short-dated volatilities is not surprising given that the Bank of Japan releases its quarterly "_ Tankan _" survey of business sentiment Wednesday and that U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is scheduled to meet with Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and other senior government officials in Tokyo later this week .
	

    Many foreign exchange traders expect the Tankan report to set the next trend for the Japanese currency .
	

    The start of the new Japanese fiscal year on Tuesday also may be lending support .
	

    "_ Many people try to close short volatility positions before getting into a new fiscal year , _" said the trader for a Japanese bank .
	

    Analysts said the downturn in U.S. stocks was not yet affecting dollar volatility .
	

    "_ The wild card is the stock market , _" said Alan Revercomb , options strategist for I.D.E.A. Inc .
	

    He added , however , that correlations between movements in stock prices and the dollar tend to be fleeting rather_than long-term .
	

    Also this morning , a U.S. investment bank was seen buying 110 $- and 109.50-yen calls in eight $- and nine-month durations .
	

    The mixed views in the market were reflected in a shift in risk reversals in favor of yen calls , traders said .
	

    Risk reversals moved to around par , at -0.2/0.2 .
