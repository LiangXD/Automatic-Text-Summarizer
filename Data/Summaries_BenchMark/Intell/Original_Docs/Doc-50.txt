    The May soybean contract hit a new contract high of $8.68 a bushel on the CBOT's Project A after-hours trading system in Asian trade before settling at $8.67 at 1000 GMT , up 12 U.S. cents from the close of Chicago open outcry trade last Thursday .
	

    July soybean futures climbed 12 cents to $8.70 a bushel .
	

    "_ There must be some traders who expect the USDA soybean stock report to be lower than the market average forecast of 1.091 billion bushels , _" a trader with Korea's National Livestock Cooperatives Federation ( NLCF ) said .
	

    Japanese buyers are also poised to jump into the market .
	

    "_ If the figure is more than 1.1 billion ( bushels ) , it_ 's bearish .
	

    But if it_ 's below 1.05 billion , it_ 's definitely bullish and we_ 'll buy , _" a buyer at a Japanese vegetable oil maker said .
	

    U.S. dealers said last week they expect the stock figure to total 1.093 billion bushels against last year's level of 1.190 billion bushels .
	

    South Korean dealers expect the figure to range between 1.060 billion and 1.165 billion bushels , the NLCF trader said .
	

    Oilseed demand in South Korea remains robust and domestic mills are apprehensive a bullishly construed USDA report could create a spike in prices .
	

    "_ We have to hurry to cover our oilseed requirements for arrival from July onward as oilseed prices are likely to rise , _" a trader with Big Feed Mills said . "_ We also expect a bullish USDA report for soybean and soymeal . _"
	

    The NLCF will tender for 42,000 tonnes of rapeseed meal , 30,000 tonnes of tapioca hard pellet and 8,000 tonnes of grain screening pellet by 0200 GMT on Tuesday .
	

    The oilseeds will be for June to September delivery .
	

    The Korea Feed Association is also expected to seek some 50,000 tonnes of soymeal , and Big Feed Mills is likely to buy 20,000-30,000 tonnes of tapioca a month for shipment from May .
	

    Dealers said edible oil producers are seeking 50,000 tonnes of U.S. No.2 soybeans for April/May shipment .
	

    In Japan , oilseed importers are covered until May shipment , but will probably buy for June onwards if the USDA report is bullish , traders said .
	

    "_ The stock figure is more crucial than plantings .
	

    We may return to the market if the mood turns bullish , _" a purchasing official at a major vegetable oil maker in Tokyo said .
	

    Taiwanese soybean imports , however , are seen remaining flat due_to the sharp fall in demand after foot-and-mouth disease ravaged the country's multi-billion dollar pork export industry .
	

    Philippine soybean and soymeal buyers were also sidelined by high prices and are waiting for the outcome of the USDA report , dealers said .
