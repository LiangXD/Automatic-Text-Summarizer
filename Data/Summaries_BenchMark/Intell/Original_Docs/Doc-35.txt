    THE centuries-old five-dice game of liardice ?
	

    or liar '_ s dice as it is called in North America ?
	

    has a modern problem .
	

    It needs space to throw the dice and this is not practical in planes and trains where it can do most to relieve the boredom of a long journey .
	

    This dilemma for a game with millions of followers worldwide has proved to be a & bquo ; bunch of sixes & equo ; opportunity for Welsh inventor Don Hughes , a self-confessed liardice buff , who claims to have beaten the Far East electronics industry literally at its own game by developing an electronic version that is hardly bigger than a credit card .
	

    The tiny instrument is an interesting example of the latest gate-array-chip technology .

    It generates the random numbers for the dice from reading the device '_ s internal clocks at the instant the & bquo ; roll & equo ; button is pressed .
	

    Mr Hughes believes it is the only such electronic game aimed at an adult market and the only one not designed and manufactured in the Far East .

    It could prove to be a good roll of the dice , for Mr Hughes has also written a book on the mathematics of five-dice games and devised special packaging to exploit the game '_ s addictiveness by allowing it to be played while it is hanging from the supermarket shelf .
