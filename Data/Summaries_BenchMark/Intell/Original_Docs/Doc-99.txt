     Comments: pretty much same as title, but explains what initials stand for in title, so necessary.
	

    News of an unplanned outage at the 1,087 megawatt ( MW ) Diablo Canyone nuclear power unit 2 in central California gave the complex an early boost following the three-day Easter weekend , brokers and traders said .
	

    NYMEX was closed Friday in observance of Good Friday .
	

    But nearby months softened when the operator Pacific Gas & Electric Co said the Diablo Canyon 2 shutdown that began Saturday would only last until middle of this week , "_ That_ 's basically negated because it_ 's shortlived , _" said a Houston futures trader , referring to the outage .
	

    A late sell-off in futures was cushioned by strength in cash power prices and forecasts of snow and much colder weather in the western U.S. for much of the week .
	

    There was also paper maneuvering of second-quarter 1997 positions when April 1 delivery begins tomorrow , brokers and traders said .
	

    Day-ahead electricity prices for firm , peak delivery at the COB rose 50-75 cents to $11.75-12.75 a megawatt hour ( MWh ) , while those at PV firmed 25-50 cents to $14.75-15.50 .
	

    May
	

    COB settled down two cents at $10.68 after posting a high at $10.90 .
	

    June COB ended up eight cents at $11.03 .
	

    Other COB months finished down 10 cents to up 25 cents .
	

    May PV settled unchanged at $15.20 after traded between $15.10 and $15.35 .
	

    June PV ended up five cents at $16.26 .
	

    Other active PV contracts finished three to 16 cents higher .
	

    Market sources said the complex would likely test the upper end of today's ranges Tuesday on the outlook of winter-like weather returning in the West .
	

    In addition to Diablo Canyon 2 , the 750 MW unit 2 at the Mohave coal-fired power plant in Nevada was shut Saturday for planned maintenance .
	

    The unit would stay down until May 11 .
	

    The 1,158 MW WNP-2 nuclear plant in Washington shut since last Thursday for maintenance .
	

    A 750 MW unit at the Navajo coal-fired plant in Arizona was heard still idled for repairs which could take as long as two weeks .
	

    Those outages were offset by the return of the 1,221 MW Palo Verde nuclear unit 3 in Arizona , 1,070 MW San Onofre nuclear unit 2 in southern California and increased power flow on the Pacific Intertie .
	

    Late last week , capacity on the Intertie's high-voltage power transmission lines , linking the Northwest to Southern California , was increased about 20 percent to 6,250 MW .
	

    NYMEX estimated 243 COB and 219 PV contracts were sold , compared with Thursday's 235 COB and 463 PV lots .
