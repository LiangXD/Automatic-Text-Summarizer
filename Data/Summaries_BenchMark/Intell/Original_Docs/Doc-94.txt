    CHICAGO 1997-03-31
	

    Implied volatilities for U.S. interest rate options were steady to higher in quiet dealings , with the underlying futures posting mild declines on the day .
	

    Volatilities at the short end of the yield curve were bid for a second day , as the market continues to adjust for a higher interest rate environment after a prolonged period of stability , Eurodollar analysts said .
	

    June and September mid-curve volatilities each rose to 17.0 percent from 16.3 percent previously .
	

    Mid-curve options expire in 1997 but are priced from 1998 futures .
	

    In quarterly options , June was quoted steady at 8.5 percent , September rose 0.1 point to 12.0 percent , December rose 0.2 point to 13.2 percent , March rose 0.1 point to 14.5 percent .
	

    June 1998 dipped 0.1 point to 15.6 percent and September 1998 climbed 0.2 point to 16.7 percent .
	

    Interest rate futures' selloff late last week provided the catalyst for volatility to ascend , Eurodollar traders said .

    They noted strategies involving puts predominated during the session .
	

    "_ There_ 's a definite bias toward put trades , _" whether purchases or sales , said one floor analyst .
	

    Among the larger transactions in Eurodollar options trading was a Japanese bank's sale of 1,000 June 93.75 puts at a premium of two basis points .
	

    A U.S. brokerage firm sold 500 June 94.00 puts at 9.5 basis points and 1,000 June 94.25 puts at 26.5 basis points , and a third firm sold 1,000 September 93.75 puts at 23 basis points .
	

    Treasury bond volatility held fairly steady , with both May and June options pegged late in the session at 9.5 percent .
	

    Some analysts predicted bond volatility would start to attract a bid heading into Friday's U.S. jobs report .
	

    Bond volatility typically trends higher in the week before the monthly employment figures are released .
	

    However , analysts said such moves have been muted in recent months as the report has failed to spark sharp price swings .
	

    With a 25-basis-point tightening fresh on traders' minds , Friday's employment report carries less significance than if it were timed closer to the date of a Fed policy meeting , bond traders said .
	

    "_ Because the Fed just did that , a_little of the wind is taken out_of it , _" one said of the jobs report .
	

    A U.S. dealer firm sold 1,500 May 107 puts at a premium of 53/64 today , while another firm bought 1,000 May 106 puts at 30/64 and an investment fund sold 1,000 May 106/107 put spreads at 21/64 and 22/64 .
