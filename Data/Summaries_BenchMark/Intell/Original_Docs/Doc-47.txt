    East Asian grain buyers are largely holding back on their corn purchases ahead_of key impending U.S. agricultural data , dealers said on Monday .
	

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture's ( USDA ) quarterly stocks and planting intentions report is due out later in the day .
	

    "_ We_ 're more interested in stocks rather_than planting intentions .
	

    Local feed makers are likely to enter the market if the USDA announces bullish figures , _" a corn trader at a major trade house in Japan said .
	

    Japanese dealers have already finished buying their April/June requirements of U.S. corn , but so_far have only covered 10 percent of their July/September shipments .
	

    Premiums were quoted at between 93 to 94 U.S. cents a bushel over the CBOT May contract , they said .
	

    In South Korea , dealers said local buyers were a_little leery of the USDA report and were largely staying on the sidelines having already covered most of their needs up_to August shipment .
	

    "_ Most of our clients will take some break since they have covered their requirements for far forward shipments to August , _" a trader with a foreign grain trading house in Seoul said .
	

    Elsewhere in the East Asian grains market , the Philippines is to tender , on a a snap basis , for 40,000 tonnes of corn for mid-April shipment and local traders confirmed the purchase by two mills of 100,000 tonnes of Canadian wheat .
	

    The Taiwanese feed market remains battered by the effects of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease which has ravaged the pork industry and is likely to cause a sharp drop in demand .
	

    "_ Feed producers are still working on reducing their corn and soybean inventories , _" Taiwan Formosa Oilseed manager Steven Kuo told Reuters .
	

    Major Taiwanese grain importers said they expect a reduction in corn imports of about 1.2 million tonnes , or 19 percent of the island's 6.5 million tonnes of imports each year .
	

    Regional demand for Chinese corn though , remains generally good on attractive prices relative to U.S.-origin and South Korean buyers dismissed talk of imports from China being pinched by logistical log jams .
	

    "_ We have not seen any problem with Chinese corn deliveries to our clients , _" one trader in Seoul said .
	

    A trader with South Korea's National Livestock Cooperatives Federation ( NLCF ) also dismissed the market talk .
	

    "_ We have heard ( of ) the rumour but there is no problem . _"
	

    Since January , South Korean buyers have bought at_least 1.022 million tonnes of Chinese corn through tenders and private negotiations , traders said .
	

    China is also still offering corn to Japan at a quote of about US$135 $- $136 a tonne FOB Dalian , traders said .
	

    About two local traders have bought corn from this origin , they said .
	

    But other Japanese buyers are holding off believing Chinese offers are still too high .
	

    "_ Chinese corn is not cheap enough , with freight costs around $20 ( a tonne ) China is just trying to export corn to solve their storage problem in corn growing regions , not to earn hard currency , _" another corn trader in Tokyo said .
	

    South Korean flour makers Cheiljedang Corp and Dongah Flour Mills Co Ltd are expected to tender this week to buy 23,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat for shipment between May 5 to June 5 , traders said .
	

    The freight rate from the Pacific Northwest to South Korea was unchanged at $15.50 a tonne , while the rate from the U.S. Gulf was also flat at $25.50 a tonne .
	

    In Taiwan , Pacific Northwest freight costs were seen at about $14.00 a tonne while quotes from the Gulf of Mexico ranged between $24.00 and $25.00 a tonne , both for Panamax-sized March shipments .
