Amman -- Jordan, bound by environmental clauses in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, is currently mulling over signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming even though Washington turned down the protocol six months ago.
Certain steps have to be taken with regard to this objective -- including signing the Kyoto deal, he said.

He announced the government's intentions to sign the Kyoto treaty on Sunday during a workshop on climate change, organised by the ministry and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
In 1992, Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention that compels nations to curb global warming, which is blamed on gases produced by factories and cars that burn fuel.
The Kyoto climate treaty is another international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming.

Asked whether signing the Kyoto Protocol will affect Jordan and US efforts to upgrade the Kingdom's environmental framework, Tbeishat said that signing the protocol will have a "positive" outcome on Jordan.
He explained that both the US and Jordan have different issues to deal with on a national level, including environmental issues.

The Kyoto Protocol was agreed upon by 160 countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
After the Clinton administration signed the Kyoto Protocol in November 1998, the new Bush administration overturned the decision last April, as the US was facing a faltering economy and rising energy prices.
He explained to The Jordan Times that "in Jordan, we conclusively believe that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected."
