The US State Department published its annual report on human rights practices in world countries last Monday.
"The United States has violated the UN spirit of not interfering in other countries' internal affairs," said Jin Yongjian, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations.

"The United Nations has held the high goal of protecting human rights," Jin said.
"The United States has completely violated the UN Charter and the principles of relevant international conferences and documents," he added.
The United States has not only made a procedural mistake, but the facts are incorrect, officials said.

Some Westerners who have been there have also seen the ever-improving human rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region, he added.
The Italian senator's words are in sharp contrast to what was contained in the so-called China human rights report compiled by the United States, which blindly accuses China of restricting religious freedom in Tibet.

To back up their reckless conclusion, the report lists many incidents where it said religious freedom was violated.
The report said China should not have arrested Li, a Hong Kong businessman, who was charged with smuggling Bibles into the country in July.
The United States often says that although al-Qaida members and the Taliban are Muslims, US troops are bombing them because they are terrorists, not Muslims, he said.
