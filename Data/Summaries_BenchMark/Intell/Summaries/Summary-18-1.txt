Steve Elkington birdied the first four holes on the first day and never looked back , beating the best field in PGA history to win the Players Championship by a record seven strokes Sunday .
 Elkington , who won here in 1991 , shot a 3-under-par 69 $-- his fourth straight round in the 60s $-- and finished at 16-under 272 , seven shots in front of Scott Hoch .
	

 Elkington won $630,000 . 
 The 1995 PGA Championship winner vaulted past Mark O'Meara to the top of the money list with $984,400 in just four events .

 He won the Doral Open three weeks ago and joined O'Meara as the only multiple winners on Tour this year .


     For the first time in PGA Tour history , the top 50 players in the world rankings were entered in the same event .
	

     Elkington's margin of victory broke the record of five strokes set by Lanny Wadkins in 1979 and matched by Nick Price four years ago .
	

    Elkington squandered half of a four-shot lead when he bogeyed the final two holes Saturday .
	

     But he shook that off with a solid start Sunday .
	

     His birdie at the par-3 eighth hole extended his lead to six shots .
	

     Elkington bogeyed just once , on the par five 11th when he failed to get out_of a bunker .
	

     The final birdie came on the 18th hole when Elkington chipped in from 30 feet . "_ I chuckled to myself that that_ 's the way it goes when you_ 're playing well , _" Elkington said .

 Elkington assured himself of the biggest win margin and a fourth straight sub-70 round when he birdied the par-4 18th $-- a nice turnaround from his bogey-bogey finish on Saturday .
