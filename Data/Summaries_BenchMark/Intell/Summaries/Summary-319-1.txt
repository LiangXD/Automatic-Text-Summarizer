Allah knows what, the 158 detainees the United States is holding 
in tropical Guantanamo Bay must think they've died and gone to 
heaven.
The detainees should look at the balmy Camp X-ray -- replete 
with running water, three square meals a day and modern medical 
care -- as a sort of Taliban version of Club Med. Call it Club 
Gitmo.

It should be noted that much of the uproar is over photographs 
of the detainees taken as they were being transported from 
airplanes to their cells.
Some people just have to bash the United States.
As for the "unnecessary restraint," one detainee has announced 
that he wants to kill an American before he leaves Cuba, and 
another detainee bit a guard, according to Pentagon spokesman 
Capt. Riccoh Player.

Then there's the reporter who asked Secretary of Defense Donald 
Rumsfeld if American Taliban John Walker will be treated the 
same as the detainees. "
The detainee status gives the U.S. military the leeway to interrogate these former operatives about any future terrorist attacks.

White House spokesman Ken Lisaius rightly noted of the Club
Amnesty International and the comrades are outraged that the 
military is treating al Qaeda captives like prisoners.
You get the feeling that if Rummy booked these tough guys into a 
Motel 6, they'd complain that there's no room service.
