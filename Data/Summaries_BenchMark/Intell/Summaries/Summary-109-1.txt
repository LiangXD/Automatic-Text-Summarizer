9 unconventional ways to improve your home
Every year, somebody publishes a list of which conventional home improvements will give you the best (or the worst) return on your remodeling investment.

You invest in your home to improve livability first, not value.
A shower takes up less space, uses less hot water, and is far more sanitary than a big tub.
Take excess windows from bedrooms and baths and use them to connect the inside of the house with the outside.

4. Keep ceiling heights reasonable for the room size
But each bedroom had at least one door or one window on each wall.

6. Consider the simple elegance of the box form house
Make the toilet and a sink in the master bath accessible to the rest of the house, instead of building a separate half bath - it won't be used much by you during the day, and rarely by guests at night.
A compartmentalized bath puts two sinks in one room and the toilet and tub/shower in another - so three kids can use the bath at once and keep a little more harmony in the family home.
