Apart from criticizing the "axis of evil" countries for abusing human rights, it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti-terrorist alliance.
Consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overshadowing concerns about human rights.

US activities, meanwhile, show no sign of promoting the universal values of democracy, human rights and peace.
The human rights report poses a substantial challenge to the US interpretation of good and evil.
Put simply, what we are seeing is the naked pursuit of US interests.

The report expressly points out that, "It is extremely easy for terrorists to find supporters in countries where human rights are not respected and where individual freedom is repressed."
To prove that human rights are important ammunition in the battle against terror, then, the US must attack terrorism to make human rights matter to these countries.

If US President George W. Bush still believes in the supremacy of human rights, he must not forget the breeding ground for terrorists that exists within the anti-terrorist alliance.
The US is planning to extend military aid to several countries in the alliance to enable them to root out terrorists without using US forces.
Compromising between the interests of many different countries is much better than succumbing to the interests of a single country.
