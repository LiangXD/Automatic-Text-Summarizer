The United States has become the world's sole superpower and the trend of pragmatism in its foreign policy has become clearer and clearer.
The international community and even US western allies, including US neighbor Canada, have consistently opposed the plan.

The responsibility for the event, in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished, lies completely with the US side.
The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that "US crew members were detained by the Chinese side."
It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology.

But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members, major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues to "retaliate" against China.
" The United States views itself as a "major force of anti-terrorism," for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism.

" The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country's attitude toward it.
Before the 11 September event, the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it.
But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it.
