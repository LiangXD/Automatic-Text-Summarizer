CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - The first railway in outer space was 
ready to roll yesterday after astronauts from the space shuttle 
Atlantis prepped it for its inaugural run.
The rail car is part of the 13-metre-long S-0 truss, the 
centerpiece of what is to be a 120-metre girder running the 
length of the space station.

The completed girder will support 
thousands of square metres of solar panels generating power for 
use throughout the station.
Captain Marc Garneau, president of the Canadian Space Agency, 
said Canadarm2 has so far performed flawlessly in its pivotal 
role installing the truss segment.
The massive robotic arm, Canada's contribution to the 
multi-national space station, lifted the truss segment out and 
away from the shuttle's cargo bay and attached it on the 
station's laboratory module.

The arm was then used for the first time to move the 
spacewalking astronauts to different work sites around the newly 
installed truss.
Teams of engineers from the CSA and MD Robotics, the 
Brampton-based company that built the arm, were monitoring its 
work closely from the ground.

The 18-metre arm, which is powerful enough to lift entire 
station modules, was also rewired so it could draw power through 
the S-0 truss.
Eight more truss segments will be added on future missions.
And 
a handcar will be added to the rail system so astronauts can 
move more easily along the truss, which will be longer than a 
football field.
