In the past week, the United States has taken a stand in support of the Saudi Arabian peace plan.
In his subsequent remarks, Bush encouraged Sharon to continue.

The categorical moral condemnation of terrorism is self-evident, but this will not free Israel from the problem it faces.
The last few months have demonstrated that they have become an extraordinary burden.

The high birthrate of the Palestinian population guarantees that it will not be possible to change the population balance of the occupied territories by stepping up resettlement [by the Jewish population].
Terrorism will not be absent from such a country and, in the process, Israel will lose the right to count itself among the world's democracies.

Sharon will not admit that he is planning anything like this, even though the idea has been discussed in Israel.
The Prime Minister should explain once and for all what third objective he might have for his actions.
It is high time for the United States to hurry to offer its assistance.
