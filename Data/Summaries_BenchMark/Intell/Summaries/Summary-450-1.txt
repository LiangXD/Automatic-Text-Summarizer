When Jerry was released from prison, he knew it would take hard work
      and determination to straighten out his life.
The Trustee referred him
      to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill's Career Academy staff
      for job search assistance.

Unemployed,
      homeless and with a prison record, Jerry now faced going back to prison
      for failure to pay child support.
It took some time and hard work, but with the help of Goodwill, Jerry
      was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor's office, find
      housing and conduct a more thorough job search.
With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana,
      many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment.

Of the
      more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999, over 5,000 of them have
      multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job.
With a promising new job at a plastic injection
      molding manufacturer, his legal troubles in check and a safe place to
      live, Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself
      and contributing to his community.

Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement
      services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful
      employment.
With your assistance, Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job.
