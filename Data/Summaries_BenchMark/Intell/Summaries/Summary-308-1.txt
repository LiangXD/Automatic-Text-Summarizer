Endeavour Shuttle To Return On Monday
The Endeavour shuttle is expected to land on the US Cape

The primary objective of the shuttle's mission to the ISS was to 
deliver the 4th ISS crew and research equipment.
On its way home, the shuttle launched into space the Starshine 
micro-satellite, which had been designed by students.
According 
to the Mission Control, the satellite which is no larger than a 
volley ball, has been made by thousands of students who were 
polishing small pieces of glass subsequently putting them on its 
surface.

It is believed that the 
glass will make it possible to see the satellite at night.
Students of several universities, in their turn, will be 
calculating its speed and its orbit parameters.

The 4th long-term expedition to the ISS is led by Russian 
cosmonaut Yuri Onufriyenko.
There are two US astronauts under 
his command - Carl Waltz and Daniel Bursch.
The crew will stay on-board the ISS till May 2002.
