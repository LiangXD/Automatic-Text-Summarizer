"The government wants to point to a significant reduction of climate gate emissions before 2005 after Norway has ratified the Kyoto Protocol in the course of the year," Environmental Protection Minister Borge Brende has written.
Between now and 2008, the government's environmental initiative will be given concrete form in a report to the Storting this spring, in which an early quota system will occupy a central place.

According to the United Nations' climate panel, in the next 10 to 20 years changes in the climate will be almost unaffected by what we do in the way of initiatives in the next few years to reduce emissions of climate gases.
In recent years the RegClim research project, under the aegis of the Norwegian Research Council, has worked to estimate the way the climate will develop in Norway in 30 to 50 years.
The western part of Norway will experience the markedly greatest increase in precipition in the fall.

All the world's countries and peoples are affected by climate changes but it is the poor countries that are being hit the hardest.
Even if developing countries have contributed to these climate problems to just a slight degree, they will bear the greatest burden.

A quota is a right to emit a certain quantity of climate gases during a certain period and this right can be sold on a market.
Businesses that are obligated by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quotas they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions.
The possibility of cooperating with other countries' early quota systems.
