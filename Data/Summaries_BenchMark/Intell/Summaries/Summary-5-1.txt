 In a theatre open to London's often rainy skies , a troupe of actors begins a risky experiment on Wednesday to discover what William Shakespeare's plays were like when first peformed 400 years ago .
	
 It is the realisation of the dream of American actor-director Sam Wanamaker , who died of cancer in 1993 , just as the theatre's wooden framework was being put in place .
	
 Wanamaker had waged a 40-year battle against bureacracy and commercial greed to get the new Globe built just yards ( metres ) from the site of the original on the south bank of the Thames , opposite St Paul's Cathedral . 
His vision is still central to the 30 million pound ( $46 million ) Globe , which begins a "_ prologue season _" on Wednesday with a production of "_ Two Gentlemen of Verona . _"
	

 Notwithstanding his search for authenticity , Rylance's production will depart drastically from Shakespearian traditions .

 The cast of "_ Two Gentlemen of Verona _" will include women and black actors , both unheard of in Shakespeare's day , and the play is set in modern Italy .
