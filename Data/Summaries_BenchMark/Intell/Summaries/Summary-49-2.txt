"_ If the government ultimately decides not to allow the investment , Formosa group will respect the government's policy and abandon this investment project and turn it over to overseas business groups , _" Formosa said in a statement .
On Monday , Formosa appeared to have changed its line , saying that no Formosa unit , affiliate or executive , whether in Taiwan or the United States , had put money into the project .

Central Bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong told lawmakers that an initial central bank inquiry showed Formosa had not illegally sent money to China from Taiwan , state media reported .
The announcements from Formosa and the economic ministry capped a day of uncertainty and intense anxiety over the fate of the giant investment , with Taiwan stocks tumbling 1.42 percent $-- largely on the strength of a plastics sector selloff .
Formosa sought Taiwan approval but backed out two months later after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui urged local firms to slow their investments in the arch rival Chinese mainland .

Lee cautioned that Taiwan must not become overdependent on the booming economy of its longtime adversary lest it become politically vulnerable , and asked Taiwan investors to use their capital at home or elsewhere besides the Chinese mainland .
Taiwan espouses reunification , but not before Beijing implements democracy .

On Monday , Formosa appealed to Taipei not to adopt policies that would jeopardise Taiwan's economic growth , hinting but not saying that bigger China investments were essential .
Taiwan forbids direct China investments , obliging firms to route even small investments through Hong Kong or other third places after obtaining permits from the economic ministry .
Taiwan still bans investment in major Chinese strategic projects such as power generation and carmaking as_well_as banking , insurance and other financial projects .
