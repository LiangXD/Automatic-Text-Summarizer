The Dow Jones Industrial Average was testing critical technical support at the 6600 level on Monday during a second session of steep losses .
Earlier in the session the index hit 6599 before paring its losses .

The Dow fell 140 points on Thursday in a selloff triggered by the move by the 30-year Treasury bond yield over the seven percent level .
The seven-percent yield on the long bond is seen as drawing investors away from stocks into bonds .
Analysts said that a move by the long bond yield through the 7.2 percent level would mean an even more serious psycholgical and technical breakdown for stocks .

Techical analysts said the Dow support around the 6600 level was built by Dow highs in November and December and its January low .
Technical analysts said the put/call ratio has been relatively low in recent sessions , a sign that there was not sufficient bearish sentiment to provide support for stocks .

A higher ratio would indicate investors are buying put options , which allow them to sell stocks at a specified price .
The long bond was down 1/32 to yield 7.09 percent on Monday .
European investors returning Tuesday from the long Easter weekend holiday could add to the selling , leading to a "_ washout _" in U.S. stocks that would provide a near-term bottom , he said .
