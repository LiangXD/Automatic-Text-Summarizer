WASHINGTON - On the face of things, it is hard to see how any 
reasonable person could object to the "war" the United States is 
now waging against international terrorism and terrorist 
regimes.
The targets in the conflict are the common enemy of all civilized men and women, regardless of race, colour or creed; and the magnitude of the threat they pose was revealed to the world on the morning of Sept. 11.

Africa and Asia, there is occasional evidence of the respect 
that the United States can command -- the belief that for all 
its flaws, the United States remains the champion of freedom.
Action is more eloquent than words, and the 
real attitudes of people are often revealed in what they take 
for granted.
And in their confusion of ends 
and means, they make free use of technology and media largely 
developed in that America.

The man, who advanced a mendacious critique of "Orientalism," is himself a product of the scholarship he demeaned; and is able to command audiences in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East because of his success in America.
States took action in Afghanistan, and recently raised the pitch 
over the prisoners issue at Guantanamo Bay.

And even in the 
first hours after the catastrophe, CBC was unselfconsciously 
airing a procession of guests making liberal use of the "but" 
construction.
From British lords down to humble 
skinheads, sneering at the American "vulgarity" confers a 
comforting sense of personal and national vindication, when no 
other prop can be found.
Let us expect more from people born to every earthly advantage, and sometimes less from those born without.
