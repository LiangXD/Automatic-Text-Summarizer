On the afternoon of August 29, after several delays due to various causes, Japan successfully launched its H2A rocket No. 1 into space from Tanegashima Space Center.
Japan previously developed the L and M series of launch vehicles.

These two rockets are primarily used to launch low orbit satellites.
In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket.
In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies.

The satellite doubled the capacity of the test satellite previously launched by Japan.
Military surveillance satellites are also included in its development plan.

In the past decade, despite its stagnating economy, Japan has still put space exploration as a top priority item in its space program.
Between 1970 and the end of 1999, Japan launched a total of 66 satellites.
Japan also has a relatively strong aerospace industry.
