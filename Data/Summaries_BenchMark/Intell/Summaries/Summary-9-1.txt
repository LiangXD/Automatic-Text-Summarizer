South Korea's militant students find themselves isolated from a hostile public as they press a violent campaign for reunification with North Korea .
	
College campuses were the breeding grounds for fearless student pro-democracy fighters willing to sacrifice their lives for the cause .
	
But as democracy began to take root and communism crumbled worldwide , many students abandoned their socialist leanings .
	
 South and North Korea have remained technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict , but relations worsened after the death of the North's Great Leader Kim Il-sung two years ago .
	
Since_then , there have been no official government contacts between the two Koreas .
	
South Korea and the United States have proposed four-party peace talks together with the North and China , but Pyongyang has yet to respond .
	

The students support Pyongyang's vision for a reunified Korea that would leave the governments of both Koreas intact .
	
"_ Only a handful of them are really pro-North Korea .
	

The government knows this , but is playing along that line to receive public support , _" said the opposition academic .
