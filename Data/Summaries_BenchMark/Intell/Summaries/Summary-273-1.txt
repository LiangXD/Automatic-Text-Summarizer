Courtaulds PLC announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value.
Courtaulds' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders.

Courtaulds' restructuring is among the largest far in Britain, though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC's plans to spin off roughly #4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.
The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of #50 million on #980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31.
Courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last year.

Even without a specific takeover threat, Courtaulds is giving shareholders "choice and value," said Julia Blake, an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
In a statement, the company said: "Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies.

Courtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff.
Courtaulds' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence, valuing the entire company at about #1.44 billion.
Some analysts have said Courtaulds' moves could boost the company's value by 5% to 10%, because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined.
