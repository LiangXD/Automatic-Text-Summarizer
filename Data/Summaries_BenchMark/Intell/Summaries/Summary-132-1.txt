Ramsamy also read a joint statement made on Thursday at the close of a meeting of SADC foreign and finance ministers in Blantyre, Malawi, labelling the terror attacks ghastly and barbaric. "

We strongly condemn this ghastly and barbaric act of terrorism and wanton destruction of property and the loss of innocent lives.
The people of the US are known for their strong sense of justice which will no doubt see them through this trying time and bring the culprits to book."

The signing sends a message to SADC of the importance with which the new US administration views regional integration in southern Africa," US ambassador to Botswana John Lange, who is also the special representative of the US government to SADC, said. "
