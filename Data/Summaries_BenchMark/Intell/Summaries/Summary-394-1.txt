Terrorist thugs at Gitmo don't deserve their treatment
Having had the opportunity to tour Camp X-Ray last week, I offer 
America's critics a simple piece of advice: Get a life.

The evil-doers at Camp X-Ray are getting far better treatment than they deserve - hot showers, a warm Caribbean climate and access to the exact same medical care as the military personnel who live on the base.
By way of contrast, the men and women of our military who have 
the extremely dangerous job of guarding these thugs live in 
12-person tents, take cold showers using a hose, and often must 
cope without the benefits of electricity.
As I toured Camp X-Ray, I stared into the faces of evil.

Since their arrival at Camp-X-Ray, some of the terrorists have openly threatened the Marines who guard them and talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing the American people.
There is a greater purpose behind Camp X-Ray than merely 
detaining these violent enemies of the United States.

The type of 
work that is occurring at Camp X-Ray may prove critical to 
preventing a new attack.
President Bush and America deserve appreciation from all corners 
of the globe for leading the world in the war against terrorism 
and for making every nation safer.
Instead of lecturing the United States, our 
critics may better spend their time reminding others that if 
terrorists don't want to be detained at Camp X-Ray, they should 
join the civilized world.
