Russian haste on Belarus union pact questioned .
A leading Russian newspaper on Tuesday questioned the Kremlin's haste in promoting without public debate a treaty creating a union with neighbouring Belarus , reflecting liberal concerns about the pact .

Under the treaty , expected to be signed on Wednesday , the two ex-Soviet states would remain independent but coordinate their foreign , economic and military policies closely .
President Boris Yeltsin gave the green light to the treaty on Monday , and was expected to sign it on April 3 with his Belarus counterpart Alexander Lukashenko , Russian media reported .
The potential transformation of Russia was rushed so quickly that even Yeltsin's allies complained about the lack of debate .

Russia's embrace of Belarus comes at a time of increasing international isolation for Minsk .
In recent weeks Belarus has cracked down on political dissent , and last week ordered the expulsion of a U.S. diplomat .

Some Russian liberals said they fear the authoritarian Lukashenko , who has lagged far behind Moscow in economic reform , could gain a slice of power at the Kremlin's expense , posing questions about democracy , stability and human rights .
Above_all , liberals fear Lukashenko could gain jurisdiction over some decisions affecting Russia under a nine-member Supreme Council which will oversee the Russia-Belarus union .
They said liberals , led by first deputy prime ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov , had tried to prevent Yeltsin's approval of the treaty and that divisions had opened in the government .
