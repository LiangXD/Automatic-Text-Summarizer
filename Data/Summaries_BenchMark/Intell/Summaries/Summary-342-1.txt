Mugabe is trying to move the goal posts to 
disenfranchise people, these people he thinks will vote against 
him," Tsvangirai said, urging voters in line to be patient.
Mugabe's name did not appear on the list at the polling station 
in the Harare township where he had planned to vote.

Human rights groups and many political analysts say that the 
campaign was too tainted for elections to be free and fair.
Police have canceled scores of opposition rallies and Mugabe has 
used his presidential powers to restore controversial election 
laws struck down by the Supreme Court that appear to make it 
easier to rig the vote.
The few pre-election polls reveal voters' fears - with one 
reporting that 70 percent of people questioned refused to say 
who they would vote for.

Lines snaked around polling stations in Harare, one of them more 
than a mile long.
Mugabe, 78, has promised public works initiatives if he is 
re-elected and has pledged to continue his controversial program 
of seizing white-owned farms and giving them to landless blacks.

Tsvangirai, 49, is promising to revive the economy, end 
corruption and promote a more orderly land reform system.
Some 150 people have died in politically motivated violence over 
the last two years, many of them black opposition activists 
believed to have been killed by ruling party militants.
Voting went smoothly in the village of Nkayi, one of the 
communities hardest hit by pre-election violence, about 90 miles 
north of Bulawayo.
