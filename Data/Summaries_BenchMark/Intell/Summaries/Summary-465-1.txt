When Chavez resumed power, a senior US official in charge of national security commented that "Chavez should reflect on himself," as "his ship has been sailing towards a wrong direction for far too long.
The special meeting was initiated by the United States, with only one single goal to fulfill, that is, instigating OPCW member states to vote out Bustani.

It has been reported that the United States had earlier held a secret meeting with a number of countries, promising to pay for their long due OPCW membership fees if they could vote according to the wish of the United States.
After Chavez took office as Venezuelan president, he has pursued an independent foreign policy, and has been out of step with the United States in many areas.
During his visits to some OPEC member states in 2000, he also paid a visit to Baghdad; meanwhile, he has all along maintained a close relationship with Cuba.

As for Bustani, he hoped that Baghdad could become a member of the OPCW so that the United Nations could conduct arms inspections in the country.
To the United States, what Bustani wanted to do was even more intolerable, as it would disrupt the US plan of launching a military strike against Iraq.

Even some major media in the United States have thoroughly unmasked the attitude taken by the US Government towards the cope farce in Venezuela.
This reminds one of a witty remark made by US President Franklin Roosevelt in the old days.
It turns out that in the dictionary used by the United States, the definition of a "democratic regime" is subjected to double standards.
