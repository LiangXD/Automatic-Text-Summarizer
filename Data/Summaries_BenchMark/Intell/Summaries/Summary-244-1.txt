General Motors Corp. 's big defense and automotive electronics unit, GM Hughes Electronics, said net income fell 22% in the third quarter, reflecting declining military spending and slumping GM vehicle production.
Earnings for GM common stock, reflecting the performance of GM's core automotive operations, will be disclosed this morning.

GM Class H, which represents a dividend interest in Hughes earnings, closed at $29, up 25 cents in Big Board composite trading.
The finance unit attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier.
GMAC profits are combined with earnings from the rest of GM's operations and attributed to the company's traditional common stock.

The company has said it wants to boost non-GM revenue to at least 50% of its total business by the end of 1990.
GM Class E, which represents a dividend interest in EDS profit, fell 75 cents to $52.25 on the Big Board.

The earnings drop at GM Hughes Electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and GM's North American automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the Delco Electronics Corp. side of the GM Hughes unit.
In the first nine months, GMAC's earnings fell 8% to $859.5 million from $930.2 million.
Revenue from non-GM accounts was 45% of EDS's total business in the latest nine months, compared with 40% a year earlier.
