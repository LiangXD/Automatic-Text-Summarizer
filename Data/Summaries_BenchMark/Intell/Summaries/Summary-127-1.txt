Military violence constitutes -- in very exceptional circumstances -- a necessary evil in this very imperfect world.
That is a bitter pill to swallow in a thoroughly non-militaristic society such as ours, where the clash of weapons provokes healthy reactions of repulsion.

In the battle against the new forms of terrorism that reached a tragic culmination on 11 September, a limited form of military violence could also not be ruled out.
The fight against the new, transnational terrorism requires an exceptionally broad and committed strategy.
But to build the strategy, targeted attacks on the infrastructure available to Bin Ladin were necessary.

The United States and its principal allies have acted with exceptional caution over recent weeks to the unbelievable provocation of the 11 September attacks.
But they cannot be any real talk of success until the broad strategy against terrorism begins to bear fruit.

There is a real danger that the wounded but not eliminated network will play its "trump card" and commit further acts of terrorism.
The economic impact of the 11 September attacks was already disastrous, with clear effects on the world economy, hitting the poorest countries by far the most.
The whole operation against terrorism can have positive but also unintentionally negative effects on the international stage.
