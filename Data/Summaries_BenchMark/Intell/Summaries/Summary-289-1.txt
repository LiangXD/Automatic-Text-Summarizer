WASHINGTON: The US military on Thursday began flying al-Qaeda 
and Taliban prisoners under heavy guard from Afghanistan to jail 
at the American Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a military 
spokesman said.
An Air Force C-17 cargo plane with 20 of at least 371 
"detainees" being held in Afghanistan departed Kandahar air base 
at about 11 am EST (1600 GMT), Marine Corps Maj.

He declined to say 
when the first prisoners might arrive at facilities surrounded 
by razor wire at the US Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay.
US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters that major 
security precautions were being taken in moving the prisoners, 
including hard-line, anti-Western followers of fugitive 
guerrilla leader Osama Bin Laden.
"The aircraft had departed earlier when the Marines at the 
operating base received fire.

A US Marine spokesman in Kandahar told CNN late on Thursday that 
the gunfire came from snipers that penetrated the outer 
perimeter of the base and was not believed to be linked to the 
transfer of prisoners.
In Washington, US defense officials earlier said that 
unprecedented security -- including chains and possibly sedation 
and hoods -- might be used in transporting the prisoners, who 
include members of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda guerrilla network.

Rumsfeld told reporters on Thursday that every effort would be 
made to secure hardline prisoners, many considered dangerous and 
possibly suicidal followers of Bin Laden.
The Defence Department has not announced any decision on how 
many of the detainees will be transferred or how many, if any, 
might face military courts martial authorized by President 
George W Bush in the wake of the September attacks.
Under close scrutiny from civil rights groups, Rumsfeld has been 
studying how such trials could be held while protecting the 
rights of any defendants and keeping tight security over the US 
war on terrorism declared by Bush after the attacks.
