But losing GEMs could have much farther reaching implications .
	
GEMs are genetically engineered micro-organisms and finding them again could prove vital .
	

So_far , none are known to have been released in the UK . 

The reluctance of UK Authorities to sanction their release ?
for such agricultural purposes as extending the range of plants which harbour nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their roots ?
is understandable . 
 Alun Morgan and Dr Jon Saunders of the department of genetics and microbiology at the University of Liverpool , working with Dr Roger Pickup of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology , Windermere , form one of a number of groups of scientists developing techniques to spot a GEM .

 The researchers have devised a suite of methods based on detecting a marker gene engineered into the GEM .

    This research , to enable identification of a released GEM ?
	

    and its whereabouts ? is essential because_of the risks involved in letting GEMs out_of the laboratory .
	
    There are concerns that , once released , GEMs might exhibit some previously unknown pathogenicity , might take over from some naturally occurring bacteria or pass on some perhaps unwanted trait to indigenous bacteria .
	

    There are also fears that a genetic mutation ?
	

    over which there could be no control ?
	

    could suddenly produce a GEM with some nasty trick up its sleeve .
	
    Official concern was voiced at the EC '_ s Environment Council in September attended by Chris Patten , the UK '_ s Environment Minister .

 Reliable detection is an essential part of the precautions .
