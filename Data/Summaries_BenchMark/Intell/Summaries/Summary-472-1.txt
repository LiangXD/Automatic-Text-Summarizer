The leader of the coup had no sooner warmed the coveted seat than he had to beat a retreat under pressure upon pressure domestically and internationally.
According to US news media, that coup in Venezuela had something to do with the United States.

By the same token, the coup in Venezuela has incurred widespread condemnation and objection from the international community, including the Latin American states, except the United States.
This is far out of tune with the attitude the United States used to take when a coup occurred in other countries.
Just as Venezuela restored its constitutional rule and Chavez was returned to power, the New York Times came up with a shocking story: the US Government and senior military officials were in contact with the Venezuelan coup organizers.

After taking the Office of Presidency, Chavez has implemented an independent foreign policy and seemed to be not in step with the United States in many respects.
But Chavez in his 2000 visit to some OPEC member states made a stop at Baghdad where he held talks with Saddam.

In the past, whenever a coup occurred in some Latin American countries, there was always a backdrop of US involvement.
The only guideline determining US rejection or support of the government of a [foreign] country is whether it follows US baton and whether its domestic and foreign policies are in accord with the US "national interests."
One can see that it is not to be surprised that the United States chimed in with the Venezuela's coup organizers.
