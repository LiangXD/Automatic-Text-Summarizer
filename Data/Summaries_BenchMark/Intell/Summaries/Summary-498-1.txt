Australia's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government.
Plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia's objections.

The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention.
The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states' space projects.
As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port, Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention, Section 14.

The convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory.
"If Australia then denies the claim, we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities.

"The Space Treaty 1967 obliges launching states to open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states in all its activities.
The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour. "
Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967.
