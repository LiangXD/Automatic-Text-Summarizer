A cluster of at least 20 boats of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) mounted the pre-dawn attack on the MV Pride of South off the island's Point Pedro coast, ministry spokesman Sanath Karunaratne said.
Hours before the ferry incident, a navy fast attack craft encountered an explosive-laden boat which blew up in an apparent Tamil Tiger suicide mission, Karunaratne said.

The navy craft had approached the small boat thinking it was in distress as an elderly man, a teenager and another person onboard had put up a white flag.
The navy vessel escaped serious damage or casualties.
Tiger guerrillas, leading a campaign for an independent homeland in the island's northeast, have carried out several attacks against navy and merchant ships, including using boats carrying suicide bombers on more than a dozen naval craft.

The LTTE staged a kamikaze-style assault on a merchant vessel in June last year.
In September 1999, the Sri Lankan navy fought Tiger rebel boats off the island's northeastern coast to prevent the guerrillas from seizing a Chinese merchant vessel.

A Tiger flotilla had been moving towards the 14,000-tonne MV Yugi when it was confronted by navy gun boats, the defence ministry said at the time, adding that the 32 crew members had not been hurt.
The Tigers in August 1997 seized the 6,000-tonne MV Princess Kash off Mullaitivu, on the northeastern coast, while the vessel was taking supplies to private traders in the Jaffna peninsula.
Government forces as well as civilians depend on a vital sea route to Jaffna to provide them with supplies since the land route is held by the Tiger rebels.
