NEW DELHI, April 22 -- INTERNATIONAL call charges have finally started tumbling down, with Bharti Telesonic Ltd -- the long-distance arm of the Bharti group offering tariffs that are up to 40 percent lower than the existing rates.
"The present rate cut of up to 40 percent on peak-time rates is likely to be lowered after Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) and the other ILD operators, who are to begin services, announce their rates.

Interconnect agreements had already been signed with almost all cellular operators.
These nine carriers account for 90 percent of the traffic coming to India.
Carriers will now connect to Bharti's network and enjoy rates that will enable them to offer deep discounts to the end-consumer.

A total investment of Rs 100 crore is planned for the project, of which Rs 75 crore has already been spent," he said.
IndiaOne had laid approximately 14,000 km of optical fibre cable covering 90 cities.

The company has contracted submarine cable capacity from network i2i, and backed it up with satellite connectivity to build in redundancy.
The multiservices platform comprises TDM [Time Division Multiplexing] switch layer, an ATM [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] and IP layer and intelligent network to offer value-added services, he said.
The company, he said, also planned to start offering Internet telephony services in the near future and deploy Voice over Internet Protocol to strengthen its ILD presence.
