It is a pivotal time in the life of a young girl-when
      small changes in her behavior, or the choices she makes, can affect her
      future.
Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring, responsible adult
      volunteers with at-risk girls, ages 8-14.

A Big Sister is a mentor, a
      friend and a role model, helping a young girl to develop the
      self-confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible,
      productive and successful adult.
This is positive proof that Big Sisters one-to-one mentoring program
      helps change lives.
Today, we are offering you the opportunity to help
      change a life.

As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of "your match" and be
      identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office, in the
      agency newsletter and annual report.
Today Big Sisters serves over 1,000 girls in central Indiana.

Over 235 girls are currently
      waiting for a Big Sister.
Imagine the difference the community could make
      if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match!
I encourage you to Join me in presenting this matchmaker challenge to
      your congregation.
