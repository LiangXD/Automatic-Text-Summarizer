RUSSIA : Yeltsin pushes Russia closer to union with Belarus .
President Boris Yeltsin gave the green light on Monday to a draft treaty that would push Russia into a union with Belarus , despite liberals' fears that he might be signing away some of his powers to a hardliner .

Interfax news agency quoted well-informed source as saying an agreement would be signed on Wednesday but added : "_ The most recent version of the text of the treaty should not be regarded as something final and fixed .
Russia , a nuclear state of nearly 150 million people , has been working on forming a "_ community _" with its less wealthy western neighbour of about 10 million under a deal signed by Yeltsin and Lukashenko on April 2 last year .
The union would develop a joint legal system , joint running of energy , transport and communications systems , promote mutual trade and adhere to a common customs policy .

But Kremlin sources said liberals , led by first deputy prime ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov , had tried to prevent Yeltsin approving the treaty and that divisions had opened in the government over the integration plans .
The liberals fear the economic implications of integrating with a state where economic reforms are barely under way and share Western governments's concerns that Lukashenko is not committed to democracy and freedom of speech .

Above_all , liberals fear Lukashenko could gain jurisdiction over some decisions affecting Russia under a nine-member Supreme Council which will oversee the Russia-Belarus union .
Lukashenko , a 42-year-old former collective farm boss , said last week the Kremlin had rejected the notion of forming a single state .
The decision appeared to address at_least some of the fears expressed by liberals .
