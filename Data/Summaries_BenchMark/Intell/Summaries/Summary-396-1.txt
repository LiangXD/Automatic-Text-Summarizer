The 
criteria set by Rice are the following: the three countries in 
question are repressive and grave human rights violators, and 
aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction.
By all conservative estimates, there are scores of other 
countries which can easily qualify as repressive and violating 
human rights.

The rule, as far as human rights are concerned, is that every nation which does not enjoy pluralistic democracy is violating human rights and is oppressive.
Countries which are seeking or developing such arsenal at a slow pace do not seem to come within the scope of the "axis of evil".
One can name more than a dozen countries which are 
contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one 
speed or another.

Come to think of it, acquiring weapons of mass destruction per 
se may not be a correct basis for judging whether a nation is 
good or evil.
The US is the first nation to have developed nuclear weapons.

The US is the first and only nation ever to deploy such weapons.
Washington seems to be particularly disturbed and feel that its 
own national security is being threatened only when the nations 
which acquire mass destruction weapons are authoritarian or 
repressive, irrespective of the pace of amassing weaponry.
This is the fear of all countries, as they feel that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction.
