That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said a month ago would be laid off.
The company also took a write-off of $150 million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts, as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that slow-growing business.

Unisys also noted that it paid $78.8 million in taxes during the quarter, even though tax payments normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss.
The tax payments will leave Unisys with $225 million in loss carry-forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters.
Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter, a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters.

The company also reported slower growth in another important business: systems that use the Unix operating system.
He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year.

That, he said, is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business: It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to.
And Unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter.
Reflecting the concern, Unisys stock fell a further 75 cents to $16.25 in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
