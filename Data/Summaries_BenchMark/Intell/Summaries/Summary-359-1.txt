After months of fear and intimidation, Zimbabweans streamed to 
the polls this weekend in record numbers to cast their votes in 
the country's first contested election since independence 22 
years ago.
Even as voters went to the polls over the weekend, the 
intimidation and attempts at rigging continued.

The government 
slashed the number of polling stations in urban areas where the
In Kuwadzana, there were seven polling stations for 
about 55,000 people.
Rural Bindura had 41 polling stations for a 
smaller number of people.

"The main cheating took place long before election days," says 
Brian Murphy of the Zimbabwe Citizens support group, an 
organization whose members spread around the country this 
weekend privately monitoring the elections.
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at one restless crowd, 
injuring at least 12 people.

In rural areas, many polling stations stood empty by midday.
Old and illiterate voters were assisted by ZANU-PF officials who 
often directed them to vote for the incumbent president.
Despite everything, there is still hope in Zimbabwe that this 
election may bring change.
