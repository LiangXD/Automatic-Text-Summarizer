The protection of Taiwan's interests under the US-Japan alliance structure is fairly strong.
If Taiwan becomes a part of China, all of Taiwan's sea areas will be threatened.

I reckon that at the last stage, the United States will provide the Aegis destroyer to Taiwan.
The most likely method is to use missiles to threaten Taiwan psychologically.
Taiwan has some people who very obviously purposely play up China's use of force to scare Taiwan.

In 1996, the Chinese People's Liberation Army fired four missiles near Taiwan, but this was a kind of propaganda war.
Before the United States attacked Afghanistan, it first explained the reasons to every nation of the world, and China using missiles to attack Taiwan is not simple.

The possibility of the TMD anti-missile system covering Taiwan in the future is very great.
Taiwan announcing independence is not itself a problem, but because Taiwan announcing independence would bring unrest and a domino effect would occur with regard to Tibet and Xinjiang, this is China's greatest fear.
There would be no difference between Taiwan announcing independence to the outside world and the current situation.
