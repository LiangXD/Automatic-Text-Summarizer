Nervous bond market participants on Tuesday morning await the release of the first of two critical reports on the U.S. economy for this week .
The National Association of Purchasing Management's March survey was scheduled for release at 1000 EST/1500 GMT Tuesday .

Such a reading would confirm that the manufacturing sector of the economy remained robust and heighten fears of continued strong U.S. economic growth .
Market reaction to NAPM may be somewhat tempered by the more-watched nonfarm payrolls report looming on Friday .
The Federal Reserve , when tightening last week , said it will respond in kind to strong economic growth going forward .

Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has said that he regards the NAPM as a leading rather_than lagging indicator of economic growth attaching much importance to the figure .
With strong demand and low inventories it would be logical to expect a rebound in the manufacturing sector , Glassman said .

Glassman said the market also may remain stable due_to the lrage amount of news to be digested between now and the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) .
Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting , on average , 182,000 new nonfarm jobs were created in March , compared to 339,000 in February .
Ryding said the market also had probably priced in at_least two more tightening moves over the next four to five months by the Fed .
