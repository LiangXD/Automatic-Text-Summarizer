The camel is without_doubt one of the natural world '_ s most remarkable forms of transport .
	
 With such thoughts in mind , three zoologists led by M. K. Yousef of the University of Nevada gathered recently in Australia to investigate the camel '_ s fuel economy .
	

The focus of their studies was a group of six half-tamed dromedaries , originally part of the feral camel population of central Australia .

     The researchers _' aim was simply to measure the amount of oxygen consumed by the camels under various conditions .

     As each beast ambled at its own pace along a farm track , the team collected its breath with the help of a gas-tight mask and a weather balloon .
	

    Analysis of the gas in the balloon told the team how much oxygen the camels were using as they walked .
   Zoologists have yet to establish the precise mechanisms behind the camel '_ s fuel economy .
	
    One candidate is the leg musculature , which may turn out to be constructed from slower , more efficient fibres than those employed elsewhere .

     Another candidate is the unique stepping gait
