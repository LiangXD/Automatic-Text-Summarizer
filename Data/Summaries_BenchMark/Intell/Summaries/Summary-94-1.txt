Implied volatilities for U.S. interest rate options were steady to higher in quiet dealings , with the underlying futures posting mild declines on the day .
Volatilities at the short end of the yield curve were bid for a second day , as the market continues to adjust for a higher interest rate environment after a prolonged period of stability , Eurodollar analysts said .

Mid-curve options expire in 1997 but are priced from 1998 futures .
Interest rate futures' selloff late last week provided the catalyst for volatility to ascend , Eurodollar traders said .
They noted strategies involving puts predominated during the session .

Among the larger transactions in Eurodollar options trading was a Japanese bank's sale of 1,000 June 93.75 puts at a premium of two basis points .
Treasury bond volatility held fairly steady , with both May and June options pegged late in the session at 9.5 percent .

Bond volatility typically trends higher in the week before the monthly employment figures are released .
Analysts said such moves have been muted in recent months as the report has failed to spark sharp price swings .
With a 25-basis-point tightening fresh on traders' minds , Friday's employment report carries less significance than if it were timed closer to the date of a Fed policy meeting , bond traders said .
