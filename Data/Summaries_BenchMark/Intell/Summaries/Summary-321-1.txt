Steve MacLean, 47, has been assigned to fly aboard the Space
Dr. MacLean will join the Endeavour crew for the 10-day mission 
to complete the next stage of assembling the International Space 
Station.

He will join other astronauts in four spacewalks to add 
trusses to the station and deploy additional solar panels.
Canadarm 2, a crane-like device attached to the station, will be 
used to its fullest extent when Dr. MacLean moves a 
communication aerial from one end of the craft to the other. "
In May, Dr. MacLean will be working at the Johnson Space Center 
in Houston, during the next shuttle shot to the station.

As 
capsule communicator, Dr. MacLean will relay information between 
the shuttle crew and Mission Control during flights.
Dr. MacLean tugged a red Canadian Olympic hockey shirt over his 
blue astronaut flight suit yesterday, telling reporters he 
wanted to get several more for the rest of the Canadian control 
crew to wear while working on the mission in May.

The space station's emergency rescue ship to return the crew is 
a Russian Soyuz spacecraft that can only accommodate three crew 
members.
Space agencies from Russia, Japan, Europe and Canada, partners 
in the space station program, will meet in March to discuss 
their concerns over its future.
Construction of the space 
station began in the mid-1980s.
