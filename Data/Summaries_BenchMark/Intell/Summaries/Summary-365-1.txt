Mugabe Predicts Victory in Zimbabwe's Election
Looking tired but blithesome after more than a month of daily 
election campaigns throughout the southern African country, 
Mugabe cast his vote in a weekend presidential poll, in which he 
is facing a serious challenge from his main rival Tsvangirai.

He told journalists after casting his ballot that he was more 
than confident of winning the election.
Tension has risen sharply in Zimbabwe in recent months, after 
long and sometimes violent election campaigns.
The MDC party has 
accused Mugabe of using violence and other electoral 
manipulation to rig the poll.

While defying international pressure to back down from his 
controversial land reforms, Mugabe has said he needs a new six- 
year mandate to complete the reforms.
Under the reforms, the Zimbabwean government has taken over excess and idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of the country's arable land, to resettle landless peasants.

The European Union imposed sanctions on Mugabe and 19 of his 
close associates last month, while the United States took the 
same move, accusing Mugabe of violating human rights and 
cracking down on the opposition, the media and judiciary.
The controversial land reform is the pillar of Mugabe's 
electoral strategy, which political analysts say could work 
either way.
The March election is a new chapter in his long struggle against colonial rule, which he led from the early 1960s until the country's independence.
