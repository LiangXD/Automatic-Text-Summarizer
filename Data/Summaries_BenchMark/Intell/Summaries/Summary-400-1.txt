WASHINGTON: Unprecedented scepticism and scorn accompanied the 
release by the United States on Monday of its annual human 
rights report amid charges of hypocrisy and double standards 
arising from the ongoing war on terrorism.
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan came up for withering scrutiny at a 
briefing to release the 2001 Country Reports on Human Rights

The report on India, for instance, is more than 100 pages 
long and painstakingly lists incidents of rights violation 
across the country both by the government and terrorist, 
militant, and subversive groups.
Arabia, one of the least free countries in the world, was turned 
over in 32 pages.
The US has shown no inclination to punish 
allies it bankrolls such as Egypt and Turkey while berating 
countries less relevant to it.

In Kyrgyzstan, we talk about the press 
in Kyrgyzstan, and we're going to help fund an independent 
printing press there.
With the demise of the Taliban, 
there is arguably no government in the world that has as bad a 
human rights record as Saudi Arabia does.

Craner: We are talking to the Saudi government about how to do 
that, and we are going to encourage others in the Muslim world, 
in the Arab world, who are trying to make their societies more 
democratic.
We're talking 
to a lot of people across the Arab and Muslim world about these 
issues in their countries and about how they can serve as 
examples to others.
Pakistan's 
decision to eliminate the requirement that religious minorities 
be elected separately from the mainstream electoral system.
