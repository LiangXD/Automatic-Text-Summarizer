Lower imports shrank the U.S. trade deficit dramatically in June , the Commerce Department said Tuesday , bolstering the impression of gradual waning in the economy's vigour .
	
Analysts were surprised by the sharp 3.3 percent falloff in overall June imports to $77.82 billion , while exports held up relatively well , falling just 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion .
	
"_ It says that exports are providing some underpinning for the U.S. economy but overall it tells us that we have sharply weakened in terms of economic vigour and activity , _" said Roger Shields , head of country risk management for Chase Manhattan Bank in New York .
	
Consumer goods exports in June were a record $5.95 billion , up $41 million from May .
	
That partly offset a $138 million decline to $12.32 billion in foreign sales of industrial supplies and materials .
	
The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that reduces the impact of chronic merchandise trade deficits .
	
 Lawrence Chimerine , executive director of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington , said trade benefited in June as the U.S. economic expansion lost some steam and dampened consumers' ardor for imports .
