Enhancements enable up to 500,000 users on a common UC platform; new mobility and federation capabilities extend reach of UC beyond the walls of the enterprise
The new OpenScape UC Suite can now efficiently provide a single UC domain for organizations ranging from 100 to 500,000 users, enabling the highest level of productivity and collaboration for workers across the campus or around the world.

It also provides economies of scale in public and private cloud deployments, creating a unified user experience for presence, messaging, contacts and directories in large multi-site, multi-vendor organizations.
Massively-scaled global UC deployments are now supported with up to 40,000 UC users per cluster and up to 500,000 UC users per system.
OpenScape UC Suite now addresses this need with new OpenScape Mobile clients for Apple iOS and Android.

The mobile clients are app store ready, providing choice and flexibility to users while supporting the growing "bring your device to work" trend.
"The ability to collaborate is becoming a prevailing requirement for mobile personnel, so IT support for the use of leading smart phones and tablets is very relevant," said Jay Lassman, Research Director, Gartner, a leading analyst firm.

"This approach not only enables broader use of the enterprise communications network, but also aligns with the growing desire among people who are already using a preferred mobile device."
OpenScape Web Collaboration now includes a new Mac OS client and a Microsoft Outlook plug-in
"OpenScape UC Suite is unique in the industry for its ability to provide UC to extended organizations of all sizes and to deliver a consistent UC experience on the user's device of choice."
