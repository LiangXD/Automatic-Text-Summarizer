BEIJING, April 11 (AFP) - China on Thursday slammed increasingly close ties between the United States and Taiwan, demanding an end to official exchanges between the two and to US weapons sales.
"We demand the US strictly abide by the commitments it has made to China, correct its erroneous acts or remarks so as to avoid new harm to China-US relations."

Zhang further expressed alarm over Washington's announcement Wednesday that defense department officials will soon visit Taiwan to discuss the sale of eight diesel electric submarines.
"China has always resolutely opposed any form of official exchanges or military intercourse between the United States and Taiwan," Zhang said.
China has considered Taiwan a renegade province since 1949 and has threatened to bring it back by force if it continues to indefinitely refuse proposals for "peaceful reunification."

Beijing has also long refused to establish diplomatic relations with any nation that maintains official contact with Taiwan, although it has encouraged economic exchanges between Taiwan and all nations.
Zhang also bashed remarks made last month by US Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz at a meeting in Florida, attended by visiting Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yao-Ming.

"The United States is committed to doing whatever it takes to help Taiwan defend itself," said Wolfowitz, echoing President George W. Bush's remarks made when he first took office last year.
US officials denied Wolfowitz's remarks reflected a change in US policy on Taiwan.
Chinese missile tests over Taiwan in 1996 resulted in Washington deploying two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region.
