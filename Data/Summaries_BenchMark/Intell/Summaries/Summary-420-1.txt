After we took a look at
the situation, we found that the best solutions to stop thousands of people from
renouncing their religion, is to cut the heads of the Sheiks of infidelity and erratic.
From what we saw, the damage caused by those erratic infidels (Tribes Sheiks, The
Islamic Party) is more dangerous than the Shiites and the peaceful police as people call
them.

You Sheik announced war on those, with the opposings of many sectors and
scholars of decision making.
In the morning infidels announced in their
      satellite channels that Nasr al-Fahdawi welcomed Ibrahim al-Ja'fari in Ramadi,
      then by noon, they announced his assasination, thank god.
The turmoil is over, our
      brothers now are roaming the streets of AlbuFahd without any checkpoints.

Nasr al-Fahdawi, after that he announced his repentance at the mosque twice infront of
Fahdawi for the governor of Anbar, like the Americans promised him, and Abu Raghghal
al-Dulaymi and others thank god, his was eliminated by the brothers inside the city of

Baghdad, until now no one knows who killed him in Baghdad, with all that, our policy is
to eliminate the heads of infidelity without any announcements.
and you Sheik said that yourself god bless you, also in
Fallujah where brothers neglected on killing the heads of infidelity, and what happened
also happened.
Now we have Kabisah, this small village announced this week that 130 policemen
volunteered from there, next day they started working, it was secretly prepared from
before, and the Islamic Party was behind recruiting those policemen, like we proved.
