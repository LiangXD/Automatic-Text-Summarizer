Mugabe victory leaves West in tatters
HARARE: Western countries were left frustrated and impotent 
after Robert Mugabe formally declared that he had overwhelmingly 
won Zimbabwe's presidential election.

The extent to which Mugabe outmanoeuvred the west was made clear 
when southern African countries issued a surprise statement 
declaring the conduct of the election free and fair.
The Zimbabwe registrar-general, Tobaiwa Mudede, declared that 
Mugabe had won a fifth term in office after the results from all 
120 constituencies were returned.
"We find ourselves unable to endorse the 
purported election of President Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's 
president in this election.

In the Harare townships where people stood in line for two days 
to vote in the belief that they were consigning Mugabe to 
history, angry residents looked to Tsvangirai to confront the 
government.
The country took the news of Mugabe's victory with 
no great celebrations or protests.

South Africa, Nigeria and Namibia effectively endorsed the 
election.
The Commonwealth trio to decide on action next week is made up 
of Australia, which will back suspension, the South African 
leader, Thabo Mbeki, and the Nigerian president, Olusegun 
Obasanjo.
In the final results, Mugabe made a net gain of votes compared 
with the 2000 parliamentary election in every province in the 
country.
