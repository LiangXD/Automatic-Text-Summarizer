Sing Technologies posts steady growth .
Diversified conglomerate Singapore Technologies Industrial Corporation ( STIC ) posted a 22 percent increase in 1996 net profit on Monday and said it saw improved earnings in the current financial year .

He said STIC was likely to post sustainable growth of at_least 20 percent in net profit over the next two years , with its industrial park activities continuing to drive earnings .
STIC president Tay Siew Choon told a news conference the group would increase its investment in heavy infrastructure projects , including bridges , expressways and power plants , with a continued focus on China , India and Indonesia .
He said the group was in the process of conducting a feasibility study for an industrial park in Surabaya , Indonesia , with Indonesia's Dharmala group , but added that it was also examining the prospects for a park in Jakarta .

Tay said STIC's leisure resorts on Bintan had only begun operating last year and its industrial park had to realign its focus to attract electronics and engineering companies .
He said the first phase of STIC's resort project on Bintan was likely to start contributing to profits over the next two or three years , eventually helping offset an estimated S$100 million in start-up costs for the second phase .
