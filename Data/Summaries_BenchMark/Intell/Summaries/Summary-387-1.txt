Base officials say there are Christian 
prisoners as well as Muslims.
Base officials are considering 
a special meal for March 10.

Unlike other parts of the base, the camp does not have a pretty 
setting.
One of the guards puts a hand behind the head of the detainee, 
forcing him to look down.
Except for an occasional spitting incident or threat, officials 
say, the prisoners are docile.

The growth of the base has left Camp X-Ray surprisingly close to 
a suburban-style military community of beige, green and yellow 
houses in subdivisions with names like Caribbean Circle and West 
Iguana.
Jerome says the hospital feels no different than a hospital in 
the states, save for the high security and the various languages 
the detainees speak, including French, Russian, Urdu and Arabic.

Fleet Hospital 20 has nine patients today.
An interpreter comes in to talk to the patient.
While calm has returned to Fleet Hospital 20, officials 
elsewhere on the base are bracing for what they say may be 
inevitable: the death of one of the detainees.
