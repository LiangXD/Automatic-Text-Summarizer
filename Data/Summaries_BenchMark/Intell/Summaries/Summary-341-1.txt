Africa's two richest and most powerful nations, South Africa and 
Nigeria, decided to punish Zimbabwe on Tuesday for a flawed 
presidential vote.
Their courageous stand will help renew a 
promise by leading industrialized nations to provide more aid, 
trade, and investment only if Africa shows better governance and 
democracy.

Their endorsement of another type of diplomatic isolation of Zimbabwe shows solidarity with the West.
Mr. Mbeki may still hope that, despite his joining the West in 
criticizing Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe, he can work with 
his troubled neighbor to prevent more violence, keep the economy 
from collapsing, and find some political compromise.
Many of the continent's other governments found 
little fault with the way Mugabe ran the election, despite 
overwhelming evidence of voter intimidation and manipulation of 
polls.

Zimbabwe's opposition says it will only join Mugabe in a unity 
government if he agrees to a new, better-run election.
A strike the week by the country's trade unions protesting the government's tactics reflects widespread disgust with Mugabe.

African peers - he has lashed out by charging opposition leader
Mugabe should not be condoned by African leaders.
His 
stature in Africa and his stand on Zimbabwe's future bring hope 
for African economic renewal and greater democracy.
