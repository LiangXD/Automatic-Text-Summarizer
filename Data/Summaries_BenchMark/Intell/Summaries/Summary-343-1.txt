Guantanamo to hold terror prisoners
The Pentagon is planning to house captured al Qaeda terrorists 
and Taliban fighters for an undetermined time at the base on the 
island's isolated eastern coast, Defense Secretary Donald 
Rumsfeld said Thursday.

The biggest challenge may be getting prisoners from South Asia 
to the Caribbean.
Some prisoners are reportedly being held on 
warships in the Afghan region.
As of Thursday, the United States had an estimated 45 prisoners 
in custody.

As of 1999, 2,400 civilians were on 
the base, including the families of the sailors and Marines who 
manage the port and patrol the fence line that separates the 
base from communist-ruled Cuba.

base by a circuitous flight from the United States.

There is also a gate between Cuba proper and the base that is 
sometimes opened for meetings between military commanders, or to 
repatriate Cubans who have been taken to the base.
Cuban leader Fidel Castro has long argued that the U.S. military 
occupation of the base is illegal, while U.S. officials say the 
base exists under a lease agreement that was part of a 1934 
treaty with Cuba.
Ros-Lehtinen suggested Thursday that the move might raise the 
hackles of Cuba's government, but Rumsfeld dismissed those 
concerns.
