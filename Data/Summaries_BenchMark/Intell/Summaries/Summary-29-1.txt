 IN A RARE display of consensus last week , industry , consumers _' organisations and the environmental movement called for a national committee to examine the social and ethical implications of biotechnology and genetic engineering of plants and animals , Tom Wilkie writes . 

    The proposal came at a meeting organised by the National Consumer '_ s Council , a representative body established by statute in 1975 .
	

    Ann Foster , the council '_ s food policy adviser , said : & bquo ; There should be the equivalent of a Warnock Committee to look at aspects of genetic manipulation other than simply matters of safety . & equo ; The Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology was set up in July 1982 under the chairmanship of Dame Mary Warnock to investigate in_vitro fertilisation and human genetic research .

    The suggestion was supported both by companies involved in biotechnology and by environmental groups .

    The only persistent jarring note came from civil servants responsible for framing safety regulations and administering the various safety committees .


    ICI is in the vanguard of genetic engineering .
   If its research is successful , it should mean the end of mass-produced tomatoes that are tasteless because they are picked before they are fully ripe to prevent wastage during handling .
     
	

    If the product is approved , genetically engineered tomatoes could be on the supermarket shelves by 1993 .
