 Japan's carmakers are weathering turmoil in the palladium market , including a halt in Russian shipments to Japan and volatile prices , without major changes in their purchasing practices , industry sources say .  They also saw few reasons at this stage why the recent difficulties should lead carmakers to reduce the amount of palladium they use in automobile engines .
	
 "_ Palladium prices are still relatively low and we are not overly concerned about the Russian situation , as we expect Russia to resume platinum group metal exports before long , _" he added .
	
 Russian supplies of platinum group metals to Japan have been on hold since the start of the year , when export contracts for 1996 expired and the Russian side indefinitely postponed talks on this year's contracts due_to domestic budget wrangling .
Japanese trade houses have scrambled in recent months to cover the palladium lost from Russian contracts by buying in the spot market .
	
 A purchasing manager at Nissan Motor Co said , however , that she did not feel the palladium market was extremely tight at present , partly because most Japanese carmakers have long-term palladium supply contracts wnith South African mining houses .
