Little ones, like Baby Jessica, caught in the struggle between
      adoptive and birth parents.
Older kids, like Tracy and Kerry, left
      homeless after a recent murder-suicide in Indianapolis claimed Mom and
      Dad.

Pleasant Run Children's Homes began serving children nearly 130 years
      ago.
Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil
      War.
Some come from
      families where, through therapy, there is hope for reunification.

In 1994 Pleasant Run served 346 children and 125 families.
The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given
      the opportunity to become happy, loving, and productive members of our
      society.
