It's not going to be a country club," said Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld last week, describing the new military detention 
camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and nobody ever expected it would 
be.
(The caution makes 
sense; in 2000 Mamdouh Salim, an al-Qaeda operative awaiting 
trial in New York City for his part in the 1998 embassy 
bombings, used a comb to stab a prison guard through the eye.)

International Committee of the Red Cross arrived to inspect the 
camp and offer private recommendations on its operation.
But in 
the European press, the prisoners' lot has become a public issue 
of contention among those who demand that U.S. conduct be above 
suspicion.
The Daily Telegraph, a paper 
usually so conservative that it makes Pat Buchanan look 
vegetarian, warned Washington of the need to draw a "distinction 
between civilized society and the apocalyptic savagery of those 
who would destroy it."

Pentagon has resisted calling the detainees prisoners of war, 
preferring the terms unlawful combatants or battlefield 
detainees.
Under the Geneva Convention, 
those holding true POWs are bound to release them at the end of 
hostilities; but that is the last thing the U.S. wants to do 
with men who may be al-Qaeda operatives.

The Geneva Convention does contemplate that some irregular 
forces captured in battle need not be considered POWs.
Washington says no, because the Taliban had 
no clear chain of command and was not a legitimate government.
Until the Pentagon sorts out the legal issues, criticism from 
Europe is likely to grow.
