OTTAWA - Canadian troops will hand over any enemy fighters they 
capture to the Americans, Art Eggleton said yesterday, 
dismissing concerns from Liberal backbenchers about the 
treatment of Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners by the U.S. 
military.
The official death toll from the Sept. 11 attacks stands at 
3,122, including 25 Canadians.

Mr. Godfrey, a Toronto MP, accused the Americans of violating 
international law by blindfolding and shackling prisoners who 
were transferred this week from a detention centre in Kandahar 
to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Human rights groups have criticized the U.S. military's 
treatment of prisoners captured during its current cleanup 
operation in southern Afghanistan.
Yesterday, a Red Cross team arrived at the Guantanamo Bay 
detention centre to inspect the conditions of the 110 Taliban 
and al-Qaeda prisoners being held there.

Canadian officials met 
with the Red Cross inspectors this week in Ottawa.
About two dozen members of a Canadian 
reconnaissance team arrived in Kandahar on Sunday in advance of 
next month's deployment of the 750-member battle group from the 
3rd Battalion of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry.

JTF-2 members have not taken any prisoners in Afghanistan but they have been on missions in which prisoners were taken, Mr. Eggleton said.
Mr. Eggleton said Canada wants further clarification on how the tribunals that judge the prisoners will comply with international law.
One possible policy, he said, would be for Canadian troops 
operating with members of the U.S. 101st Airborne Regiment to 
simply defer to the Americans when prisoners are being taken.
