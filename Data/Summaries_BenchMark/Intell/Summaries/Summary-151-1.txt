The federal and local authorities are currently preparing the ratification of the Kyoto international protocol on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases.
In a nutshell, benchmarking means that companies compare their energy efficiency with that of similar plants abroad.

Belgian industry is advocating benchmark covenants because it is afraid that an absolute limit would weaken considerably its competitive position with respect to similar companies in regions where the Kyoto protocol is not ratified.
But benchmarking is not sufficient from the viewpoint of economic efficiency (realizing the Kyoto restrictions on emissions at the lowest possible costs for the whole of society).
A cost-efficient division of efforts implies that each sector must limit its emissions to the point at which the additional costs for one extra ton of reduction are the same in all sectors.

The costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth.
If industrial greenhouse gas emissions increase considerably over the next 10 years, that will have to be offset by a commensurate reduction of emissions in the transport sector, services, households, and so forth.

The European proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is irreconcilable at first sight with the Flemish benchmark covenants.
The benchmark covenants could be opportune for settling the initial allocation of emission rights.
By using the benchmark covenants to allocate emission rights initially, the good points of covenants are retained and their drawbacks are eliminated.
