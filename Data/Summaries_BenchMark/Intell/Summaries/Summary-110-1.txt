Mr Tsvangirai endorsed a United States proposal for targeted sanctions against President Mugabe and members of his Government but said full economic sanctions would be a ruinous mistake.
Mr Tsvangirai called for international action to ensure a free and fair presidential election.

But he opposed any steps that could plunge the country deeper into a recession that has already pushed unemployment, inflation and interest rates above 60 percent.
Mr Tsvangirai might face charges of contravening the Law and Order Maintenance Act for allegedly threatening to violently remove President Mugabe from power last year.
His trial was set to start at the High Court in May but the case was referred to the High Court after he challenged the legality of LOMA in the Supreme Court.

The superior court has since heard State and defence arguments on the legality of the charges being laid against the opposition leader and reserved judgment.
If the Supreme Court rules in favour of Mr Tsvangirai, who if convicted on the charges might face life imprisonment, the Attorney General's Office will have to draw up a new charge.

But if the appeal fails, the matter will be referred back to the High Court for trial.
The MDC leader also alleged that the Government was trying to provoke protests that could be used as an excuse to suspend democracy.
"But anyone who wants to speak the language of violence where Zimbabwe is concerned is playing with fire.
