President unleashes army, rocket launchers, MiG-21s
HARARE, Zimbabwe - Elements of Zimbabwe's army began leaving 
their barracks yesterday in an ominous sign that Robert Mugabe 
intends to rig this weekend's presidential election and is 
preparing for a fight if the opposition challenges him.

In Harare yesterday, Michael Quintana, editor of Africa Defence 
Journal, said he had toured military barracks in the capital and 
found soldiers were moving out in small groups of three trucks 
at a time.
His ruling Zimbabwean African National Unity-Patriotic Front party has moved to disenfranchise thousands of supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
The party says 22 MDC election monitors have 
been abducted.

The voting rolls include the names of as many as 80% of the 
people in Zimbabwe who have died in the past two years, while 
thousands of the living will not be allowed to cast their 
ballots.
The MDC says as many as 34 of its supporters have been killed 
since the presidential campaign began in January and fears are 
rising there will be an explosion of violence next week, no 
matter what the result of the election.

Zimbabwe's army chief has already warned about the result of a 
Tsvangirai victory.
The leaders of the Zimbabwean Liberators' Peace Forum, an 
association of mainly Matabele veterans who fought in the 
Rhodesian war through the 1970s, issued a dramatic request for 
help from both within Zimbabwe and beyond.
"We are willing to defend the interests of the people of 
Zimbabwe at all costs and will not stand idly by if the election 
is clearly not free and fair," he said.
