A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success
      stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill's help.
Your gift to Goodwill will
      help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly
      support our work.

Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities.
After Maureen's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant,
      we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with
      physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in
      the middle of society.
Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance.

Goodwill prepares people for life-long employment.
Cornell found a
      number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a
      work-site injury forced him out of his job at a foundry.

Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill.
I rode a
      bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow.
Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their
      own stories of success.
