SHANGHAI, Oct 16 (AFP) - Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar warned Tuesday that prolonged military attacks on Afghanistan could destabilise the Islamic world and reiterated calls for the US to end the campaign quickly.
Syed Hamid said the international community must deal with terrorism rationally and form a new "security architecture" to combat what he described as a "new dimension of crime against humanity" in the long term.

"Over the long term, we have to look at how terrorism manifests itself and have an international convention where terrorism is properly defined and where it is considered as a crime against humanity so there can be a proper tribunal."
Syed Hamid said critics must also accept that the war against terrorism could affect civil liberties.
"One cannot be too philosophical or idealistic about civil liberties when they can jeopardise peace and security, law and order in a country."

Opposition groups in Malaysia have expressed concern that the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is using the US-led war on terror as a pretext to crack down on legitimate dissent.
Mahathir will be among APEC leaders, including US President George W. Bush, convening in Shanghai this weekend for an annual summit.

The declaration was necessary because terrorism was the "most dangerous enemy of law-abiding citizens and an affront against law and democracy", Syed Hamid said.
Predominantly Muslim Malaysia supports the US hunt for terrorists but opposes the attacks on Afghanistan.
Mahathir has urged the United Nations to convene an international meeting on terrorism.
