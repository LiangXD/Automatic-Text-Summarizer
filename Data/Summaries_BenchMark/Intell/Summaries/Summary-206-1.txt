The Annual Human Rights Report of the US State Department has been strongly criticized and condemned by many countries.
Evidence show that human rights violations in the United States have been ignored for many years.

The United States has been preparing annual reports on human rights in 190 countries for 25 years while ignoring the real situation at home.
World analysts remarked that the US evaluation of the practice of human rights in other countries depends on the level of political relations between the United States and those countries.
This year, the US report devotes many pages to commenting on human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iraq.

The US judgment of the practice of human rights depends on US interests as well.
Such a criticism is absent in the 2001 human rights report as the United States is planning to try the al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees in military courts while refusing to grant them POW status.

It is clear that the United States pays no attention to fundamental human rights unless they serve its political purpose.
Many Americans have given evidence to prove the wrong judgment of their administration against human rights in other countries, especially in Vietnam.
The Annual Human Rights Report released by the US State Department is not convincing as it is inaccurate and fabricated.
