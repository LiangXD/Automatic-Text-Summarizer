THE British farmer is about to wander into fresh woods and pastures new .
In the course of doing so he could change the face of Britain .
He could also go broke ?	
last year , farm incomes fell by 25 per_cent .
Britain is over-producing : there will have to be some way of reducing output .
	

    There is a Ministry proposal called & bquo ; extensification . & equo ; It means that the whole farm has to produce 20 per_cent less .

    One scheme is already in place .
	

    It is called & bquo ; set aside . & equo ; A proportion of the farm ?
    Either way , the countryside changes .
	

    There are various calculations about how much land is potentially redundant : it could be as many as three million acres .

    For the first time in decades , the nation has a chance to decide what to do with it .

    Conservationists , farmers and government agencies all agree that there is an opportunity right_now for debate and then decision .
	

    But there is no debate , and any decisions are likely to be taken , piecemeal and by default .
	

    On the horizon is a field of view overgrown with nettles , which no one seems to want to grasp .
    There is a big fear in the hills that in_order_to maintain businesses in the lowlands , people will diversify into sheep , and the profitability of sheep in the lowlands will be greater . & equo ;
    In fact , the Countryside Commission has just announced an imaginative scheme for 12 & bquo ; community forests & equo ; on marginal urban fringe farmland .
	
The National Farmers _' Union does n't like the idea of set aside .
	

    In the first place , the scheme only operates for five years , with no guarantee of continuation .


    There are also emotional objections . & bquo ; We wish to see as many farmers as possible occupying the countryside , & equo ; said Melinda Appleby . & bquo ; We want to see a working countryside and we do n't want to see it fossilised so it '_ s almost like a theme park . & equo ;
	

    Farmers have higher hopes of the & bquo ; extensification & equo ; programme in the wings .
	

    Under this , farms would have to reduce output by 20 per_cent .
    
    & bquo ; In the future , it seems , we are going to be taking arbitrary decisions about what we want from the countryside : the large blue here , a certain bird there , and we are going to manage for those species , which will mean that everything_else will go . & equo ;


    The point is , that for the first time in decades , the environmentalists have a powerful voice ?
	

    and a Government which claims to listen .

    Both the farmers and the conservationists agree that there ought_to be a debate .
