Italy on Tuesday pressed on with preparing a multinational security force to deploy in lawless Albania and tried to ease strained relations by calling for a joint Rome-Tirana inquiry into the sinking of a refugee boat .
Grief and anger throughout Albania cast a shadow over Italy's plan to lead a force of about 2,500 troops or police to protect deliveries of food and medicines in the Balkan state , which has been racked by armed unrest for three months .

One key point of deployment is Vlore , the Adriatic port where the ill-fated refugees set out on Friday .
Residents in the town have vowed revenge if Italian troops arrive .
Survivors accused the Italian navy of ramming their vessel to stem a flood of refugees after about 13,000 fled across the Adriatic in March .

Prodi said that the incident must not be allowed to taint previously close ties and his government has insisted that the tragedy makes the mission ever more urgent to stem a tide of refugees .
In Washington , the United States said it would not take part in the multinational force but would consider requests to support it .

A rebel-held army munitions depot was in flames near the southern town of Gjirokaster and explosions could be heard in the town three kms ( two miles ) away , witnesses said .
The shops of the Vefa investment company , often associated with the failed pyramid schemes , were looted in the southern town of Berat .
The state ATA news agency said the town was still gripped by fear , with residents defending the apartment blocks at night .
