The tragic and shocking events that shook the United States, destroying a number of its economic, urban, and military landmarks, have aroused grief and sorrow worldwide.
This is because the terrorist violence has struck innocent women and children and defenseless civilians.

If any people are going to be moved by the scenes of destruction that involved Manhattan, the World Trade Center, and the Pentagon, it is the Palestinian people.
For Israel to take advantage of the US tragedy to claim that it is standing in one ditch with the United States against the violence of terrorism, this is a twisted logic.
This is because Israel is an occupation state, one that is persecuting the Palestinians and denying them the right to exercise their national and sovereign rights.

Such a comparison would be theoretically valid if Israel withdrew from the occupied territories but the violence of terrorism against it continued.
It is very important for the United States to realize the difference between the US and Israeli cases.

The Palestinians want nothing from Washington but to understand their cause and stand beside right and justice.
What is required of Israel is to withdraw, both on the military and settlement fronts, from the territories occupied in 1967, and the United States should push its ally Israel in that direction.
This would put an end to sensitivities, hatred, and injustice and spread peace in the region and the world.
