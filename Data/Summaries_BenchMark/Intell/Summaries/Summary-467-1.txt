His task was to create "a peaceful environment" in the region currently affected by an unrecognized and undeclared war between Israel and Palestine.
Another round of talks will be held today between Powell and the chief players in the Middle East.

The impression is that, under US sponsorship, the international community deliberated too long about the violence in the Middle East.
The latest round of violence was initiated on the day in September 2000 when Ariel Sharon took it upon himself to provoke his Muslim neighbors by visiting an Islamic religious building.
With an average $3 billion military aid for Israel and a strong Jewish lobby at home, the Untied States cannot play any other role in the Middle East conflict but protector of the Israeli state.

In its warnings and appeals for peace, the United States openly "takes a side" in this conflict, labeling the other side terrorists, similar to those who carried out the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York.
It is worrying that among Powell's priorities in Beirut were the talks on the activities of the Hezbolah, with an announcement that terrorists might open a new front.

The international community received a lot of negative points for the Middle East.
Israel did not even have the goodness to look at this plan, demonstrating arrogance toward everything Arab.
In the same manner Israel asked Arafat to leave Ramallah and Palestine, labeling him a troublemaker and politician incapable of controlling the Palestinian suicide bombers.
