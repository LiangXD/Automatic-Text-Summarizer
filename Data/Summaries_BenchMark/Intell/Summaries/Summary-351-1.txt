LONDON: British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Tuesday 
there was already "pretty strong" early evidence that President 
Robert Mugabe had "stolen" the election in Zimbabwe.
President Mugabe, in the event he is declared the winner, has 
stolen the election, then that has enormous implications for the 
nature of our relationship with Zimbabwe," he warned.

"This is a terrible period, not only for Zimbabwe but for those 
who hold the course of democracy dear in Africa and elsewhere."
Straw said there had been 
"every sign" of intimidation by Mugabe's Zanu-PF party up to the 
close of polls as well as many reports of irregularities since 
then, including shortage of polling booths in urban areas and 
harassment of opposition election agents in rural areas.
