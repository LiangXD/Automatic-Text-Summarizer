Mr. Taylor also was named a director, increasing the board to 22, but is not part of the new office of the chairman.

H. Marshall Schwarz was named chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Trust Corp., a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $17 billion.
Mr. Schwarz, 52 years old, will succeed Daniel P. Davison Feb. 1, soon after Mr. Davison reaches the company's mandatory retirement age of 65.
U.S. Trust, a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the U.S., has faced intensifying competition from other firms that have established, and heavily promoted, private-banking businesses of their own.

U.S. Trust's earnings have been hurt.
U.S. Trust recently introduced certain mutual-fund products, which allow it to serve customers with minimum deposits of $250,000.

"We have always taken smaller accounts, but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow," Mr. Schwarz says.
Mr. Schwarz also said costs associated with U.S. Trust's planned move to midtown Manhattan from Wall Street will continue to be a drag on earnings through 1990.
U.S. Trust also created a four-member office of the chairman, effective Feb. 1.
