Taiwan Caucus a US Provocation: Commentary
It is claimed that the caucus will serve as an official channel 
for legislators from both the United States and the island to 
exchange ideas.

On a more dangerous level, it may provide 
fodder to Taiwan's military forces and play into the hands of
One of the group's goals is to promote US military ties with 
Taiwan.
This comes at a time when there have been conspicuous signs of 
ever-increasing US-Taiwan military ties.

In mid-March, the US side granted Taiwan "Defence Minister" Tang 
Yiau-ming a visa so he could attend a conference sponsored by US 
military contractors in Florida.
On the sidelines of the 
conference, he met senior Bush administration officials 
including Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Assistant 
Secretary of State James Kelly.

"President Bush reaffirmed the US promises to all Taiwanese and 
repeatedly declared he would abide by the Taiwan Relations Act - 
to provide Taiwan with the necessary protection against 
Beijing," Chen was quoted by the Taipei Times as saying.
Helping Taiwan build its military muscle will only foment 
pro-independence forces.
Since the latest remarks and events may 
give these forces the impression that the United States is on 
their side and ready to provide military protection, they may 
become provocative enough to push the island to the edge.
