 Net profits posted by Indocement , a major Indonesian cement manufacturer , in 1996 are above market estimates and installation of additional production capacity in 1997 and 1998 should keep the company in good stead , analysts said . 
However , Partono said the company had instituted changes in its accounting system in 1996 which partially accounted for the above-expectation earnings .
	

 Aside_from changes in the accounting method , he also said the stable growth of the company's food division at about 15 percent per year had contributed to earnings growth .
	

 However , Partono said he expected Indocement to perform only in line with the broader market and not exceed it .
