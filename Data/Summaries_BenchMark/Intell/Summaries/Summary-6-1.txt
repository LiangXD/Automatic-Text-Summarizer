 Measures by the National Bank of Slovakia to ease the country's money supply may not be working , as a mounting liquidity surplus continues to drive prices down on the money market , analysts said on Tuesday 
"_ The central bank will have to take other measures to stem the money supply , as the effect of the tool it chose to do so is partly eliminated by short-term foreign capital inflows , _" Jozef Bozek of Tatra Banka told Reuters . 
 NBS officials were not available for comment , but the central bank has said it is still "_ early _" to analyse the effect of the measures , and warned it could even resort to imposing credit limits on banks if its money supply measures would not work .
