Regulators will host an auction Tuesday that supporters promise will usher in a new breed of nationwide radio service but critics charge may cost U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars in lost revenue .
Up for grabs are two licenses to provide radio programming that will be beamed coast-to-coast via satellite .

Digital radio will offer listeners CD-quality sound and specialized programming that can be tuned in anywhere in the nation .
The FCC resolved a long-standing dispute among its four commissioners in early March by limiting the auction to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital radio .
Two of the commissioners $-- Chairman Reed Hundt and Susan Ness $-- favored opening the sale to any company wanting to bid .

But in the end they agreed reluctantly to limit the auction so the launch of digital radio would not be delayed further .
Hundt said that if other companies value the digital radio airwaves but are "_ arbitrarily excluded from the auction , it is safe to predict that the auction winners will simply sell their licenses to those companies .

Commissioner Rachelle Chong contended that opening the bidding would have been unfair to the four .
Listeners will have to buy a special radio receiver that will cost about $200 , on top of the price of a regular radio .
If it wins a license , DBSC plans to deliver regional programming throughout the country .
