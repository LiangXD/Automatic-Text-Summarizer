United States President George W. Bush finally announced his country's proposal for fighting the greenhouse effect.
The Bush plan makes the reduction in pollution gas emissions conditional on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate.

Emissions of the gases should rise at a slower pace than that of the GDP, he says.
The first problem pointed out by critics is that Bush has created a new concept, that of "greenhouse gas intensity," which could be defined as the volume of gas emissions divided by GDP.
It is the index that will be reduced, according to the White House, by 18 percent over the next 10 years.

That so-called 18 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could represent a real increase in the absolute quantity of such gases.
More important are two indisputable conclusions, both potentially embarrassing to the Bush administration and extremely threatening to the world as a whole.

The long- standing ties Bush and several of his leading advisors have with these companies allow us to suppose an ultimate conflict of interests that would only increase with the government's persistent alignment with their goals.
The second conclusion is that, contrary to what some optimists were predicting after 11 September, Bush seems to have decided to stick to a course of arrogant unilateralism when conducting his foreign policy.
The break with Kyoto had been a pre-attack marker in the Bush administration, for having demonstrated the latter's absolute indifference to the opinion of even its closest allies, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan.
