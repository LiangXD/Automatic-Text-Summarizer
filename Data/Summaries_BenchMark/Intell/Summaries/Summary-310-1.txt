Africa Endorses Mugabe Victory, the West Condemns It
International reaction to the controversial re-election of 
Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe to another six year term 
varied widely.

African observers generally approved of his 
victory, while Western governments denounced it.
President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya congratulated Mugabe, calling 
his victory "testimony of the confidence and high esteem the 
people of Zimbabwe hold in you."
The observations of the 14-member Southern African Development 
Community (SADC) Parliamentary Forum team differed considerably 
from the other African missions.

Network which had 400 observers monitoring the poll and have 
been heavily critical.
The SADC parliamentarians' view was also echoed by the Norwegian 
observer delegation which said, on Tuesday, that the election 
failed to meet international standards.

Jan Petersen said in a statement that "The presidential election 
in Zimbabwe has not satisfied the fundamental requirements for a 
democratic election."
Mugabe's main challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for 
Democratic Change, has rejected the outcome of the presidential 
poll.
Mugabe was announced the winner with 56.1 percent of the vote, 
leaving Tsvangirai trailing behind with 42 percent.
