San Francisco 49ers quarterback Alex Smith has reportedly joined the search for a missing California girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago on her way to school.
Smith was among 581 volunteers who turned out Saturday to search for 15-year-old Sierra LaMar, of Morgan Hill, Calif., who was last seen March 16, the Contra Costa Times reported.

The potential evidence, part of a series of items discovered by volunteers, will be sent to the county crime lab for testing, authorities said.
But authorities noted that the items were found in an area known to authorities as a place where underage people go to drink alcohol and party.
Police dogs searching for the girl lost her scent on the driveway of her home.

The teenager usually walked from her home to a nearby bus stop, but a bus driver said he saw no sign of her.
LaMar's phone was recovered shortly after her disappearance about three-quarters of a mile from her home after police tracked its electronic ping.

There is currently no person of interest in the case, and police are still treating it as a missing person case.
The girl's father, Steve LaMar, who lives some 40 miles away in Fremont, is a registered sex crimes offender but is not considered a suspect in the case.
Sierra LaMar is described as 5 feet, 2 inches tall, with brown hair.
