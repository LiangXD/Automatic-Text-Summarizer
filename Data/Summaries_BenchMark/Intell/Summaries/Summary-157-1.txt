The directive is issued at a time when the American government is claiming to lead the fight against terrorism throughout the world.
When the Imam (may God be satisfied with him) issued the fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the holy Koran, the countries that are so-called supporters of human rights protested against the fatwa.

In a coordinated move the European countries all recalled their ambassadors from Tehran in order to put the Islamic Republic of Iran under pressure.
By clarifying the Imam's edict the Islamic Republic of Iran made the people of the world understand that insulting the Prophet was violating the rights of millions of people throughout the world.
Now the United States has issued an assassination order against millions of human beings without having any proof, reason or documentation.

The only reason for this would be opposition to the United States.
It would be appropriate for all Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the United States.

If the European countries were honest in the withdrawal of their ambassadors from Iran, blaming Iran for violating human rights, then they should recall their ambassadors from the United States.
After all the United States is not violating the rights of one human being, but many many human beings.
The United States thinks that it can silence the justice-seeking cries of the peoples of the world with the sound of explosions from 7-ton bombs and it thinks that it can justify its own inhuman behavior in the shadow of this noise.
