Engineers suspect the one-ton car floated ever so slightly off 
the rail, causing the magnetic sensors on the bottom of the car 
to lose contact with a pair of iron strips in the aluminum 
tracks.
The track runs along a 44-foot 
girder that space shuttle Atlantis' astronauts delivered and 
bolted to the orbiting outpost last week.

Right on cue, the car stopped at a work station and was 
automatically latching itself down when everything came to a 
halt.
Space station astronaut Carl Walz sent another computer command 
from inside to get the railcar moving again.
The railcar 
smoothly rolled 26 feet to a second work station, where the same 
thing happened.

Ground controllers had to take over manual control to secure the car.
There is no danger of the 
$190 million railcar rolling off the track because of rings on 
both ends of the 44-foot girder, Sellari said.

The first use of the railcar is set for late summer.
The railcar 
is needed to transport the space station's 58-foot robot arm 
from one end of the outpost to the other as more girders are 
installed.
Atlantis' astronauts plan a fourth and final 
spacewalk today to finish installing the girder.
