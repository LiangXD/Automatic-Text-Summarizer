 Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto , moving to tackle his biggest political problem , vowed on Monday to push through legislation to extend land leases for U.S. military bases beyond a May deadline . 
 The new legislation will , in effect , give the Japanese government a temporary extension of its leases on land occupied by the U.S. bases after the current contracts expire .
	

Hashimoto faces a May 14 deadline on the leases on land owned by some 3,000 people on Japan's southern Okinawa island , who are refusing to renew the contracts .
	

Another 29,000 landowners have already agreed to renew their leases .
	

Without the proposed revisions to the land laws , the government would be "_ illegally _" occupying the land .
	

Local authorities on Okinawa , where about half of the 40,000 U.S. troops in Japan are stationed , want the bases closed by 2015 but Tokyo strongly opposes such a move .
