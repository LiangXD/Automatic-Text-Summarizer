Billions of investors' dollars are pouring out of the nation's junk-bond mutual funds, undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market.
In the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says.

Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices. "
If the heavy outflows continue, fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead.
Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds, too.

About 98% of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds, says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going into money market funds.
People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again, some analysts and fund specialists say.

Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues, such as RJR Nabisco, to raise cash to meet expected redemptions.
Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers.
Asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far.
