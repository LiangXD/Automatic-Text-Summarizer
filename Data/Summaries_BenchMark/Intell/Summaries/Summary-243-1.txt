Westinghouse Electric Corp., capitalizing on a major restructuring program, expects operating margins of more than 10% and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year, top officers told securities analysts .
Westinghouse expects to meet its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy.

GNP is the total value of the nation's output of goods and services.
A bright spot is the company's power-generation business, which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years.
Mr. Lego said the company foresees the need for a major boost in new-generation capability throughout the 1990s.

Westinghouse also is well positioned to sell steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers.
The company's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mr. Lego said.

The company is negotiating with the Soviets to build a Thermo King truck-refrigeration plant that would produce about 10,000 units annually.
Company officials also said that any gain from the sale of Westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of Asea Brown Boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise 8.5% annually through the next three years.
