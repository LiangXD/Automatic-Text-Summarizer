Finch soars on 1st over-water leg of Earhart flight .
Linda Finch , the Texas businesswoman and aviator who is retracing the flight of the legendary Amelia Earhart 60 years ago , took off on Monday on the first over-water leg of her round-the-world journey .

Hundreds of spectators waved and cheered as Finch , dressed in a beige flight suit , climbed into the cockpit of the Electra and revved the engines .
Trailed by a blue Grumman amphibious plane that will act as her safety net , Finch left Miami after a week of meetings with schoolchildren , preparations on the Electra and a_bit_of fishing , as Earhart is said to have done six decades ago .
Finch's aides say the pilot is reluctant to compare her flight to Earhart's , believing the message of the pioneering aviator's cause was lost in the mystery of her disappearance .

Earhart , the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic , completed 22,000 miles ( 35,400 km ) of her journey and vanished in July 1937 on the leg from New Guinea to Howland Island .
Jane Logman of the Netherlands , the wife of a pilot , said Finch was a role model to her 15-year-old daughter , who had just begun pilot training .

World Flight is sponsored by Pratt & Whitney , a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp , which distributed a free educational program to schools throughout the United States .
Bob Malott , a United Technologies director , rode with Finch and Fodge on the Electra to Puerto Rico .
The education program was designed to teach students about Earhart and to spur interest in science , math and geography .
