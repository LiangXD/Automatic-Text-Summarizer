When the local currency rapidly decreases in value, it is a sign 
of serious economic trouble.
In the past four months, the shekel 
has lost 20 percent of its value against the dollar.

We still have a way to go before our economic crisis reaches Argentine proportions, but there is little doubt that unless drastic measures are taken, we are on the way.
Confidence in the local currency is an essential element of a 
sound economy.
The rapid 
drop in the value of the shekel is a sign that confidence in it 
is waning.

Sound management of the economy is an essential element in the 
conduct of the war against Palestinian violence and terrorism.
While it was already clear 
that the economy was well on its way to a recession, the 
ministry's bureaucrats forecast continued growth for the 
economy.

The ministry realized the budget it had prepared would have to be drastically revised and curtailed.
Then the finance minister dramatically announced an emergency 
economic plan based on large-scale tax increases in an already 
over-taxed economy.
But successful management of the economy - the second 
front - is essential so that the resources needed for defense 
needs can be made available without causing serious damage to 
the economy.
