China plays down friction with US over Taiwan
BEIJING: China played down sensitive differences with the United 
States over Taiwan on Thursday, with President Jiang Zemin 
holding his tongue over US commitments to arm the 
diplomatically-isolated island.

Jiang portrayed talks with US President George W. Bush on the 
issue as low-key, telling reporters both sides had "expressed 
opposition to 'Taiwan independence' and the hope of solving the 
Taiwan question peacefully".
But in a clear signal of continued support for Taiwan, Bush said 
he would honour a pledge to help arm the island China has 
regarded as a rebel province since a 1949 civil war split.
We believe in peaceful settlement of this issue," Bush told a 
news conference after talks with Jiang on the first day of his 
visit.

The United States passed the Taiwan Relations Act in the same 
year as it switched diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing 
in 1979, reaffirming its commitment to Taiwan and pledging to 
maintain arms sales to the island.
Bush's statement will come as a relief to Taiwan, which has been 
watching his two-day visit closely fearing Washington may give 
something new away to China in return for Beijing's support for 
the US-led war on terrorism, analysts said.

The democratic island run by President Chen Shui-bian of the 
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party relies on the 
United States as its main arms supplier and trading partner.
Washington angered Beijing last year by offering Taiwan the 
biggest arms package in a decade -- including submarines for the 
first time -- and saying Washington would do "whatever it takes" 
to protect the island.
China had demanded that Washington end arms sales to Taiwan and 
step back from explicit statements of support for the island, 
which Beijing has threatened to attack if it declares 
independence or delays reunification talks indefinitely.
