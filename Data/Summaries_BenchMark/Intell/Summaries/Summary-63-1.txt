BULGARIA : Bulgaria to float state firms on revived bourse .
Bulgaria's industry ministry , facing a mammoth task in restructuring 1,150 state firms , hopes to float some companies on a revived stock exchange to make privatisation more transparent and attract foreign investors .

"_ Domestic buyers in the market are not that many and our hope was that if we float say 10 to 20 percent of a certain number of big state companies on the stock exchange we will find institutional investors from the West , _" Marinov said .
He told Reuters in an interview the cash generated by such investment would go back into the companies instead_of into the state budget as with direct privatisations .
Marinov said that of the 1,150 enterprises controlled by his ministry , 845 made a profit last financial year and the rest made a loss .

Marinov said floating the companies would make the privatisation process more transparent as potential investors would have open access to financial data .
Bulgaria's mass privatisation programme has issued eight billion levs of stock but at present there is no clear procedure for trading it .

Privatisation is a key part of Bulgaria's commitments to the IMF and World Bank , and will generate foreign currency badly needed to support a fixed exchange rate system due_to be introduced in June .
The former Socialist government officially abolished direct subsidies to loss-makers but tried to keep the firms going through payouts from state-owned commercial banks , several of which are now in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings .
General elections are due on April 19 but the industry ministry team expects to stay on under the new government and continue its work .
