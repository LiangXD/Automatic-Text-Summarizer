More Drivers Texting at Wheel Despite State Bans, Study Finds
Last month, Pennsylvania became the 35th state to forbid texting while driving.

While electronic gadgets are in ever greater use by drivers, motorists are deeply conflicted about it, a NHTSA survey of over 6,000 drivers found.
More than half of drivers said making a cellphone call made no difference to their driving performance, and a quarter said texting or emailing made no difference.
Big majorities of drivers surveyed support bans on hand-held cellphone use and texting while driving -- 71 percent and 94 percent, respectively.

About twice as many drivers reported answering incoming calls as making calls while driving, 71 percent to 41 percent.
And more drivers reported reading than sending texts or emails.

There were very few situations in which drivers said they would never talk on the phone or send texts.
Overall, 32,885 people died in traffic crashes in the United States in 2010, a nearly 3 percent drop and the lowest number since 1949.
Overall, motorcycle deaths have doubled since 1995.
