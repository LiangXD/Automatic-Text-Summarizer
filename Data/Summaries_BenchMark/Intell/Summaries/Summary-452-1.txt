Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and
      Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that
      comes with work.
Now I
      can buy a soda and spend money.

Because turning welfare recipients into tax payers just makes
      sense.
Coming to Goodwill
      was the first step toward my becoming totally independent.
I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow.

Each year, we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles.
A robust economy helps by
      providing job opportunities, but to be honest, most of the people who
      aren't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest
      obstacles.

Last year, Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their
      self-sufficiency.
Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support
      services that will help even more find jobs.
Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs.
