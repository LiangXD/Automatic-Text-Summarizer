US President George W. Bush presented 14 February his alternative plan to the Kyoto Protocol, which is designed to slow down global warming.
But environmentalists immediately attacked this US proposal.

Carl Pope, the director of the Sierra Club, one of the major US environmental protection associations, does not mince his words when describing the US plan to replace the Kyoto Protocol.
Contrary to the preceding one, the plan proposed by Washington Thursday no longer has any binding procedure and is based on voluntary measures and tax incentives.
It advocates a voluntarist approach to the fight against global warming by directly linking the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction to US economic growth.

The aim is to lower polluting emissions from 183 tonnes per million dollars of GDP to 151 tonnes in 2012.
The US President asserted his determination to win developing countries over to his plan, stating that the US approach would give them a "yardstick for progress on climate changes which recognizes their right to economic development."

"Developing nations such as China and India already account for a majority of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.
As far as the US Administration is concerned, this approach will make it posible to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere while sustaining the economic growth needed to finance our investments in a new, cleaner energy structure."
Carl Pope, the director of the Sierra Club, considers for his part that the Bush Administration "is sticking to the polluting policies that the energy industry asked for rather than taking the sensible steps that can protect our health."
