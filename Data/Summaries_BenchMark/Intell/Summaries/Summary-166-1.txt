" the government must finally see the Argentine government, and the social explosion that has befallen Argentina.

Yesterday, Argentina as well was being portrayed as if everything there were going fine.
Noting that a temporary golden age had been experienced in Argentina, Hatiboglu said that "The IMF knows very well how to calculate just when it will deliver the actual death blow.
It delivered that blow, and hit Argentina.

Yasin Hatiboglu also criticized the implementation of the program wherein classical Turkish 'divan' literature will not be taught in schools, and that, instead, pre-Republic and post-Republic literature will be taught.

Responding to a question, Yasin Hatiboglu asserted that the [controversial] 2002 calendar had not been prepared by the SP itself, but rather that the calendar that has made news had been composed by a private firm.
ANKARA (A.A) - 21.12.2001 - Yasin Hatiboglu, Deputy Chairman of the SP [Felicity Party]'s Parliamentary Group, claiming that countries in which the programs of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] are implemented experience the same fate, has said that the government must see the social explosion that has occurred in Argentina.
Hatiboglu began a press conference he held at the TBMM [Turkish Grand National Assembly] by saying that "I hope that Mr. [State Minister for the Economy Kemal] Dervis will not have the same fate as [former Argentine Economics Minister Domingo] Cavallo, and that our country's fate will not be the same as Argentina's."
