Jurong , SembCorp finalise merger .
The two companies also revealed changes to their merger proposal , first announced in November .

Under the revised proposal , SembCorp will inject only its shipyard businesses , excluding some parts like its loss-making offshore engineering operations .
The offshore engineering assets were excluded because SembCorp's strategy and focus were different from Jurong's , a joint statement said .
The merger , which needs the approval of shareholders and the Stock Exchange of Singapore , is expected to be sealed by the third quarter of 1997 , company officials said .

The merger will result in SembCorp's stake in Jurong rising to 38.6 percent from 23.4 percent and will trigger a mandatory general offer for the rest of Jurong shares .
Yeo said the company was looking to grow internationally and might bring in a third party as it progresses .

On market concerns that Jurong was getting the raw end of the deal by receiving additional yard capacity during a marine industry slowdown , Lua said : "_ We recognised the cyclical nature of the industry .
The proposed merger offers opportunity to reorganise ourselves and helps rationalise the industry .
SembCorp shares were likely to come under pressure as their loss-making divisions remained intact , the analysts said .
