ONE IN 50 Britons suffers from sugar diabetes and , despite 100 years of scientific study , we still do not know how it is caused .
	
    Normal individuals maintain the concentration of blood sugar at a constant level by their own insulin , which causes cells in muscle , liver and fatty tissue ?
	

    target cells ?
	

    to take up excess circulating sugar and store it .
	

    The diabetic is unable to regulate sugar in this way .
	

    In theory there are two distinct versions of the disease .
 When insulin was isolated at the Toronto Medical School in 1922 , a far-sighted decision by an executive of the Eli Lilly Company ensured the dominance of his firm in commercial production .

    With astonishing speed , in the era before regulation of new drugs , Lilly developed systems for extracting pork and beef insulin from slaughterhouse offal .
	
    Effective therapy has therefore been available for more than 60 years .
	



    In the 1970s , genetic engineering made it possible to clone human insulin genes in micro-organisms which secreted insulin with the same structure as natural human material .
    Three papers published recently in Science move us a_little closer to understanding the basis of the disease , which turns out to be highly complex .
  Two of the papers in Science came from Japan and reported on individuals suffering from Type A syndrome , a rare variant of Type 2 diabetes .

    The third paper , from the US , reports work with rats given diabetes experimentally with the drug streptozotocin .


   Working out the whole story will be a long , difficult process of unravelling the pathways of insulin action in cells .

 In the long run the technological hare may be outrun by the investigative tortoise .
