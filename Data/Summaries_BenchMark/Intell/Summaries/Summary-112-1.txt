China's minister in charge of Taiwan affairs says Beijing will not resort to force to defend Taiwan despite the changing situation on the island, which he described as "our renegade province".
Wang Yi, who made a three-day working visit to Thailand last week, sought to allay fears amongst allies in Asia about its cross-straits ties with Taiwan.

"Weapons cannot prevent Taiwan from reuniting with China," he told Thai and Chinese media last week.
President Lee Teng-hui demanded political parity by unilaterally redefining bilateral ties as "special state-to-state" relations.
In his latest speech, Chen said the long-standing dispute with China must be resolved through dialogue with respect to the principles of democracy and freedom.

Beijing was so worried about the tactic that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji raised the matter in May with Thai leaders during his official visit to Thailand.
"We disapproved of these visits because no matter in what capacity these people travel, Taiwan treats them as official visits.

Wang said Beijing raised no objections to the so-called stop-over tactic used by Taiwanese leaders as long as the visits do not generate political activities in the host country.
He said the decline in President Chen's popularity could be attributed to the drop in the number of people favouring independence.
Wang believes unification will benefit people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
