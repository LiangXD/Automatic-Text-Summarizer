    Sunday's deadly grenade attack has sent jitters though Cambodia's business community and could stall new foreign investment for months , analysts said on Monday .
	

    "_ Our economy is so fragile now , this is the last thing we needed , _" said Tep Rithivit , a Cambodian-Canadian business consultant whose firm represents foreign corporations here .
	

    "_ Everyone is very concerned it will have long-term repercussions .
	

    We_ 're worried the story may not stop here . _"
	

    At_least 14 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the attack on opposition demonstrators in front of the National Assembly .
    For many investors , the attack was a reminder that four years into democratic and economic reforms , Cambodia remains a risky place to do business .
    Security and political instability , exacerbated by the rivalry of co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen , compound the challenges of an incomplete commercial code , corruption and war-scarred infrastructure , analysts said .
	
    Political strains have already led to the annulment of three contracts with the country's largest investor , Ariston Sdn Bhd of Malaysia .
	
    Some analysts said it could take months to know the full damage to Cambodia , which is anxious to lure business to rebuild a economy with a per_capita gross domestic product of less than $300 a year .
