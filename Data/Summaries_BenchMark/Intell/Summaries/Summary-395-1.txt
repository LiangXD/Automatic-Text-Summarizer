The bleeding hearts claim we're brutalizing the captives by forcing them to wear orange jumpsuits, sleep on mats, exercise daily, shower frequently and eat special food.
This time around, they've already bitten 
one of the soldiers guarding them and threatened to kill anybody 
else who gets too close.

Terrorists dressed to pass like 
these were often shot right on the spot during World War II and 
the Korean War.
I'm personally offended that none of the whistle-blowers seems 
to give a damn about the welfare or safety of our sons and 
daughters guarding these thugs.
Had anyone checked, they would have discovered that our U.S. 
Army Military Police guarding the terrorists think the prisoners 
are being treated a lot better than they are.

They're not 
pleased that the brass, the lawmakers and the press are more 
interested in the well-being of the detainees than the soldiers 
guarding them, and that they might as well be invisible.
Our officers are more concerned with doing 
Pentagon damage control concerning the detainees than looking 
after the troops."

They get four 
hot meals a day, fresh fruit, regular issues of snacks such as 
sunflower seeds, regular clean clothes laundered by the Marine 
supply system," says another soldier. "
"The Marine general says we can have a beer when off duty, but our Army leadership is running so scared that it set a no-drinking policy," says another troop.
Maybe someday, do-gooders, editors, lawmakers and senior Army 
leaders will remember our soldiers are human beings with human 
rights, too, and get their side of the story.
