Mugabe won polls unfairly says West
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, easily beaten by the 
veteran president according to official results, said Mugabe had 
stolen the vote through violence and intimidation and by 
preventing hundreds of thousands of people from voting.

Zimbabwe had 
ignored its commitment to a free and fair poll.
Two State Department officials said Washington aimed to impose 
financial restrictions against any assets in the US held by 
Mugabe and senior members of his government but could not say 
when they would take effect.
A deep split appeared between Western nations and African 
countries monitoring the vote, who closed ranks behind Mugabe, 
calling the election legitimate.

Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede declared Mugabe the winner 
after results were in from all 120 constituencies.
South Africa and Nigeria together with Australia comprise a 
special Commonwealth group given the power to take measures 
against Zimbabwe if the election is deemed not to have been free 
and fair.

Several hundred Mugabe supporters danced in celebration and 
carried mock coffins for Tsvangirai in two Harare townships.
Information Minister Jonathan Moyo said the result was a blow to 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair whom Mugabe accuses of 
sponsoring Tsvangirai.
The former colonial power Britain said that Mugabe had held on 
to power through a "systematic campaign of violence and 
intimidation".
