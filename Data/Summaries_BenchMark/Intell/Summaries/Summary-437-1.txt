In the summer of 1993, the Marion County Commission on Youth began
      what can best be described as a "new era" in its history.
MCCOY was
      reorganized as an independent, not-for-profit agency, separate from local
      government.

For the past three years, MCCOY has been actively engaged in
      accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others:
      youth service providers, youth, funding bodies, and interested citizens
      to name a few.
A Providers Council and a Youth Coalition
      are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the
      years to come.
The formation of The Community Academy, a pilot project
      directed at expelled students from local school systems, has come about
      as a result of MCCOY's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response
      to a pressing issue.

McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community
      collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the
      inclusion of young people in both decision-making and program planning
      processes.
As a team, these three organizations are working with
      neighborhood youth and adults to build a "Caring Neighborhood with Youth"
      , mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a
      better neighborhood for all.

In the last several years, the business and corporate community has
      recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to
      the development of a competent workforce.
In our fund raising efforts to date, we have received the support of
      local government, foundations, and corporations as well as the personal
      financial commitments of individual MCCOY Board members.
We believe there
      is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative
      effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community
      as a whole.
