Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job.
His most
      recent job lasted only a year before cut-backs eliminated his
      position.

For 18 long months Michael could not find a job.
At Goodwill, Michael's counselors felt that his personable demeanor
      could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match
      where his people skills could shine.
After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person
      for the job.

At last, he has found success in a job that he loves.
Every year, thousands of people come to Goodwill.

Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public
      support and more paying taxes.
Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three-quarters of
      a million dollars in public assistance.
For every dollar of public
      support Goodwill received last year, we returned $1.59 to the community
      in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments.
