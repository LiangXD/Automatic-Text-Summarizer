Kuchma was referring to plans by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko to sign a bilateral Union Treaty in Moscow on Wednesday .
Yeltsin on Monday approved the draft of the treaty despite liberals' fears that he might be signing away some of his powers to authoritarian Lukashenko .

Ukraine , whose referendum on independence in December 1991 heralded the end of the Soviet Union , is generally sceptical about the re-integration of ex-Soviet states and aims for integration with European structures .
Kuchma was the first foreign leader to meet Lukashenko after a controversial constitutional referendum in Belarus last November which gave the Minsk leader sweeping powers .
The Ukrainian leader , usually hesitant to criticise Lukashenko , said he did not support some of the Belarus leader's actions such as his recent crackdowns on the mass media .

One Russian television correspondent had his accreditation withdrawn and was ordered to leave Belarus by March 31 .
Kuchma also praised a CIS summit in Moscow last week as the first one to take Kiev's interests into account .

Kuchma , who met Yeltsin on Saturday after the CIS summit , confirmed the Kremlin leader would visit Kiev , a trip that has been postponed at_least six times .
But he added that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would come to Kiev before Yeltsin to discuss economic issues .
Ukraine holds observer status in the CIS , despite being one of its co-founders .
