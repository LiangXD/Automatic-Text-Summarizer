The Kimberley Provincial Hospital said it would probably know by Tuesday whether one of its patients had Congo Fever.
A set of tests specifically for Congo fever were still outstanding.

The woman was admitted to the hospital on Saturday after complaining of severe joint pains.
The patient told hospital authorities she became sick after being bitten by a tick about four months ago.
By afternoon she was conversing with her husband after being semi-comatose in the morning.

Between one and 10 cases of Congo Fever are reported in South Africa annually, with about 20 to 25 percent of patients dying, according to statistics from the virology institute.
A total of 158 cases of Congo Fever were diagnosed in southern Africa between 1981 and the end of 2000.

Early symptoms of the disease include severe headaches, red eyes, fevers and cold chills, body pain, and vomiting.
The disease can be contracted if a person is bitten by a certain tick or if a person comes into contact with the blood of a Congo Fever sufferer.
