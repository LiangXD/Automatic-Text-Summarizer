Tuesday announced $380 million in new investments for South America , including assembly plants for pickup trucks and diesel engines in Brazil and the expansion of a Jeep plant now being built in Argentina .
Eaton said the investments will boost Chrysler's sales in the Mercosur free-trade zone , which groups Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay .

But the company's limited production capacity will allow it only to grab a small portion of the Mercosur market away from rivals General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG , he said .
In Argentina , Chrysler said it will add production of about 6,000 Jeep Cherokees a year at a plant now under construction in the Cordoba province .
The plant is already scheduled to build about 14,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees per year starting next April , and Cherokee output will begin in 1998 .

A site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll off the assembly line starting in mid-1998 , Chrysler said .
The $315 million Brazil investment also includes a new diesel engine plant to be built by Detroit Diesel Corp. .

The $10 million facility will supply the company's Italian-designed VM Motori four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines for use in the Brazilian Dakota as_well_as in Jeep models built in Argentina .
Chrysler installs about 40,000 of the engines annually into minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold in Europe .
Chrysler stock rose 25 cents to close at $28.875 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange .
