Bush Takes Great Leap Forward In Pledging U.S. Help In Defending Taiwan
In a closed-door meeting in Florida last week, the Bush 
administration took a great leap forward in its declared policy 
that Taiwan remain separate from China so long as the people of 
Taiwan wish, even if that requires U.S. military force.

The senior U.S. official at the gathering was Deputy Secretary 
of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who has written: "It would be a 
strategic as well as a moral mistake for the United States to 
ever let China use force to have its way with Taiwan."
Tang asserted that Taiwan would do no such thing.
Bush began enunciating his policy on Taiwan in November 1999, 
saying that he would honor "our promises to the people of 
Taiwan" and "we deny the right of Beijing to impose their rule 
on a free people.

said that if China attacked Taiwan, "the United States will 
respond appropriately in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
The TRA, adopted after Carter broke relations with Taiwan, 
commits the United States to provide defensive arms to Taiwan 
and to view a threat from China with "grave concern."

Bush has 
repeatedly referred to the TRA in a not-so-subtle message to 
China that the law is the bedrock of his posture on Taiwan.
The most succinct statement of the Bush policy came from
Shortly after Bush took office, he approved the largest U.S. 
arms sale to Taiwan, allowing Taiwan to buy four destroyers, 
eight diesel-powered submarines, 12 anti-submarine aircraft and 
a flock of missiles and other weapons.
