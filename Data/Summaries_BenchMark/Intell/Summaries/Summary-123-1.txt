Dr. Ren Guoyu, an expert meteorologist at the National Climate Center of China, pointed out that the Kyoto Protocol was only the first step to resolve global warming during his interview with Xinhua News Agency.
This excessive emission of greenhouse gases has caused the mean global temperature to rise by 0.4 to 0.8 degree C in the past 140 years.

If emission of greenhouse gases is not rigorously limited and is allowed to continue to climb, then the average global temperature may surge by 1.5 to 5.8 C. The sea level will rise by nine to 88 millimeters.
The disaster can only be averted if we all join in to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to stop global warming.
The amount of greenhouse gases emitted by most developing nations in the past several decades only represents a small fraction of the total emission.

The increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by industrialized nations.
To implement the Kyoto Protocol, according to Dr. Ren, usually a country would incur an economic loss equivalent to 1 percent of its GDP when it tries to lower greenhouse emissions 1 percent.

A compromise was reached after developing nations and the EU made a significant concession.
As a reminder, Dr. Ren pointed out: The Kyoto Protocol is merely a gesture for mankind to stop global warming.
The Kyoto Protocol will officially be implemented after Earth Summit 2002 to be held in September in Johannesburg, South Africa.
