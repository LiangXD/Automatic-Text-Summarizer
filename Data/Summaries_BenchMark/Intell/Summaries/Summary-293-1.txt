Violent protests in Argentina; president Duhalde calls for calm
BUENOS AIRES - President Eduardo Duhalde yesterday pleaded for 
patience as he works on the country's economic crisis.

Duhalde, who took office on January 2 as Argentina's fifth 
president in a month, vowed his government would unveil a new 
economic program to rescue the country from four years of 
recession.
Daily protests have engulfed Argentina: Popular rage has boiled 
over against Duhalde's decision to devalue the peso by more than 
30 percent and further tighten a banking freeze that has locked 
most Argentines' savings into bank accounts.
Late Friday night, Argentines' impatience peaked, and Duhalde 
faced the second and most widespread protest since he assumed 
the presidency after similar protests forced his predecessors 
from office.

Under a driving rain, more than 10,000 Argentines 
banged pots and pans in the Plaza de Mayo to protest the banking 
freeze, shouting insults at the country's political leaders, the
Supreme Court, and banks - all of whom the Argentines blame for 
plunging the country into its worst economic crisis in decades.

The protest marked the first 
organized protest, led by labor and neighborhood groups who also 
called for the protest via e-mail and the Internet.
But what 
began as a peaceful protest in downtown Buenos Aires, later 
turned violent as riot police riding on motorcycles used tear 
gas and rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of peaceful 
demonstrators.
Demonstrators lingered in the streets for hours early yesterday 
before crowds began melting away before dawn. "
