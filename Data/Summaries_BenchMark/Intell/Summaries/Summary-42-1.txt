    But analysts and bankers said the convenience financial firms now find in the quasi-fixed overnight money may sooner of later be replaced by risk .

    The BOJ also needs to encourage the financial institutions to reduce their reliance on overnight money prior_to its introduction of the "_ real-time gross settlement _" ( RTGS ) system , they said .
    The central bank has since December gathered ideas from the financial institutions based in Tokyo on the RTGS system , in which transactions are settled instantly on a real-time basis through the accounts that they have at the BOJ .

    The BOJ has said the financial firms' efforts to reduce reliance on overnight call money and do more longer-term transactions is necessary for an introduction of the RTGS .
	

    The current system in which transactions are settled at four specific points within a day is efficient as long as there is no bank failure .
