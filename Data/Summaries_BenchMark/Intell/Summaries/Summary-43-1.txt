    Japan's beleaguered banks got a break on Monday when the stock market ended the financial year above a key level , helping them avoid losses on their large share portfolios from pushing them into the red .
    Some market watchers said government-backed money appeared to be behind the scenes in helping the late market rally .

    The close on Monday was hardly great news for Japan , representing a fall of 16 percent from the beginning of the fiscal year .

    Posting losses cuts a bank's capital cushion and reduces capital adequacy ratios set by the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) , further undermining the already-tainted credibility of Japanese banks .

    Analysts said the top 20 banks would stick to their plans to dispose of about 5.0 trillion yen ( $40.3 billion ) worth of problem loans for 1996/97 despite the appraisal losses .
    Yukiko Ohara , analyst at UBS Securities Ltd , said she expects some big banks to unveil drastic problem loan disposal plans in 1997/98 as Japan will introduce new capital adequacy standards , known as the prompt corrective action ( PCA ) system , in April next year .
    Under the new system , banks are strictly required to set aside loan-loss provisions in line with global accounting standards .
