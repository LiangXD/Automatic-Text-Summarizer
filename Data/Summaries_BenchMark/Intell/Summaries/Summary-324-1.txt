Governments are expected to 
protect the national economy, and they should deviate from that 
mission only when crucial national interests are at stake 
(fighting terrorism, for example).
Rising temperatures pose little threat to Canada.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identified several 
threats to Canadian ecosystems, but concluded that our farmers 
would generally benefit from warmer temperatures.
(Non-farming 
Canadians, most of whom spend at least part of the winter months 
scraping ice off their cars, chopping firewood and shovelling 
their walks, will profit as well.)
As for the globally felt benefits that would follow from 
Canada's implementation of the Kyoto protocol, they are slight.

Even if Canada managed to convince the United States and every 
other Kyoto signatory to ratify the protocol, world carbon 
dioxide emissions would still soar.
Information Administration, world energy consumption will 
increase by about 60% between now and 2020, with most of the 
upsurge expected to come from developing nations, which are not 
covered by the Kyoto Protocol.

There are better ways to spend the money.
Instead of trying to 
cap carbon dioxide emissions -- a costly burden at home and an 
impossible task in the developing world -- we should focus on 
abating the damage global warming does in at-risk nations.
World nations plant new crops, vaccinate people and relocate 
coastal towns will be costly, the bottom line will likely be 
only a fraction of Kyoto's 13-digit price tag.
