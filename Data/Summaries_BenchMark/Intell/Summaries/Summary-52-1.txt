Washington, DC: Avaulta mesh is but one player in a women's health issue that, to some in the legal profession, represent a particularly alarming portfolio that sees many patients no longer existing as the women they once were.
Lawsuits involving the Bard Avaulta mesh implant have been consolidated in federal court in the Southern District of West Virginia.

The agency appears unwilling to formally revoke approval of the mesh products, including Bard Avaulta mesh, for that indication.
TVM mesh grew out of a similar surgical mesh used successfully for decades to treat hernias.
Among them: erosion of the mesh into the vagina causing pain, infection and in some cases injury to the woman's partner.

For some patients, the mesh has affected intimacy with a spouse or partner.
Some patients have suffered perforations of the bladder.

With some patients for whom the Avaulta pelvic mesh was intended to resolve incontinence problems, symptoms of incontinence persisted.
Some patients undergo revision surgery.
While TVM lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court and will be handled by Chief Judge Joseph R. Goodwin, many an Avaulta lawsuit has been filed in state courts.
