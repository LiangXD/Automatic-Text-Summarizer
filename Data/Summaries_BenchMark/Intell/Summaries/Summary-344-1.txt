HARARE, Zimbabwe - President Robert Mugabe was sworn in Sunday 
for his fifth term in office following a bitterly fought 
election that the opposition and many Western governments 
denounced as rigged.
Speaking publicly for the first time since government election 
officials declared him the winner four days ago, Mugabe returned 
to the themes he struck during his campaign against Morgan 
Tsvangirai, a former trade union leader.

Mugabe is a former rebel leader who led this country to 
independence from Britain 22 years ago.
He told an audience 
assembled in the colonial-style State House mansion that his 
victory was a triumph against the West and whites who he said 
had aligned against him and his governing party, the Zimbabwe
Several African heads of states attended the ceremony, including 
President Sam Nujoma of Namibia and President Joseph Kabila of 
the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Mugabe, 78, remained defiant, blaming racism for the criticism 
and pledging to accelerate his land-reform program, under which 
the country's most fertile land has been seized from white 
commercial farmers for redistribution to poor, landless blacks.

The takeovers and occupations of farms, lack of transparency and 
political violence have led many international donors to cut 
funding to Zimbabwe, which is in the fourth year of a recession 
and a worsening food shortage.
Mugabe appealed to the nation and the opposition to reconcile to 
address the pressing economic needs, but fell short of proposing 
a government of national unity.
Africa is not intent on revitalizing its economies through good 
government and expanded international trade.
