The United States and China may not be on the verge of a breakthrough in often testy ties , but both sides can claim gains from visits by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich , analysts said on Monday .
Gore reassured the Chinese that Washington remained committed to an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin , telling reporters that officials from both countries were working on specific dates .

While the speaker of the House of Representatives had somewhat tougher talk in public for his Chinese hosts , pointedly referring to Beijing's policies on human rights and Taiwan , the content was not unexpected .
More importantly for China's leaders , the visit by the key Republican and other members of a bipartisan congressional delegation presented an opportunity for Beijing to make a personal pitch on major issues such as Taiwan .
Jiang used his meeting with Gingrich on Friday to note how pleased he was that more congressmen were visiting China to see first hand the importance of the Taiwan issue to Beijing .

The United States recognises China but has strong commercial and other unofficial ties with the island that Beijing views as a renegade province .
The administration assured Beijing that no visit would be permitted but the trip was allowed to proceed under pressure from Congress .

Both Washington and Beijing struggled to ensure that accusations of illegal Chinese funding for the Democratic Party did not overshadow the Gore visit .
Gore reassured Beijing that unless there was firm evidence of illegal payments , the issue would not affect U.S. policy .
American figures put the U.S. trade deficit with China at about $40 billion last year , and Washington has been pushing for greater access to the China market to narrow the gap .
