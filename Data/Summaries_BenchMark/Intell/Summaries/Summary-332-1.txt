BUENOS AIRES - Veteran Peronist Adolfo Rodriguez Saa was set to 
become the country's interim president yesterday, taking power 
after a devastating economic crisis toppled President Fernando 
de la Rua.
De la Rua was brought down after violent 
protests against his economic steps left 27 people dead and more 
than 200 people injured.

The leader 
elected then will finish out the two years of de la Rua's term.
A populist who has ruled a western arid province for 18 years, 
Rodriguez Saa will have to deal with an economy on the brink of 
defaulting on its $132 billion public debt and struggling with 
more than 18 percent unemployment.
Rodriguez Saa yesterday told the television network Todo 
Noticias he would announce an economic plan to ease the crisis.

Polls indicate that a majority of Argentines support keeping the 
peg in place, despite increased calls from many economists and 
several political leaders that only a devaluation can help the 
economy rebound.
said Pablo Arteaga, a 
36-year-old dentist whose wife is a state worker whose salary 
has fallen by 13 percent in recent months. "

De la Rua resigned Thursday, following two days of protests, 
food riots and supermarket looting.
Rodriguez Saa is reportedly considering easing banking 
restrictions imposed by De la Rua, limiting to $1,000 the amount 
of money Argentines can withdraw from their accounts.
A run on 
the banks had threatened a devaluation of the peso.
