Leaders of the United States probably withheld their breath Monday evening while watching on television what Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to say to his people.
The military great power that towers over Afghanistan has committed itself to overthrow the ruling Taliban system, and has pledged to support the US "anti-terrorism military operation" now being prepared.

Putin has exceeded the "positive neutrality policy" his country (the Soviet Union at the time) has pursued during the Gulf War, and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable.
And Putin has established the prospect of taking further steps .
Russia has joined the anti-terrorist coalition of the United States virtually without reservation.

Putin has written the name of Moscow on the registration page of the American side.
Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of "international terror."

In reality, Putin asked for a free hand regarding Chechnia, some understanding, or even that the Americans look the other way.
Putin did not receive what he sought in a quick response from Washington, namely, that the State Department would continue to encourage political dialogue between Moscow and the Chechen insurgents.
The Russian President has understood this American recognition.
