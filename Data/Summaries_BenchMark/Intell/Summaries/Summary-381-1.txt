The election the week in Zimbabwe was an ugly travesty from which all of southern Africa will suffer.
Voters lined up for 
hours at polling stations, many of them in vain.

International observers called 
the process deeply flawed, and the Bush administration has 
refused to recognize the declared results.
Some leading African countries like South Africa and Nigeria have compounded the problem by accepting Mugabe's victory despite earlier assertions that they would not recognize the results of a rigged election.
By failing to hold firm they 
not only damage their diplomatic credibility, but also ignore 
the consequences for nearby African states of Mugabe's misrule.

Washington and 
other Western governments may now strengthen the current mild 
sanctions against Zimbabwe.
Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe's liberation struggle against white 
minority rule in the late 1970's, has systematically wrecked his 
country's economy and its freedoms to prolong his 22-year-old 
hold on power.

The picture changed radically in the mid-1990's when Mugabe shifted onto a highly destructive course.
The campaign has been carried out with help from a small but loyal core of former liberation fighters turned thugs.
Thugs and fraud cannot 
keep the 78-year-old Mugabe in power forever.
