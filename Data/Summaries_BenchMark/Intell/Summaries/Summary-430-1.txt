Last week, when the Lewinsky story was only
a few hours old, Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America to
demonstrate his concern. "
These are probably the most serious allegations leveled against the president.

By
lending credence to the Lewinsky charges, and treating Clinton's familiar
defenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, Stephanopoulos shows he's
not a fool.
Simply put, Stephanopoulos did as much as any
man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments.
The 1993 documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts on
tape.

Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours, which he is about to publicize.
You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection
techniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to
not get caught.

When Democrats
wonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton, they don't need to look much
further than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos, Carville (and
a cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992.
Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going
through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the
country.
If Clinton, as is now increasingly clear, was a time bomb waiting to
explode, then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House and
muffled the ticking.
