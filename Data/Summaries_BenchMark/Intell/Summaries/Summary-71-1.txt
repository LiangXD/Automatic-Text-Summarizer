Vlore , once Albania's bustling second port , is now a violent wasteland with the recently installed rebel Committee for Public Salvation struggling to keep the place afloat .
An Italian-led multinational security force is due_to be deployed in Vlore in the coming weeks to protect humanitarian supplies destined for its port .

Vlore spearheaded a nationwide revolt against President Sali Berisha after a string of fraudulent investment schemes failed in January , wiping out millions of dollars in savings .
Residents of the port , where Albania declared independence from Ottoman rule in 1912 , rioted against Berisha in February , stripping police and expelling them from the town .
The ornate town hall was also sacked and burned by rioters in February so the rebel council meets in the Ali Demi High School , named after a World War Two resistance hero .

While Laluci talks a rowdy argument among several people can be heard in a classroom .
The rest of the rebel council is debating a new mayor and regional prefect .

Residents blame Berisha for their fate , which forced more than 13,000 Albanians to flee to Italy in unsafe boats in March alone .
The popularity of the Italian-led security force suffered a setback after a crowded refugee boat from Vlore collided with an Italian navy ship last week and sank .
Few people in Vlore are so positive about the plan .
