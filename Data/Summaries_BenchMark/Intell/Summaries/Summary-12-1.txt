Consumer Reports magazine slapped a "_ Not Acceptable _" label on two sport/utility vehicles Tuesday , saying the light trucks "_ have too great a tendency to roll over in certain situations . _"

The magazine said the 1995 and 1996 models of the Isuzu Trooper , made by Isuzu Motors Ltd. , and the 1996 Acura SLX , also made by Isuzu but sold by Honda Motor Co. Ltd. , were a danger to consumers because they "_ tipped up high on two wheels _" in road tests . 

 The magazine said consumers should stop buying the models , called for an immediate recall of the approximately 35,000 cars that have been sold and said repairs or replacement models should be offered by the manufacturer . 

 Consumer Reports also asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate the Trooper and SLX and called for more stringent government oversight of vehicles with narrow wheelbases .

 Government regulations currently call for all vehicles with a wheel base of 110 inches or less to carry a warning sticker stating that "_ sharp turns or abrupt manoeuvres _" may cause the vehicle to roll over or crash .
