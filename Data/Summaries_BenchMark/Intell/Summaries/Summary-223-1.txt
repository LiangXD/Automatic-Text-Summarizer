It is clear that the proposals for US action on climate change are domestic.
The "intensity target" proposed allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change.

The Kyoto Protocol requires most industrialised countries to achieve absolute emission reductions, while they still foresee to have growing economies.
The Climate Change Convention of 1992, to which the US is a Party, requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels.
The new plan does not lead to such a stabilisation, but instead will lead to the increase of absolute emission levels.

Current emission projections for the US indicate an increase of 39% above 1990 levels in 2012.
The EU is of the opinion that a cap-and-trade system is a cost-effective measure to reduce emissions which combines a guaranteed environmental result with the flexibility to reduce emissions where it is least costly.

The EU welcomes the fact that the Bush administration has now completed its policy review and has put forward what the US intends to do in terms of domestic climate change policy.
The proposals by President Bush may represent a first step in the right direction, where also economic operators in the US are asked to contribute to emission control.
The EU will continue on its current path of emission reduction and is optimistic that other major players, notably Japan and Russia, will join us in these efforts.
