A container from the Swedish nuclear technology firm Studsvik has leaked radioactive materials.
The Swedish and US authorities are looking for people who might have been exposed to dangerous radiation, but there is no indication that the container started to leak in Sweden.

According to all indications, the radioactive container sent from the nuclear technology firm Studsvik to the US did not leak during transport within Sweden.
When the container was transshipped in Paris, measurements showed no abnormal levels, according to the US Transport Department.
The container with the radioactive substance iridium 192 was transshipped at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris by the shipping company Federal Express.

The pilot who was supposed to fly the container to the US was equipped with a dosimeter, which measures radiation levels.
The US Transport Department has now informed Studsvik that the measurements done by Federal Express in Paris showed no abnormality.

Measurements done at Studsvik before dispatch had not shown high radiation values.
Yesterday [07 January], the National Institute of Radiation Protection (SSI) announced that it could not exclude the possibility of people who had come into contact with the container suffering acute health effects from radiation.
The SSI is now attempting to trace people who could have been exposed to the radiation leak.
