Commander of base sees a world of change
GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba -- What a difference a terrorist 
detention center makes.

It's gotten so busy around this once-sleepy Caribbean outpost 
that the man in charge may soon restore the stoplight that, 
until Navy downsizing in the 1990s, hung near the only McDonalds 
in all of Cuba.
Born in Brevard County, Buehn is a Navy pilot whose rank of 
captain equals an Army colonel.
But Buehn said 
the new mission has given residents -- both civilians and 
service members -- a sense of unity and purpose after the 
uncertainty of Sept. 11 left them sitting on the sidelines of 
the U.S. war on international terror.

Tensions got so hot in 1962 that the base slipped Navy wives and kids onto a cargo ship and evacuated them during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
But Buehn said the Cubans have not raised any formal objections 
to the base's latest mission.

Geographically the base is split by the bay, and united by a 
ferry service.
Most residents on the windward side -- among 
them, now, some 158 alleged terrorists flown in from
Were Washington to decide to maintain Guantanamo as an offshore 
terrorist detention center, Buehn said, he would propose 
building a maximum security facility on leeward side.
