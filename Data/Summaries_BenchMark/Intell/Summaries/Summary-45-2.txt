Indocement 1996 net seen above target .
Net profits posted by Indocement , a major Indonesian cement manufacturer , in 1996 are above market estimates and installation of additional production capacity in 1997 and 1998 should keep the company in good stead , analysts said .

PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa announced it booked a net profit of 551.49 billion rupiah in 1996 .
Partono said the company had instituted changes in its accounting system in 1996 which partially accounted for the above-expectation earnings .
Aside_from changes in the accounting method , he also said the stable growth of the company's food division at about 15 percent per year had contributed to earnings growth .

Partono said he expected Indocement's cement division to imrove its performance in 1997 and 1998 due_to additional capacity from two new plants in West Java and Kalimantan .
Partono said he expected Indocement to perform only in line with the broader market and not exceed it .

Partono said it was hard to make a fair valuation for Indocement because it could not be considered a pure cement stock or a pure food stock .
The Jakarta bourse was closed on Monday because it was the last day of the 1996/97 fiscal year and will reopen on Tuesday .
"_ If we break up the value of Indocement into two divisions , cement and food , the cement business is undervalued , _" he said .
