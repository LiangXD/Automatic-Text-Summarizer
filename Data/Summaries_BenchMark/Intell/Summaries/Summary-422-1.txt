From a power
        base in Anatolia, the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and
        set their sights on the Cyclades.
The Persians were defeated, and Athens duly
        punished the islands that had turned against it.

Although the islands saw little action, as the
        war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power.
The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean
        Islands, which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and
        trade.
The Aegean Islands played their part.

Greece took the opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories.
Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor, which became part of the new Turkish state.

Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the
        islands.
After the war, in 1949, the Dodecanese islands finally
        became part of the Greek nation.
The struggle bypassed
        most of the islands, although there was fierce fighting on Samos.
