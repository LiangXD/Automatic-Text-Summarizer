For 10 days, the second Belgian astronaut will get to the International Space Station [ISS] on board the brand new Russian Soyuz TMA-1 space ship.
The formal agreement regarding Frank De Winne's flight with the Russians was signed in Brussels on Thursday by Charles Picque, the Minister for Science Policy, and his government commissioner Yvan Ylieff.

The document, a letter sent to both the ESA (European Space Agency, to which Frank De Winne currently reports) and the Russian Rosaviacosmos space agency, guaranteed the payment by Belgium of the expenses tied to this space trip.
On 4 November 2002, that is to say, in a little less than one year, the second Belgian to reach space will take off from the Baikonor cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on board a brand new Soyuz space ship: the TMA-1.
On it Frank De Winne will serve as the on-board engineer.

If that should prove necessary, De Winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship.
The sums obtained will result from the assignment of a portion of the space budget to this mission (and its many related scientific fall-outs) rather than to other optional programs.

About 10 years ago, Dirk Frimout was the first Belgian astronaut to go into earth orbit.
In a few weeks the second Belgian to go up there will don a Russian cosmonaut's space suit.
De Winne will qualify technically in space piloting.
