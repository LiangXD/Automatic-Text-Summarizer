One trader in Chicago said the low volume indicated the selloff may not be over .
The Dow slumped 140 points last Thursday .

A string of economic reports , including the key jobs report , which is scheduled for release Friday , was one factor keeping investors sidelined , but traders said last week's selloff also was a factor .
One broker in Chicago said some investors were attempting to play the OEX options , but wide spreads and stiff premiums made them difficult to trade .
Some analysts continued to look for some quarter-ending portfolio buying to emerge and support the market , but others noted that investor complacency appeared to be high , which is a bearish sign in a declining market .

Jerry Hegarty , an analyst at Thomson Financial Services , said in a report that by afternoon , OEX put buying topped call buying by only 6,000 contracts despite the market's drop .
By 1400 CST/2000 GMT , OEX call volume at the Chicago Board Options Exchange was 101,014 compared to put volume of 70,309 .

Hegarty said first-of-the-month buying may help the market recover Tuesday and Wednesday .
Although options trading indicated investor complacency , some indicators suggested bearishness was on the rise , which is bullish for contrarians .
He cited three sentiment indicators that all showed a notable drop in bullishness recently .
