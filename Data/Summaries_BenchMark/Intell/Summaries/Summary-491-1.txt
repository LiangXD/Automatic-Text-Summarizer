Circumstances have led to a situation where today the two parties in the conflict find themselves on the road that leads swiftly to the abyss.
On Thursday evening a Palestinian suicide bomber attacked a hotel in Natanya where a couple of hundred people had gathered for the traditional Passover meal.

As a first step Israeli forces were sent into the main Palestinian town, Ramallah, where Arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous Palestinian areas are administered.
Prior to the Natanya massacre Washington had imposed a number of limitations on Sharon.
Israeli's antiterrorist operations must not bring the Palestinian Authority to collapse, Israeli forces must not reconquer the territories under the jurisdiction of the authority, and Arafat the man must not be molested.

According to the sources, Sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while Arafat hesitated.
For the time being at least the United States has given Sharon a free hand.

The action that is currently taking place can at best only throw the terrorist groups off balance for a time.
The settlers, who number around 220,000 people, have taken the Israeli Government and both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples hostage.
The day the Israeli tanks again leave Ramallah they will have sown the seed for new terrorist actions.
