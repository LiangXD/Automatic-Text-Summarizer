It was the latest in an intimidating series of spots as the March 31 deadline arrived for Russians to file 1996 tax returns .
The campaign also has hair-raising footage of the heavily armed Tax Police in action $-- Kalashnikovs and tear gas grenades are in this year , brown suits and briefcases are out .

It seems to have worked , as more people filed returns .
But all the evidence points to evasion on a grand scale , leaving the cash-hungry government with a headache that will not go away .
That is good news for the government , which has made recovering taxes a priority after blaming persistent revenue shortfalls for the long delays in pensions and wages that sparked nationwide street protests last Thursday .

It still means millions of Russians , the vast majority are dodging their taxes .
But few Russians doubt nearly everyone fiddles the system .

And with just a dozen or so tax inspectors , the other 38,000 citizens have relatively little chance of being caught .

Public employees like teachers and doctors are still getting tax demands on salaries the state has failed to pay for months .
