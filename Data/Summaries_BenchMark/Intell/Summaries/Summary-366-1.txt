Pentagon officials said some prisoners might 
also be sedated during the more-than-20-hour flight, but it was 
not clear whether that had happened.
States did not consider the detainees prisoners of war, but that 
they were still being afforded the protections under the Geneva

Amnesty International issued a statement today saying that 
sedating prisoners or shackling them for an entire flight would 
violate international standards prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or 
degrading" treatment.
Mr. Rumsfeld said today that he did not know how the prisoners 
would be restrained during the flight.
No one was injured and the identify of the 
snipers remained unknown tonight, military officials said.

Military officials also said John Walker Lindh, the American who 
was captured with Taliban forces near Mazar-i-Sharif, was not 
among the prisoners transferred today.
Mr. Walker is still being 
held aboard the assault ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea, the 
officials said.

American forces in Afghanistan were holding a total of 371 
prisoners today, including 351 at Kandahar and 19 at Bagram air 
base north of Kabul.
Mr. Rumsfeld declined to discuss details about the growing 
American involvement in the Philippines, where Abu Sayyaf 
guerrillas have been battling government troops in the southern 
island of Basilan.
United States has sent an array of equipment to the Philippine 
military, including a C-130 cargo plane, 30,000 M-16 rifles and 
8 UH- 1 Huey helicopters.
