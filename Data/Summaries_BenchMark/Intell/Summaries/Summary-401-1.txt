US human rights report termed inaccurate
ISLAMABAD, March 5: The government on Tuesday rejected the US 
State Department Report on human rights as "factually inaccurate 
and unwarranted" adding that it reflected tendency of some 
states to sit in judgment on others.

It pointed out that all the goals set at an 
April 2000 human rights conference had been achieved, which it 
added had been ignored by the report.
The government, it added, has amended Pakistan Citizenship Act 
of 1951 to enable women of Pakistani descent to claim Pakistani 
nationality for their children born to foreign husbands.
A mass 
awareness campaign was launched as part of the observance of the

Year 2000 as the year of Human Rights and Human Dignity, it 
added.
It signed the Optional Protocols to Convention 
on the Rights of Child.

Recently the system of joint electorates 
has been introduced respecting the wishes of the minority 
communities, it said.
The government of Pakistan feels constrained to reject the assessment of the report about Pakistan, and the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others."
"The cause of human rights would be better served if all states, 
in a spirit of cooperation and understanding address the 
problems they face in promoting and protecting human rights," it 
said.
