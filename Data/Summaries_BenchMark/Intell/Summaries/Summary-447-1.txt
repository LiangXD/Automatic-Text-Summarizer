The holiday season is the time of year when we're all busy buying
      gifts, baking goodies, decorating our homes and making arrangements to be
      with family and friends.
This is the time of year when we give thanks for
      the warmth and love that surrounds us.

Pleasant Run cares for at-risk children and families.
Many of the children
      are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes.
Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a
      contribution to Pleasant Run to help the 1,500 children families we care
      for.

A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have
      presents to open.
A gift means a family will have a holiday meal, cooking
      utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on.

Your gift will go
      beyond the holiday season.
Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run.
Let our
      families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of
      memories of the holidays you will have.
