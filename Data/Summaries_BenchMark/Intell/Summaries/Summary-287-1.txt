Midweek: Wheel turns with a vengeance for the Taliban
Anxiety arises from the sense that the cultural gulf between these prisoners and their captors is so vast that the latter genuinely do not see how a diet of peanut butter and bagel chips can be considered cruel and inhuman punishment.

It might be doubly difficult for the Afghans among them ever to go back, if the new administration of their home country goes ahead with rebuilding the Buddhas of Bamiyan for their potential as a tourist attraction.
It's been almost a year since the Taliban blew up those 
monumental 1,500-year-old sandstone statues in northcentral
His clothes probably never looked quite like that - the 
statues' fashion sense had been clearly influenced by the

Greeks, what with Alexander the Great having passed through on 
his way to giving up with India.
The statues had been defaced long before they were finally reduced to rubble.

But the Taliban commander who aimed the RPG was ascribing human characteristics to a lump of stone.
Those poor bullet-scarred statues made everyone look sad and foolish, and their final immolation a year ago put them out of their misery, so to speak.
And so it has come ironically to pass that, one year on, a new 
Afghan order is dreaming of rebuilding those statues, while 
what's left of the Taliban now sits in cells a world away, 
beardless, bald and clad in saffron.
