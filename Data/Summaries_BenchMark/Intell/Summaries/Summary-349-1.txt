Forget space shuttles, orbiting telescopes, and more robotic 
rovers on Mars.
The next mission for NASA could be to steer soaring 
space-station costs back toward earth and restore credibility to 
what many call a dysfunctional space program.

The weekend, the agency bade farewell to administrator Daniel Goldin, who resigned after 10 years in office - an agency record.
In doing so, the White House is swapping the silver-visored 
helmet of a space cadet for the green eyeshade of a consummate 
bean counter.
Under Goldin, unmanned craft found evidence of water on the 
moon, inaugurated a long-term program to explore Mars, and 
opened the door to competition from the aerospace industry and 
universities to plan and execute missions.

But the agency's credibility has come under fire in manned 
spaceflight - especially the International Space Station, now 
completing its first year of full-time crews.
Early on, the Bush administration planned to scale back US 
involvement to a "core" station with a crew of three instead of 
six.

To cut the station's scope, they argue, violates 
international agreements and would essentially close off 
international use of the station.
In assessing how the agency might fare under O'Keefe, some 
analysts say it could blossom, as it did in its Apollo-program 
heyday under another numbers guy, James Webb.
