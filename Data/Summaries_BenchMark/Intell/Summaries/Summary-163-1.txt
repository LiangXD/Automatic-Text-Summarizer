A cargo ship intercepted in the Channel after a tip-off that it might be carrying terrorist materials was today given the all clear, police said.
The 450ft long vessel Nisha, carrying 26,000 tonnes [metric tons] of raw sugar, was stopped on Friday morning [21 December] amid fears it could be transporting noxious, hazardous or dangerous substances.

But after a detailed examination of the ship, which is currently moored off the Isle of Wight, nothing suspicious was found, police said.
The MV Nisha is operated by the Great Eastern Shipping Company, based in Bombay, India.
The ship had sailed from Mauritius and was carrying a cargo of sugar to the Tate &amp;amp; Lyle refinery on the Thames at Silvertown in east London, according to the company.

Mr Veness said the ship was now in a position to continue its journey, but completion of the voyage was still subject to consultation with all interested parties.
Mr Veness praised the crew and ship's owners for their co-operation and said: "We remain vigilant and are totally committed to ensuring the safety of the public.

The Nisha's cargo of raw sugar is owned by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, which had chartered the vessel, and the vessel was due to dock in east London yesterday.
The chairman of the British arm of the Great Eastern Shipping Company, Sudhir Mulji, confirmed that the vessel had stopped over at Djibouti before its current journey to drop off American grain as part of a food aid shipment.
The ship then went on to Mauritius to pick up the sugar and left on November 20 to transport it to Britain.
