Serbia has not chosen a future foreign partner in a planned privatisation of its post and telecommunications monopoly PTT Srbije , Minister for Economic and Ownership Transformation Milan Beko said on Monday .
According_to the new draft privatisation law , no international tenders will be invited for the sale of the PTT stake .

The government has already sent a basic information package to a large number of companies worldwide .
The minister said the estimated value of the PTT's entire capital was still not ready to go public , to protect the government's negotiating position .
But preliminary estimates prepared by the Belgrade-based private institute for economic research CES-Mecon valued the Serbian telecommunications unit at around $4 billion .

The government has appointed the NatWest Markets as the chief consultant and entrusted Pricewater House with preparing a detailed evaluation of the company .
The company sources said the division was planned for May .

Independent economists cautioned that in the absence of funds the government might use privatisation receipts to finance its massive public spending .
The minister could not specify when to expect the final decision on the sale , but hoped it would begin during 1997 .
Along_with the PTT , Serbia also intended to privatise its power industry EPS and oil industry NIS .
