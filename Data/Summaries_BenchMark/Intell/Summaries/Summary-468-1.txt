The Zionist and US administrations have the illusion that they succeeded in defeating the Palestinian people and their valiant intifadah.
They have also announced that President Yasir Arafat is no longer fit for the coming phase.

It is true that the Palestinian towns are now under occupation, that the Palestinian Authority's institutions have been destroyed, and that Arafat is still besieged at his office as a hostage.
It is also true that thousands of Palestinians and their leaders are held hostage, and that the entire Palestinian people are now experiencing the utmost suffering as part of their daily lives.
It is an illusion for these criminal administrations to imagine that they have triumphed and that they are now in a position to dictate their own conditions on this great people.

The real victor in this battle is the Palestinian people and not the Zionists.
The occupation of Palestinian towns cannot last, so the Zionist forces will have to withdraw from these towns sooner or later.

As for the towns and refugee camps that have been destroyed, they will soon be reconstructed by the Palestinian people who have skillfully adapted themselves to the most difficult circumstances.
The reconstruction will take place more quickly than what the criminals in Tel Aviv and Washington think.
As has been acknowledged by Uri Avneri, a veteran Zionist writer, the intifadah's structure "exists within millions of Palestinians and also within tens of millions of Arabs in whose chests the fire of anger is blazing."
