"We should conduct proper research work to protect the environment, such as the air and water, in order to maintain people's health and provide them with more hygienic and civilized living conditions."
In discussing the draft regulations to put the "Kyoto Protocol" into force, Japan openly took issue with the draft regulations only because the contents of the regulations were not in its favor.

This is the reason why many people of the world today are demanding that the world take concrete measures for protecting the environment, as they have come to realize its importance.
It is a well-known fact that the "Kyoto Protocol" was adopted at the Fifth Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Japan in 1997.
According the "Kyoto Protocol," developed countries are supposed to set goals to reduce greenhouse gases emission and officially put the "Kyoto Protocol" into force by the year 2002.

At the 1997 conference, representatives of many countries of the world supported and welcomed the adoption of the "Kyoto Protocol" as an epoch-making measure to curb the warming of the earth's surface and atmosphere.
It was expected that the protocol would be ratified by the countries that signed it and would have a legal binding force.

Japan even called for working out practical measures to have it enter into force.
In the midst of this situation, a Japanese official visited the United States and received the instruction that Japan should avoid inordinate behavior with respect to the issue of implementing the "Kyoto Protocol."
What Japan is doing with respect to the issue of putting the "Kyoto Protocol" into force is tantamount to an act of betrayal against mankind in the effort to protect human lives, health, and the earth's atmosphere.
