Great Western says Ahmanson consents short .

Great Western has agreed to be acquired by Seattle-based Washington Mutual Inc and has rejected Ahmanson's initial offer and a subsequent revision that increased the amount of stock that would be offered to Great Western shareholders .
The Ahmanson proposals are designed to pressure the Great Western board to run an open auction process .
One proposal is for adoption of a non-binding resolution urging the Great Western board to provide non-public information to Ahmanson and to enter into negotiations .

In a press release , Great Western said "_ it is an indisputable fact that an overwhelming majority of Great Western stockholders have not consented to Ahmanson's proposed resolutions and amendments to Great Western's By-laws .
The release continued , "_ what Ahmanson has carefully avoided acknowledging is that it has fallen far short_of obtaining the necessary consents from a majority of Great Western shares by its artificial March 27 deadline .

Peter Gleason , an analyst with Institutional Shareholder Services ( ISS ) said that , under Delaware law , Ahmanson can continue soliciting consents until approximately May 12 .
The spokesman said Ahmanson stands behind its numbers that more than 80 percent of voted shares back its solicitation and that 19 of Great Western's 20 largest shareholders have voted for or indicated a vote for Ahmanson's proposals .
The spokesman declined to specify how many consents Ahmanson has actually received .
