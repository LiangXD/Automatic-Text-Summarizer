Bulgaria starts stabilisation plan for Biohim Bank .
Bulgaria's cabinet on Monday approved a $50 million stabilisation plan for state Biochim bank in line with pledges made to international lenders to stabilise ailing banks , the government's press centre said .

Under the stabilisation plan the Finance Ministry would issue $50 million of 18-month T-notes , which will be bought out by Bulbank , Bulgaria's biggest and most stable state-owned bank .
Biochim Bank would then buy bad debt bonds from the central bank's portfolio well below their minimum acceptable price with part of the money and possibly resell them later at a higher price to boost its capital , a finance ministry official said .
The minimum acceptable price of domestic dollar-denominated bad debt bonds is now set at 45 percent of par .

Biochim Bank is the only operating local state bank with a negative capital net worth and suffers a serious liquidity shortage that needs to be compensated from the budget and the central bank , bankers said .
Biochim Bank had a capital-to-risk assets ratio of five percent at the end of last year after it managed to collect some risk loans and received long-term government securities worth $81 million to boost its capital .

Biochim Bank was set up through a merger of three smaller institutions in 1995 .
The Bank Consolidation Company , which manages state equity in local commercial banks , holds over 98 percent of Biochim Bank's share capital .
Stabilising state banks by boosting their capital prior_to introduction of a restrictive monetary mechanism is seen as an alternative to new bank closures by the caretaker cabinet .
