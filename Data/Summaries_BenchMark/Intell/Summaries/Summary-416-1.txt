uh how do you feel about gun control
yeah there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun because they don't really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores

i'm from California  my mom the last time i was like purchased a gun my  my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one  and
it really is uh the only problem i have with gun control is that they the radicals wanna ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gonna be be the people who are gonna kill you anyway
yeah exactly right it really is because they're gonna get them one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so

people that are uh criminals are the ones that are gonna get them and then you have no defense against these people when they do  come into your house or something
God gun control  it's it's such a heated topic in the the and people get so emotional about it

yeah Marge i don't know what happened to your husband he just never came back
uh i think we just hang up yeah okay  thanks bye
yeah yeah we just say good-bye and hang up okay okay okay thanks bye-bye
