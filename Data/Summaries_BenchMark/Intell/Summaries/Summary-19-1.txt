     Christian Vieri had the honour of celebrating his international debut on Saturday by scoring Italy's 1,000th goal but another against Poland in Chorzow on Wednesday could have the greater long-term significance .
	

     Having already beaten England at Wembley , a win for Cesare Maldini's men would effectively secure their place at next year's World Cup finals in France .

     It would put them six points clear at the top of European group two with home games against their main challengers still to come .
	

     And Saturday's 3-0 win over Moldova in Trieste was the perfect preparation .
	

     Three well-taken goals and three valuable points but still room for improvement against a Polish team which also came close to upsetting England at Wembley and who give nothing away on their home turf .

     Maldini is likely to stick as closely as possible to Saturday's side although Lazio defender Alessandro Nesta and Parma striker Enrico Chiesa are out .
	
     The game in Chorzow is one of 12 on Wednesday which should shake up the European qualifiers .
