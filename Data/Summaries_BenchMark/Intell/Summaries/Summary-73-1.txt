About 3,000 people attended a rally denouncing Italy for Friday's sinking $-- in which Tirana says 83 people died $-- and blaming Albanian President Sali Berisha for the Balkan state's slide towards chaos .
Albania's flag , red with a two-headed black eagle , flew at half-mast around the nation on a day of mourning for the victims of the collision between the crammed Russian-built harbour patrol vessel and an Italian navy ship .

At midday , drivers blared their horns across the capital , sirens wailed and church bells rang as people paused for a minute to grieve for the victims of Albania's worst maritime disaster of modern times .
Grief and anger cast a long shadow over Italy's plans to lead a force of about 2,500 troops or police , with another 2,500 in reserve , to protect deliveries of food and medicines in the former communist state racked by armed unrest .
Many of the 34 survivors of the sinking accused the Italian navy of ramming their vessel to stem a flood of refugees after about 13,000 fled across the Adriatic this month .

Rome pushed ahead undaunted with preparations for the multilateral force as Italy's navy , which denies it was to blame , searched for more victims .
Demonstrators in Vlore chanted anti-Berisha slogans in the square by a monument marking where Albania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912 .

The ATA news agency said that two children were killed by a bomb in the central village of Romanice and said that a man was found murdered in nearby Berat .
In the northern town of Kukes , gunmen looted private homes and public offices and a 22-year-old man was killed by gunfire in a new outbreak of violence after an apparent lull .
Rome sent 500 unarmed troops for two years from 1991 to guard aid deliveries and seek to discourage a flood of refugees .
