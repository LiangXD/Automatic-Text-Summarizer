There were casualties in Saturday night's NCAA semifinal battles but the victors said Sunday that everybody would be ready for Monday's national championship game .
Kentucky's NBA-bound shooting star Ron Mercer had cramps in both calves and a tightening hamstring that cut into both his playing time and jumping ability .
Mercer needed several leg massages on the sidelines and still played 34 of the 40 minutes Saturday , so his coach was letting him rest up Sunday .

"_ Because of all those cramps he got the option to rest , and he should come out really fired up tomorrow , because he rested yesterday , _" Pitino said with a smile .
Arizona's useful backup guard Jason Terry played only 20 minutes , his lowest total of the season , and was taken to a hospital for tests and intravenous treatment after he fell during the Wildcats' upset of North Carolina .

"_ After the game , he was checked .
He was dehydrated .

 He was put on IVs to take care of the dehydration .
"_ He_ 's back , he had breakfast with the guys this morning , I understand $....
Our trainer said he looked good .
    Kentucky's quiet young point guard Wayne Turner said : "_ Physically there was a_lot_of bumping and banging .
  Pitino predicted that Monday's championship game would be more of the same , in view of Kentucky's all-out pressure defence and Arizona's blazing speed : "_ I think the team standing at the end is going to win this .
