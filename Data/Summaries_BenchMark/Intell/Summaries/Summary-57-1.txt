JAPAN : Japan land scheme called good first step .
Japan announced a range of measures on Monday to try to jump start its long-stalled real estate market , a move analysts called a good first step but hardly the final answer to the problem .

Forming the backbone of the package was the easing of rules that would allow real estate held as collateral to be turned into securities to be sold to investors .
Huge , unrealised losses in real estate are seen by many analysts as being at the core of Japan's financial traumas .
Other measures include the use of public money to buy up land for public development projects , such as old-age homes , day-care centres and parks , as_well_as the easing of zoning and other regulations to promote such projects .

The measures are seen as vital if Japan's banks are to one day rid themselves of their mountain of bad loans .
Analysts also said the amount of public money to be set aside to buy land was not enough to make a huge impact on either land prices or to help bodies which administer bad loans .

Others also said while securitisation would provide a framework for channelling funds into the land market , not much was going to happen until investors believed prices had bottomed out .
A string of successful sales of blue-chip properties over the past two months have given a psychological boost to the market , leading many analysts to declare the worst over for prime property .
But even Richard Li , whose Hong Kong's Pacific Century Group bought a tract of prime Tokyo land for double its forecast price , says while generally bullish on Japan's land market , he does not think prices have hit bottom .
