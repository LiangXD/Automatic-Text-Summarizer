We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent, able to manipulate the universe on its own behalf  the egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady, powerful flight.
As I have emphasized before, a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents, ways of making a living, and the search procedures, mutation, recombination, as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents.

The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents.
Chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations.
I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories, for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and cannot deduce that which will unfold.

Among other things, we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds.
The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent  say, an early bacterium  is somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world.

And the stunning fact directly before us, every day, is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf.
Once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere.
But the series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space.
