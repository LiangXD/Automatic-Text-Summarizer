Although the company has already announced major contracts such as a recent deal signed with Xerox Corp , the licensing revenues may take longer to come in , Spyglass said .

Spyglass has three main business categories $-- connectivity products , infrastructure and professional services $-- and various new products were recently launched .
Spyglass said its professional services division , which makes the software work on a customer's particular device , is expected to account for 30 percent of its business .
