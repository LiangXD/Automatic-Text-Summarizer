COTABATO CITY - An alleged member of Nur Misuari's elite force said Saturday there is a plan to rescue their jailed leader.
Rasul told Radio Mindanao Network that some 1,000 members of the Misuari force have been on standby and are prepared to spring their leader from detention in Sta.

Rasul admitted that even if there was a strong desire among Misuari's followers to free him, the plan would fail if the jailed rebel leader went against it.
"We should remain calm and let the law take its course," Iribani, designated government spokesperson for Misuari's case, said he told a group of Muslim leaders and MNLF commanders in a dialogue in Zamboanga City.
The local government official held a dialogue with the Muslim leaders to officially report to them Misuari's status and answer their questions about his arrest and detention.

As this developed, the number of lawyers who will defend Misuari grew to 28, after former Davao City Mayor Benjamin de Guzman and two others agreed to serve as his counsel.
De Guzman said it was lawyer Macapanton Abbas Jr. who asked him, former vice mayor Dominador Zuno Jr. and city councilor Victorio Advincula to join the team of lawyers that would defend Misuari in court.

The deportation of Misuari by Malaysia also drew flak from opposition legislators who warned that it could trigger a reaction in the government's peace efforts.
Maguindanao Rep. Didagen Dilangalen said the prosecution of Misuari for rebellion could force the government to revive the cases against other rebel leaders, particularly of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the National Democratic Front.
Aside from the sensitive legal questions, Pimentel said there is a growing impression that Misuari could pose a security threat to the country.
