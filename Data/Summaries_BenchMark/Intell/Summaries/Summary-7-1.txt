 Australia's new conservative government on Wednesday began selling its tough deficit-slashing budget , which sparked violent protests by Aborigines , unions , students and welfare groups even before it was announced . 
Two days of anti-budget street protests preceded spending cuts officially unveiled by Treasurer Peter Costello .
	

 As the protesters had feared , Costello revealed a cut to the government's Aboriginal welfare commission among the hundreds of measures implemented to claw back the deficit . 
Programmes for the unemployed were heavily cut , and Costello fended off criticism that the government , driven by conservative ideology , had targetted the poor .

 The cuts , many of which had been disclosed ahead_of the budget , have sparked protests around the country and triggered rioting during a protest by unionists , students , Aborigines and welfare groups at Parliament House on Monday .
 Violence flared again on Tuesday as Aboriginals gathered in Canberra to protest against funding cuts .
But financial markets , which had been expecting a lower deficit were lukewarm .
