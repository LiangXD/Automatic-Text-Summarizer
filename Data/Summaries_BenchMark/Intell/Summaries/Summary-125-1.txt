The Nippon Foundation revealed that the number of pirates in Southeast Asia attacking ships for ransom is on rise.
During the past several years, pirate attacks have shifted from a "syndicated" crime of attacking large cargo ships to a minor crime of theft or robbery.

The foundation warned that the number of pirate attacks, in the new form of sea jacking ships for ransom, has been increasing.
Ninety of the attacks, approximately half of attacks that took place in the world, were reported in Southeast Asian waters.
The most prominent form of such attacks is sea jack for ransom.

In April, in waters off Sumatra Island, an armed group ambushed a cruise ship.
In June, six cases of pirate attacks took place in one day in waters near northern island of Borneo, in which trawl-boats and lumber carriers were ambushed.

Among the eight attacks noted above, it was confirmed that a ransom payment was made in five of the cases.
Yoshihiko Yamada, domestic division chief of Nippon Foundation's Department of Marine Affairs said, "There were very few piracy attacks for ransom on commercial vessels.
A prevailing view is that these piracy attacks are actually committed by anti-government guerrillas amidst mounting political unrest."
