SubHead:   President predicts victory as opposition alleges vote rigging
Zimbabwe's President, predicted he would once again storm to

The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said 40 of its polling agents were abducted by government supporters in what it called the latest intimidation intended to steal the election.

campaign of intimidation to win the poll.
He said 80 MDC rallies had been stopped by ZANU-PF militias or 
the police since the presidential campaign began two months ago, 
leaving him to address 10 major meetings compared with the 50 by 
Mr. Mugabe, who has barnstormed around the country.

Jonathan Moyo, the Information Minister, told reporters in 
Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo the army had been put on high 
alert for the poll.
The government has denied reports of a 
possible army coup to support Mr. Mugabe if he loses.

Mr. Moyo also said the many foreign journalists who have entered

and dirty tricks to fix the two-day election, in which the 
President faces his toughest challenge since independence in 
1980.
"The government of Zimbabwe continues its blatant campaign of 
violence, intimidation and manipulation of the electoral process 
in an effort to win the poll. ...
