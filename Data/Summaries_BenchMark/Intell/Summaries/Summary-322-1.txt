Politics, not the environment, drives Kyoto
The only winners in the increasingly heated debate over global 
warming are the boffins in Ottawa.

Ten days ago, when asked about Kyoto at the now famous Team 
Canada press conference in Moscow, Premier Ralph Klein produced 
a letter indicating that all the premiers, except the 
ever-distinct Quebec, opposed Kyoto.
A few days later in Munich, 
provincial opposition was hedged with qualifications: The NDP 
premiers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba apparently thought the 
"principles" of Kyoto were fine.
Another sign the debate is intensifying emerged last week at a 
global warming conference in Ottawa.

Vincent Gray observed, "all measurements of global temperature 
that are made far from human habitation show no sign of any 
warming."
Vast uncertainty is built into computer models of climate change.

Because 
of the three-dimensional nature of the problem, doubling the 
resolution requires 16 times the computer power.
To get the 
cubes down to a useful size -- around 20 miles a side -- would 
take computers about 1,000 times as powerful as are currently 
available.
Because the estimates of the scale and timing of atmospheric warming are so uncertain, it is just not possible to assess the costs and benefits.
