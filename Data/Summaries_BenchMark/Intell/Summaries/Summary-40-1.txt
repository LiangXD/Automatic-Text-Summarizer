South Korea's ailing won shot up 2.25 percent against the dollar on Monday after the government announced steps to open stock and bond markets wider to foreigners .
	

    Stocks rallied in anticipation of the announcement and the key three-year bond yield edged lower .
	

    After the stock market closed , the government announced it would raise the foreign stock holding ceiling to 23 percent of a listed firm from the current 20 percent , effective from May 1 .
	

    The finance ministry earlier said foreign investors would have access to non-guaranteed bonds issued by large companies for the first time .
	

    The government would also allow domestic financial institutions to raise funds in Asia and Europe for investment in the local bond market this year .
	

    In a further move to bring in more overseas capital and shore up the won , the ministry said it would expand overseas borrowings by state banks .
	
The won has fallen about 13 percent against the dollar since the beginning of last year , pushed lower by a ballooning current account deficit .
	
    The government estimated the measures would attract an additional $8 billion this year , bringing foreign capital infow to $28 billion , instead_of an earlier estimated $20 billion .
    Analysts welcomed the measures , but said immediate beneficiaries would be only a handful of blue chips as many foreigners were still concerned about the poor economic fundamentals .
