SHUTTLEWORTH-MBEKI by Mariette le Roux BLOEMFONTEIN April 27 Sapa MBEKI SPEAKS TO `AFRONAUT' IN OUTER SPACE
Contact was made on Saturday between outer space and the Free State city of Bloemfontein when President Thabo Mbeki spoke to Africa's first astronaut Mark Shuttleworth, aboard the International Space Station.

Mbeki started the 10-minute conversation, broadcast live at the Free State rugby stadium.
Shuttleworth described his journey so far as very exciting, saying the flight had been smooth and everything was going according to plan.
The 28-year-old Internet millionaire said he was sleeping comfortably, and the food was not too bad either.

Mbeki expressed South Africa's pride at Shuttleworth's efforts, saying they would go a long way towards inspiring young people to take up subjects like engineering, mathematics and science.
South Africans should be looking up smiling when he returns, Shuttleworth replied.

Shuttleworth also expressed his condolences to the family and friends of Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete, who died on Friday night, a message Mbeki undertook to convey.
Shuttleworth, accompanied by Russian flight commander Yury Gidzenko and Italian cosmonaut Roberto Vittori, reached the ISS at 0755 GMT, two days after blasting off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
The world's second space tourist, Shuttleworth was paying 20 million dollars for his 10-day journey into space, where he would carry out experiments into the HI virus which causes AIDS.
