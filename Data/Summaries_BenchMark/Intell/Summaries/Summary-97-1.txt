Continuing at a steady but unspectacular pace , U.S. car and truck sales for March are expected to show gains for Japanese and German automakers at the expense of Detroit's Big Three , analysts said Monday .
Both Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are expected to report March sales declines of about 3 percent , compared with a year ago , while General Motors Corp. may post gains of 3 percent to 6 percent over last year's strike-affected results .

Chrysler plans to report sales on Tuesday , with GM following Wednesday and Ford on Thursday .
Analysts said Japanese automakers are expected to continue increasing sales and market share , based on a hot portfolio of new products coupled with a weak Japanese yen that allows them to price more aggressively .
Analysts estimate that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for March light vehicle sales will be about 15 million to 15.4 million units , compared with 15.5 million a year ago .

The Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase in interest rates last week is not expected to have an immediate effect on vehicle sales , analysts said .
Ford's truck sales are expected to be up 2 percent to 3 percent , while Chrysler's truck sales are expected to be flat to down 1 percent .

GM's sales in March 1996 suffered from a 17-day brake plant strike that shut down production of nearly all of its North American assembly plants , particularly affecting the availability of light trucks .
But GM's improved sales are not expected to be enough to offset the market share gains by Toyota Motor Corp. , Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and other Japanese automakers , particular in the intermediate passenger car market .
German automakers , including Audi AG and Mercedes-Benz AG , are also expected to show improvements , adding to impressive market share gains of a full percentage point through the first two months of the year .
