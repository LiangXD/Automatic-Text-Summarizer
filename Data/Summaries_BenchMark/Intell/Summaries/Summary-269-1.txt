The Nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in Franklin Park, Ill., which employs about 800 workers.
Roughly $2 billion of the debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales, and RJR expects to use another $2 billion from the pending, two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit.

The sale could still fall through if financing problems develop.
It remains crucial for RJR to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands.
RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses," Mr. Gerstner said Friday.

The candy businesses had sales of about $154 million last year, which was roughly 12% of total revenue for RJR's Planters LifeSavers unit, according to a memorandum distributed by RJR's owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., to bankers last December.
The sale, which had been expected, is part of KKR's program to pay down $5 billion of a $6 billion bridge loan by February.

Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a "significant step" in the company's divestiture program, as well as a "a strategic divestiture."
Since KKR bought RJR in February for $25 billion of debt, it has agreed to sell nearly $5 billion of RJR assets.
Nestle's share of 7% before Friday's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc., which have about 40% and 36% of the market, respectively.
