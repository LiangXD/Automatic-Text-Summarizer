Year bill rates fell two basis points to 5.67 pct .

The market got two economic reports on Monday .
Patrick Dimick , trader and Treasury strategist at UBS Securities Inc. , said the front end of the Treasury curve "_ is going to continue to draw some support from flight to quality buying if this stock market carnage continues to grow .

Dimick said that since the Fed raised rates on March 25 , Treasury bills and short coupons "_ have dramatically outperformed intermediate and longer-dated paper , in large part because_of the equity market dynamics .
But the curve flattening trade could get undermined by the flight-to-quality dynamic created by the equity market , Dimick said .
Year bill rates slipped two basis points to 5.67 percent on Monday .
