 Tehran is banking on Malaysia's Petronas acquisition of a 30 percent stake in a project to develop two oil and gas fields in Iran to deflect intense U.S. efforts to isolate the Islamic republic .
	
But the key question now is whether other companies will follow suit in the face of tough new U.S. moves to penalise non-American firms that invest in energy projects in Iran and Libya , analysts and diplomats said . 

 French oil group Total SA on Monday said Malaysia's state-owned energy company Petronas had taken a 30 percent stake in the Sirri A and E fields through its Carigali subsidiary in a deal approved by the Iranian authorities .

 The announcement , ending a search of more than a year for partners in the $600 million project , came two weeks after U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill which would penalise foreign firms which invest $40 million or more annually in Iran's or Libya's energy sectors .
	
 Total , which has always said its dealings with both Iran and Libya were within French and international law , said earlier this month that the U.S. sanctions would not apply to Sirri .
   
 Total signed a contract on July 13 , 1995 with the National Iranian Oil Company covering all phases of the development of the two fields , including studies , delineation , development and production start-up .
