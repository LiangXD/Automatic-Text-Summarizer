Chinese President Jiang Zemin said he would probe with President
Wednesday, strategic cooperation between the two countries, hot 
international issues such as combating terrorism, the situation 
in the Middle East and in Afghanistan.

The Chinese President said the key to solve the issue of the
Middle East lies in reaching a just settlement for the
Palestinian cause and return of the land occupied by Israel.

The Chinese President said his country objects to the Israeli 
policies represented in military attacks, economic siege on 
Palestinians and expansion of the Jewish settlements as well as 
to the acts of violence against innocent civilians.
The Chinese leader said President Mubarak telephoned him after 
last September 11th incidents urging him to do his best for 
saving the peace process between Palestinians and Israel.

He said his country has repeatedly, through proper diplomatic 
channels, urged the Israeli side to fulfill its pledges and to 
respond favorably to endeavors aimed at reaching a settlement in 
the Middle East through negotiations.
The Chinese President said China fully supports the restoration 
by the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights including 
the right to establish the Palestinian State, adding that China 
recognized Palestinian State when it was declared in 1988.
The Chinese President said the economic open door policy and 
reform in China has managed to establish a strong economic 
structure and has enhanced Chinese competitiveness.
