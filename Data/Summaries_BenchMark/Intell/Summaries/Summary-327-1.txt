OTTAWA - The Commonwealth suspended Zimbabwe for a year 
yesterday and called for new elections after concluding Robert 
Mugabe had rigged recent presidential elections.
They 
talked about reconciliation and they invited the government to 
take some people in opposition to be part of the government,"

Within the Commonwealth, Australia, New Zealand 
and Britain led a move to suspend the country, but that was 
resisted by African and Caribbean countries, threatening to 
split the group along racial lines.
South African observers declared the election legitimate, 
despite contrary opinions from observers sent by the 
Commonwealth and the European Union.
Thabo Mbeki, the South African President, has been reluctant to 
impose sanctions on Zimbabwe and it is believed Olusegun 
Obasanjo, the Nigerian leader, also had reservations about 
suspension.

Election observers reported thousands of voters were not given 
the chance to cast ballots in the election, while others were 
intimidated into voting for Mr. Mugabe's governing ZANU-PF 
party.
"What is critical at the moment is to see how we can restore 
legitimacy on a government that has stolen an election and that 
government must now deal with national questions of drought and 
food shortages," Mr. Tsvangirai said.

In Canada, the opposition parties were highly critical of the 
Commonwealth, saying it should have suspended Zimbabwe 
indefinitely until Mr. Mugabe holds free and fair elections.
The MDC will never accept coming into a 
government that has no legitimacy," said Keith Martin, the
Canada froze future project funding to Zimbabwe last May, 
suspended export funding and last week banned Zimbabwe officials 
from visiting, but Mr. Martin said more sanctions should be 
imposed. "
