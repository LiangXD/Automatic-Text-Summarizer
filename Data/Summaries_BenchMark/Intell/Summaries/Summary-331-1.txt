HARARE, Zimbabwe - As Robert Mugabe moved to consolidate his 
victory in elections most observers denounced as rigged, an ugly 
split was opening up in the response from black African nations 
and the West.
Mr. Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader for all its 22 years of 
independence, won a fifth term in office yesterday, defeating 
his opponent Morgan Tsvangirai in an election marred by 
violence, intimidation and the manipulation of electoral laws.

"We foresaw electoral fraud but not daylight robbery," he said 
during a brief news conference yesterday.
Opposition critics attacked the Prime Minister for not 
immediately denouncing the election.
Sam Motsuenyane, head of a 50-member observer mission from South 
Africa, said the result "should be considered legitimate" and 
blamed the difficulties faced by some voters on "administrative 
oversight.

team wishes to commend the electoral and polling 
officers for the able manner in which they conducted the 
elections," said Gertrude Mongella, leader of the OAU observers.
Domestic observers tended to side with the MDC, denouncing the 
election as fraud-tainted and unfair.

The Crisis in Zimbabwe Committee, a coalition of church and 
civic groups, called for Zimbabweans to protest the elections 
tomorrow in a "constitutionally acceptable" manner.
The government was taking no chances of a popular uprising, 
putting the military on alert and setting up police roadblocks 
around Harare and other large cities.
Thousands of voters in Harare were chased away from polling 
stations on Monday night by police, despite waiting for three 
chaotic days to cast their ballots.
