 Ronald Sandler , chief executive of Lloyd's of London , on Tuesday underwent a second day of court interrogation about the 300-year-old insurance market's multibillion-dollar recovery plan , which he defended as critical to Lloyd's solvency .
	
Sandler was questioned for four hours in a federal courtroom by lawyers for American investors in Lloyd's and by U.S. District Judge Robert Payne about Lloyd's complex restructuring plan to settle large losses .

Under the rescue proposal , Lloyd's was to reinsure billions of dollars in liabilities , including pollution and asbestosis-related claims in the United States , in a new company called Equitas .
	
The suit , which names 93 plaintiffs , seeks to block the plan until more detailed financial information is released . 

 When asked by the judge who the benefactors would be , Sandler said he was not able to answer .

 Payne earlier criticised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to U.S. securities laws .
