It is learned that the manned spaceship will have a liftoff weight of about eight tonnes, and is less than 10 meters long and 3.5 meters in diameter.
The spaceship has been designed with comprehensive reference to the Russian spaceship Soyuz.

At the rear of the spaceship is the propulsion capsule to provide thrust to the spaceship in orbital control and return to earth.
In accordance with the plan, China's manned spaceship will conduct a series of scientific tests and earth observation after it is launched into space.
The manned spaceflight will enable China to have preliminary space combat capability.

The solar energy batteries usually cannot meet the needs of numerous equipment on a spaceship.
It is understood that China has successfully resolved this problem to provide sufficient power supply for its spaceship.

By referring to the designs of the Russia spaceship Soyuz, it is very possible that China will apply the lift control technology in its manned spaceship.
The technology will enable the spaceship to limit its mobility in the atmosphere.
Judging from the selection of recovery sites for the two previous flights, the site for recovering the manned spaceship may be situated in the grassland of Inner Mongolia.
