uh-huh uh-huh yeah sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them aren't from anybody at all
we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted

i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their salesman salesman to come out
yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations

and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago
and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me

now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in
but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like they they see that word and it says uh go
and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door
