Albanian rebels add Italy to enemies' list .
Albanian rebels holding the Adriatic port added Rome to their list of enemies on Monday after a crowded refugee boat intercepted by the Italian navy sank last week .

The sudden rush of hatred toward Rome comes just ahead_of the planned deployment of an Italian-led multinational security force in Albania to protect humanitarian relief supplies .
The Italian navy was enforcing its orders to turn back refugees fleeing from Albania .
The dead included many women and children from Vlore .

Residents and the rebel council , which has defied President Sali Berisha for almost two months , hold Rome responsible for the deaths because_of its policy of forcing back refugees .
Council leader Albert Shyti told the rally Italy must admit responsibility , punish the guilty and compensate families of victims and "_ only then will Italians be accepted in our town _" .

Italy has blamed the accident on erratic manoeuvres by the Albanian captain but no one in Vlore seems to question who was responsible .
Since the start of the rebellion in February , Berisha has been public enemy number one in Vlore , where Albania declared independence from Turkish Ottoman rule in 1912 .
More than 13,000 Albanians have fled to Italy this month and men at Monday's rally said despite the boat sinking they had no choice but to pay $500 to travel illegally to Italy .
