Finance Minister Pedro Malan insisted yesterday on the need for a "more profound constructive engagement" on the part of multilateral institutions and governments in helping Argentina.
Credit needs banks, a functioning payment system.

Malan criticizes the stance taken by multilateral institutions like the IMF, who are asking for reforms in Argentina before the country can receive financial help.
Given the degree of uncertainty that prevails over the inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates and over the economy's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, the approach should not be the traditional one, the Finance Minister says.
Pedro Malan's attitude in relation to Argentina is very different from that of Jaime Caruana, governor of the Bank of Spain, the Spanish central bank.

To Caruana, Argentina has to "create a broad program that generates internal and external stability and discuss it with the IMF."
The Bank of Spain Governor did not want to detail what points Argentina should deal with to expand its program.

Spain is one of the leading investors in Argentina, whose instability had a big impact on the results of Spanish banks in 2001.
"Today we have comparable statistics; there is a macroeconomic monitoring group in the Finance Ministry and experts from the six countries' central banks who meet regularly.
The Minister says that after the October elections in Brazil, it will be necessary to make more progress in the process of making changes to which the country has been committed over the past years.
