The Bible describes how David' s soldiers conquered Jerusalem
        by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the
        city by surprise.
The courtyard
        around the Temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of
        pilgrims, and the Temple Mount was shored up by retaining walls made
        with great stone blocks.

For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins, until the Roman
        Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to
        Jupiter.
The ruins of Jerusalem were liberated, but, in the end, Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss of life.
But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth
        century, and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again.

Still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation,
        Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam.
The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th
        century, when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the
        destination of thousands of travelers each year.

Jerusalem flourished during the early years of
        the Mandate.
West Jerusalem, separated from the rest of the
        new Jewish nation, held out under siege for several months until
        Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the
        coastal areas.
Jews were evacuated from the Old City' s Jewish Quarter,
        and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem.
