He points out that the United States has allowed the Red Cross to inspect conditions at the Guantanamo base.
EU foreign affairs spokesman Javier Solana, among others, has also criticized the United States for not recognizing the al-Qaida prisoners as prisoners of war as understood in the Geneva Convention.

The Swedish Government has also expressed concern about the prisoners' rights.
Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller (Conservative People's Party) is urging the United States to guarantee the prisoners the status of prisoners of war and in consequence protection under the terms of the Geneva Convention.
"I expect the United States to satisfy the requirements of the international conventions," Per Stig Moller said at a press conference in Berlin on Monday.

The Social Democratic Party takes the view that the Danish Government should raise its voice against the United States.
" the United States has a point when it says that it can be difficult to decide who are terrorists and who are prisoners of war.

The Danish People's Party sees no reason to criticize the United States.
I can imagine that the United States has had good reasons for transporting them to Cuba," foreign affairs spokesman Peter Skaarup (Danish People's Party) says.
As long as no Danes are involved, the Danish People's Party does not think that Denmark should interfere.
