But he let slip the opportunities to turn back, because the forces that drive him -- his desire to affect change, his sense of duty to his peers and his ambition -- would not permit him to pass up the biggest chance of his political life.
Mr. Stoiber seized it once the CDU made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman.

That has always been the basic premise for a CSU chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party.
It does not guarantee success at the polls -- or even solidarity in the campaign.
Mr. Stoiber has done everything in his power to spare himself the fate of his mentor, Franz Josef Strauss.

The CDU chose him because it believes in victory.
The government is floundering, more seriously than anyone would have thought six months ago.

The Union parties could not have wished for a better situation from which to launch their campaign.
He will be made to realize that he cannot command the CDU, that his power base lies in Munich and not in Berlin, and that the invitation of kingmakers to accept the crown comes at a cost.
Nor will Mr. Stoiber have any illusions of what it means to lead an election campaign, although he can be confident in the knowledge that what is at stake is not Edmund Stoiber, nor the Union, but Germany as a whole.
