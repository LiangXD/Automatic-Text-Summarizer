MUNICH, Germany -- Russia's defense minister said Sunday that 
his country disagrees with the U.S. view of Iraq, Iran and North
It is a stark reminder that 
differences remain between two former enemies who have moved 
closer together since Sept. 11.

Foreign Minister Sergei Ivanov told a global conference of 
government and military leaders that he sees no evidence that 
any of the three nations supports terrorism and insisted that 
any move against them must follow international law.
Sunday, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accused Iran of giving 
refuge to al Qaeda or Taliban members escaping from Afghanistan.
China's official Xinhua news agency also weighed in Sunday on 
Bush's choice of words, accusing the president of orchestrating 
public opinion in advance of possible strikes against the three 
countries in an expansion of the war against terrorism.

What the three states do share, it went on, 
is chilly relations with the United States.
Ivanov said the West uses a double standard in its definition of 
terrorism, asking why members of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda 
network are terrorists, but not Chechen separatists fighting 
Russia.

His remarks came on the last day of the Munich Conference on 
Security, an invitation-only gathering of 400 international 
leaders who this year debated the war on terrorism.
A diverse U.S delegation delivered a singular message to 
conference participants: NATO remains vital and the United 
States needs a range of allies in the fight against terrorism 
and intends to consult its friends.
Ivanov said there was no evidence Belarus has sold arms to 
nations under sanction such as Iraq, though it did do business 
with nations not under sanctions such as Tajikistan, Angola and 
``even Gulf states.''
