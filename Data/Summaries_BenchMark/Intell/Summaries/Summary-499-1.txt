The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before Zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote.
The British leader fudged his reply and the Commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the "Blair report" had already been written in London before the Commonwealth mission even left for Zimbabwe.

Back in Harare, some strange things were happening with the Commonwealth mission.
On the spurious grounds that the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building, the Commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned Meikles Hotel.
But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government, the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election.

It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel.
There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission.

The Australians, in common with other white members of the Commonwealth, the European Union (EU), the Americans, Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and Mugabe as the head of State.
Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth.
In line with Commonwealth consensus, the views of the majority are taken to be the views of the Commonwealth as a whole.
