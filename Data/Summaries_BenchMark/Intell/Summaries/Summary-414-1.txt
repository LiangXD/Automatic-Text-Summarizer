okay Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy
i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type

things are you going to consider you know what uh you said something about the about the
Um well i guess uh price is always the big consideration
i have preferences for uh for some um makers over others

um and i would sort of like to buy American
several things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be

you know we bought the car new and after  um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch
yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like uh
no but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune
