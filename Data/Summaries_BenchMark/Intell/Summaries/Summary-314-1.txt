Venezuelans awoke on Friday to a country transformed by the 
dramatic and violent events of the last 24 hours, which left at 
least 11 people dead and more than 80 injured.
His second was to announce the end of the three-day general 
strike he had called with the head of the Confederation of 
Venezuelan Workers (CTV) leader Carlos Ortega in support of 
protesting managers from state oil company PDVSA.

Managers were striking because Mr Chavez had filled the 
company's board of directors with his supporters.
As marchers called for Mr Chavez's resignation outside 
Miraflores, the presidential palace, shots were fired into the 
crowd.
Mr Chavez was addressing the nation to assure them his government respected people's right to demonstrate and freedom of the press.

Moments later he announced that he had taken five national 
television channels off the air for "telling lies about the 
government".
As tanks surrounded Miraflores, Mr Chavez was holed up with 
senior military officers in a bid to save his presidency.

General Lucas Rincon held a brief news conference to say Mr
Mr Chavez is currently detained at Fuerte Tiuna army base in 
Caracas and could face possible charges for his role in the 
killings.
The challenge now is to heal the deep 
social divisions that exist within the country.
