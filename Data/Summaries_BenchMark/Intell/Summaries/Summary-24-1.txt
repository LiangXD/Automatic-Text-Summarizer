Major League Baseball , which is dedicating the 1997 campaign to the anniversary of the most profound change in the game , launches a new season Tuesday full of fresh twists and challenges .
The World Series champion New York Yankees will play the New York Mets , and the Chicago Cubs will battle the Chicago White Sox this season in games that count as nearly 100 years of tradition dissolves with the advent of interleague play .
Purists are outraged .
Others are salivating at the propects of stirring up new rivalries and fleshing out what had been only a match-up fantasy of day-dreaming fans .
  It is fitting that this breaking down of barriers comes as baseball celebrates the greatest dream come true for the game $-- the smashing of the colour line 50 years ago by Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers .

  The labour peace that was finally reached after the crippling players' strike of 1994 brought about a salary cap agreement between the owners in addition to interleague play .
	
     In interleague play , the designated hitter will be used in American League parks and not in games played on National League ground .
	

     East Division teams meet their counterparts in the East , Central plays Central and West gets West in games that represent less than one-tenth of the 162-game schedule .
	
The salary cap taxes teams for spending over a limit .
	
This introduces new budget concerns for the big market teams that have the cash to sign premier free agents .
	
There was no let-up , however , in the roster roulette that has characterised the modern game .
	
Some of the most powerful teams made dramatic changes in preparation for the new season , while two hopefuls made sweeping moves to climb the ladder .
