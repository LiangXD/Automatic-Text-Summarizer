With the increasing likelihood the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again by early July , U.S. Treasury market participants said that the bill sector should benefit from rising coupon yields and a big drop in stock prices .
Players said the sector is highly expensive , but between quarter-end pressures and the Fed seemingly embarking on a tightening cycle , it is logical for bills to do well .

"_ This is a preservation-of-capital period , _" said Craig Coats , co-head of taxable fixed income at Prudential Securities Inc , noting players will continue to park money in safe-haven areas such as bills and repos for the time being .
Helping drive rates down , traders said , is the smaller pool of bills offered .
After falling 140 points Thursday , the Dow Jones industrial average was down another 80 points Monday afternoon .

Some of the money in stocks was shifted to bills , traders said , although a major allocation out_of stocks is not expected .
Mahoney said that weaker stock prices aside , there are enough reasons the front end should do well in the near term .

Mahoney forecasts a steepening of the overall yield curve , perhaps as much as 10 basis points .
The two-year to 30-year curve steepened a_bit on Monday , with the spread widening out to 66 basis points from 64 late Thursday .
Traders noted that the near term directon of the curve and whether bills can hold at what is perceived to be 10 basis points too expensive lies with Friday's March employment report .
