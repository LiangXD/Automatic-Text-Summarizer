Argentina's Chaos Raises New Doubts on Monetary Fund
Some say the monetary fund showed callousness by failing to give 
new aid to Argentina early this month, as the country's economic 
program, designed with I.M.F. approval, was forcing painful 
austerity measures on its citizens.

In practice the Bush administration has to take a clear stance on such bailouts and has made international financial policy a low priority.
Peru's finance minister, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, complained today 
that the fund bungled its dealings with Argentina by adopting 
inconsistent policies that were at turns passive and inflexible.
"The fund is partly to blame for this because the fund did not 
sound the alarm in time and then took a very hard line when 
things were incredibly difficult," he told Peruvian radio.

The French, who like the 
United States are significant fund shareholders, have called on 
the lending agency to step up its involvement to help Argentina 
recover.
But many say the monetary fund should have called 
government officials to account sooner.

"If Argentina got its core economic policies right, it would 
have avoided this problem," said Charles Calomiris, a finance 
and economics professor at Columbia University who has been 
sounding the alarm about Argentina for months.
It is difficult to place blame for Argentina's economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy was designed by Argentina itself, sometimes over the objections of the fund's economists.
But by December, as Mr. Cavallo resorted to freezing bank 
accounts and raiding pension funds to find enough hard currency 
to make debt payments, collapse looked imminent.
