Another member of the South African Observer Mission to Zimbabwe says the past weekend's presidential election in the southern African country was not free and fair.
Methodist Bishop Purity Malinga on Tuesday echoed the sentiments of South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairwoman Brigalia Bam that Zimbabwe election did not conform to international standards.

Bam on Sunday said she believed Zimbabwe's election was not free and fair, adding they were not in line with international standards as well as those of her organisation.
Each member was handed a booklet containing guidelines on Zimbabwean election laws. "
The booklet was published by the Electoral Institute of South Africa, in Pretoria.

Malinga said according to the guidelines in the booklet, the election had been legitimate.
The election was run by the police and the army who carried weapons.

SAOM on Monday stopped short of declaring the Zimbabwean presidential election free and fair, but the African National Congress majority on the committee declared the poll "credible".
The majority report, endorsed only by the ANC, said the observer mission had noted that over three million Zimbabweans had cast their votes and this substantially represented the will of the people.
Other delegates in SAOM aligned themselves with the findings of the Southern African Development Community parliamentary forum that said the vote had not met SADC's norms and standards.
