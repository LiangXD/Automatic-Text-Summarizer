The gift that I am asking you to make will be used to
      continue our mission of helping people prepare for, find and keep
      jobs.

Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment
      barrier, the positive effects radiate throughout our community: The
      business community welcomes not only another worker, but a consumer with
      increased purchasing power.

On his
      way home, he shares the story with four people at a street corner.
In order to develop job skills, a man with some serious disabilities
      begins working in Goodwill's industrial division.

      time to waste.
