Mugabe wins poll, amid claims of rigging
Registrar General Tobaiwa Mudede announced on state television 
that Mugabe was re-elected with 1,685,212 votes against 
1,258,758 votes for Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for 
Democratic Change (MDC).

Declare Robert Mugabe the winner for the office of the presidency of Zimbabwe,' Mudede said.
Observers had warned that should the outcome be seen to have 
been rigged, violence could explode across the volatile southern 
African nation.
As the results were being announced, about 100 heavily armed 
soldiers moved into Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayao and 
surrounded the MDC offices, where opposition officials had 
gathered.

Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi has put security forces on 
the highest level of alert, according to state media.
Foreign governments all but dismissed the outcome even before it 
was announced, threatening to leave Mugabe internationally 
isolated despite his victory.

The election is the hardest fought battle for Zimbabwe's top 
post since liberation war hero Mugabe took over after 
independence from Britain in 1980.
The tumultuous campaign grabbed international headlines and 
sparked diplomatic rows that landed Mugabe with sanctions from 
the European Union and the United States.
Violence has claimed 
at least 33 lives, mostly those of opposition supporters, since 
the start of the year.
