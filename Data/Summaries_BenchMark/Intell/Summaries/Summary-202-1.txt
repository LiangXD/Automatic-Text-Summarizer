While the foods are strange to the prisoners, the United States has abided by the dietary rules that Muslims have to follow.
Basing on the media reports, the US Government has many things to consider on this issue.

After the September 11 pains, the US Government is harboring deep hatred for these prisoners.
If it chooses to characterize these detainees as POWs, then it must release some of them sooner or later and it is very likely that these people will again attack the United States with terrorist means.
Before the war, the United States appeared as an upholder of justice; while it still wants to handle problems like an upholder of justice after the war, it must win support.

Mary Robinson, senior UN special commissioner for human rights, said: "We must urge the United States to pay attention to respecting the obligations prescribed in international law."
After winning the war, the US Government has come up with many other excuses to deny the captives' POW status.

Even though Uncle Sam's certain worries are justified, his hegemonic way of setting the rules all by himself is hardly convincing.
The little cell will house two or more prisoners with the arrival of more captives in the future.
Reprisal against the prisoners of war shall be prohibited.
