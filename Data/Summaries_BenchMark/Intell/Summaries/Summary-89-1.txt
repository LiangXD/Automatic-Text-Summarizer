Ashland Inc said Monday that it is still looking for a partner for its refining and marketing business , though the company would neither confirm nor deny a report that it is about to announce a deal with Marathon Oil Co .
Among those previously rumored are Amoco Corp and BP America , both companies which have a major presence in the middle of the U.S. where Ashland is concentrated .

Ashland , under pressure last year from investor Providence Capital to improve its performance , announced a major restructuring in December .
Also in the group are 750 company-owned outlets ( SuperAmerica , Ashland ) plus a 523-store branded jobber network , the Valvoline motor oil business and pipeline and other distribution assets mainly grouped under Scurlock Permian interests .
Ashland , after appointing CS First Boston advisor last December , said earlier this month that it is seeking an initial public offering ( IPO ) of 3.1 million shares in its exploration unit , Blazer Energy Inc .

The company plans to offer 82.3 percent of the company to Ashland Inc shareholders after offering 17.7 percent in the IPO .
Blazer Energy consists of an Appalachian natural gas operation and about 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil production in Nigeria .

As part of the restructuring , Ashland said it will merge the coal businesses in which it holds controlling interests , Ashland Coal and Arch Mineral of St. Louis .
The company also has an ongoing program to buy back up_to a million common shares .
Marathon also declined to comment on whether_or_not the two companies had a deal .
