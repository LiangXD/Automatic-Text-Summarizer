A report about settlement activity in Palestinian territories has confirmed that 36 new settlement sites--settlement enclaves--have been created since Sharon became Prime Minister of Israel less than a year ago.
Also the report, whose findings were announced at a press conference yesterday, noted that three military positions were turned into civilian settlements and work had started on a new settlement called Giv'at Sal'it in the southern valleys region.

Construction activities carried out in settlements during the period totaled 49.
The report also noted that work on bypass roads continued at a rate faster than that of the government of Barak who gave free rein to settlement activities.
Sharon's government has embarked on building 10 bypass roads, some of which were approved by the previous government.

In the Gaza Strip 1,051 donums were annexed to existing settlements, 32 new housing units were built, and work on 190 additional units was started.
Taysir Khalid explained that "the Palestinian intifadah has raised the settlement issue anew--one of the causes of the intifadah--in unprecedented force as a basic element and condition for reaching any solution."

Advocate Faris Abu-Hasan pointed to the violation of international laws represented in settlement activity and settlement building, and to Israel's continuing refusal to respond to international appeals and violation of relevant international laws.
He indicated that settlements have emerged as military bastions and bases for launching attacks against Palestinians during the intifadah.
While a settler who opened fire on a group of Palestinians wounding four of them was sentenced to four years imprisonment by an Israeli court.
