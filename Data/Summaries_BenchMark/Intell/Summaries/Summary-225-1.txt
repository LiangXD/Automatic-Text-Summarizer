Recent weeks have seen important developments on both sides of the Atlantic for the policy pursued in combating climate change.
With the major decision, the European Union is opening the door to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in August 2002 in Johannesburg.

It should be remembered that after Bush described the Kyoto Protocol as "fundamentally flawed" international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed.
We now know that the US withdrawal did not stop the world community from deepening this important multilateral agreement for combating climate change.
Although there is a certain satisfaction at seeing President Bush recognize the need to fight climate change, that must not in any way conceal the extreme weakness of what he announced.

Under the US program, US emissions as a proportion of GDP must fall by 18 percent between 2002 and 2012, or in other words energy efficiency must increase by 18 percent.
In its last report, the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] called for rapid and decisive action to at least avert the most serious consequences of climate change.

Scientists estimate that the industrialized countries must reduce their emissions to around 70 percent by 2020 to maintain climate change at an acceptable level.
Researchers have shown that without a determined policy on climate coordinated at international level the consequences of climate change will be dramatic.
Many studies show that an active policy of climate protection is not in any way contrary to a policy of full employment.
