An understanding that, above anything else, success
      requires genuine effort, a willingness to set challenging goals.
You help
      Jameson campers reach for them.

If the special children are to become the adults we all need them to be, we have to lead them in the right direction right now.
Jameson points the way for children who need that extra hand and I
      hope you'll continue your support this year.
In just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids
      and a few extra activities to a team of almost 60 young adults taking on
      real projects.

A five day camp, J.C. juniors introduces
      at-risk children to Jameson two years earlier than we could previously
      reach them.
The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for
      other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them.

If you can increase your last donation, we
      would appreciate that show of support for the campers and their efforts
      to overcome obstacles and create successful lives.
Thank you again for helping point the way.
Julie Marsh, Executive Director P.S. You make it possible for us to help special kids with learning disabilities, behavior problems and economic disadvantages to gain the confidence required to put genuine effort into achieving real goals.
