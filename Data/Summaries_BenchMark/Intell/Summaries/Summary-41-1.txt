 South Korea on Monday raised the ceiling for foreign share-ownership by three percentage points , but analysts said they saw little short-term impact on the local stock market because_of poor fundamentals . 
Ministry officials said the move , along_with other steps to open wider the local capital market , was aimed at attracting foreign funds to put a brake on the local currency's fall .
	
Analysts welcomed the move , but said immediate beneficiaries would be limited to a handful of blue chips in which foreigners are interested .
	
 The ministry said it expected the increased ceiling to bring a further $3 billion into the market , but securities analysts estimated the fresh inflow of funds at between $500 million and $600 million .
	
Analysts said the country's growing current account deficit and the resulting depreciation of the won are the main factors discouraging foreign investment in local stocks .
 At the end of February , foreigners held 989.12 million shares , or 11.43 percent of total listed local shares , according_to the Securities Supervisory Board .
