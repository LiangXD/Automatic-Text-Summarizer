CAPE CANAVERAL - (AP) -- A South African space tourist received 
a warm welcome aboard the international space station on 
Saturday and settled in for an eight-day, seven-night stay that 
cost him $20 million.
The 28-year-old smiled broadly as he floated into the space 
station and was embraced by its three occupants.

One orbit, or 1 
  hours later, South African President Thabo Mbeki called to 
congratulate the first African citizen in space.
The world's latest space tourist -- dubbed an Afronaut back home 
-- has generated huge excitement in South Africa.
They watched 
from Russian Mission Control outside Moscow as the Soyuz capsule 
smoothly docked with the space station 250 miles up.

When the three leave next Saturday night, they will use the 
Soyuz that has been attached to the station for the past six 
months.
One year ago today, California money manager Dennis Tito became 
the world's first paying space tourist, courtesy of the 
Russians.

NASA opposed Tito's trip, saying he would interfere with space 
station work and possibly even endanger the crew.
Shuttleworth met all the guidelines and 
went through eight months of cosmonaut training in Russia and 
one week of instruction at Johnson Space Center in Houston.
Shuttleworth is flying several science experiments, including 
one for AIDS research.
