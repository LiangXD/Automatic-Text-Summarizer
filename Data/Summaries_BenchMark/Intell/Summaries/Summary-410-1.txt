      Dear Mailhouse donor reminder:
      You and I have done some important work together.
You have helped make
      Goodwill's work possible with your previous support.

Goodwill has devised
      the programs that turned your investment into results.
When you and I
      help somebody find a job, one more person joins the ranks of tax payers,
      fewer tax dollars are spent on public assistance and businesses gain
      another consumer.
There are a lot of barriers that keep people from working: physical
      and mental disabilities, history of welfare dependency and lack of
      education or self-esteem.

And there are a lot of people who face these
      challenges every day of their lives.
Support Goodwill with a
      generous donation today.

We've found ways
      for people with disabilities to enter the workforce.
We've expanded
      Goodwill's proven methods to towns and neighborhoods where they are
      needed most.
We've played different roles.
