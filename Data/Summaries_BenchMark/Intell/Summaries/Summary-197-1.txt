The profound economic crisis in Argentina has coincided with a wave of social tension during recent days.
Public dissatisfaction and an increase in the people's anger in this country have finally resulted in the collapse of Fernando Delaroe's government following several days of protest.

Because of the misguided policies of Argentina's politicians, Argentina is in a state of stagnation for a fourth consecutive years.
Foreign debts are around $132 billion and poverty is dominating the country like a dangerous virus.
The important point is that Argentina has enjoyed the IMF's advice in the execution of these policies.

The main problem that caused the recent shock is also a result of the restrictive economic policies that have been adopted on the advice of IMF experts.
What is clear is that Argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today.

Although IMF officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an IMF executive delegation is actively making changes to Argentina's economy.
The country has attracted a large amount of foreign investment by international companies, from the American continent to Europe.
In the heat of crisis, the interim government has introduced new initiatives.
