Humanitarian law requires that in all circumstances a distinction be made between military targets and those not involved in the armed conflict.
Many countries are parties to them, but the United States has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which US troops are taking part.

Although it is doubtful that all the news reaches us from Afghanistan, a great many press reports suggest that humanitarian law was violated regularly over the past few weeks.
Even if the attacks were directed against a clear military target, the large number of civilian casualties would still never be justifiable, because whoever plans a military attack must take all precautions to prevent such a tragedy.
Humanitarian law leaves no doubt that those who fall captive in their opponent's hands are entitled at all times to decent treatment, even if they do not qualify for prisoner of war status.

Shortly after its decision to take military action, the Bush administration also decided to provide the press with only sparse information about the course of the operation.
A number of other countries have sharpened their laws following 11 September, from increased detention possibilities to stricter legislation on asylum and immigration.

Other states have used the US tragedy to polish their own image.
The fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected.
Observance of the rules will not insure that the fight against terrorism is lost; it will prove respect for human dignity, of which the West is rightly a champion.
