Body of missing ultra marathoner found in New Mexico wilderness
Searchers on Saturday found the body of renowned long-distance runner Micah True, who vanished four days earlier after heading out from a lodge for a morning run in the rugged wilderness near New Mexico's Gila National Forest.

The body was discovered in a remote area of the Gila Wilderness, state police spokesman Lt. Robert McDonald said.
The cause of death was still unknown, but there were no signs of trauma, incident commander Tom Bemis said.
The 58-year-old True, whose extreme-distance running prowess is detailed in the book "Born to Run," set out on what -- for him -- would have been a routine 12-mile run Tuesday from The Wilderness Lodge and Hot Springs, where he was staying.

Lodge co-owner Dean Bruemmer, who helped with the search Saturday, said he last saw his friend at breakfast.
Fourteen search teams that were scouring the area Friday were supplemented with additional volunteer teams from across the state Saturday morning, McDonald said.

Bruemmer said, True knew the trail system well -- which made his disappearance all the more mystifying to everyone.
Michael Sandrock, a columnist who writes about running for The Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, knew True for at least 20 years and had run with him.
True was the race director of The Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon, a 50-plus mile extreme race that took place in Urique, Mexico, on March 4.
