Text of report in English by Italian news agency ANSA web site

I'm ready to go back," Vittori told Italian general Mario Arpino during a telephone call shortly after the Russian Soyuz space capsule made its touch-down in Kazakhstan.
Russian officials said the three men, including the world's second space tourist South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, were in fine condition.
He became the world's second space tourist, after US businessman Denis Tito made a similar voyage a year ago.

His training in Russia combined with his knowledge of American techniques will put him at an advantage if the role of station commander should open up in the future, he said before his training started.
The role is currently reserved for Americans and Russians.

Italy's Umberto Guidoni was the first European to set foot on board the ISS in April 2000, while a third Italian astronaut, Paolo Nespoli, is scheduled to make his trip in 2003-2004.
This covered his training, that of a Belgian substitute and the cost of carrying two scientific experiments on board the Russian Soyuz rocket.
The estimated cost of Vittori's flight with the Russians was around 12.5m dollars.
