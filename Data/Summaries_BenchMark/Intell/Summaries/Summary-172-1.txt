Lawyers for the survivors, who have filed a complaint against Sharon in Belgium, said this.
A few days after filing the complaint, the lawyers received a stack of documents in Hebrew and in English regarding the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the Sabra and Shatila events.

The documents include meeting reports, and intelligence service and interrogation reports.
The lawyers refused to reveal the source of the documents.
Walleyn are Verhaeghe are convinced of the authenticity of the documents.

The lawyers expect that the Public Prosecution Office will request Israel to confirm the documents' authenticity.
In practice, the Phalangist militias operated directly under Israeli command.

Tomorrow, the Chamber for Indictments will begin the debate on Investigating Judge Collignon's questions on the legitimacy of the case against Sharon.
The lawyers have also initiated a civil suit against Elie Hobeika, the militia leader who is regarded as one of the main perpetrators of the massacres.
The lawyers deemed it wise to do this now because one of Collignon's questions is connected with the juridical consequences of a Lebanese amnesty law.
