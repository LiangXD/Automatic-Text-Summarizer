WE ALL like to be taken seriously , especially when we are feeling ill .
But it is not so easy if you have a condition which is not susceptible to diagnosis and has no clear-cut signs or symptoms .
	
According_to one theory , held by some psychiatrists , patients may find doctors increasingly unsympathetic to their plight .
	
But this , it is claimed , may make them more vulnerable than most to negative emotions when they are shown to be powerless .

This may result in swift and brutal treatment of patients with complaints which are difficult to diagnose .
	
Patients claiming to have Myalgic Encephalomyelitis ( ME ) may come into the latter category .
	
Symptoms include fatigue , night sweats , weight loss and exhaustion .

The ME Action Campaign is waging a major campaign to validate ME as a disease .
	
This week the ME Action Campaign released stills from a forthcoming cinema commercial .
	
 The Action Campaign is also seeking support from medical journalists , and I have been asked repeatedly if I was going to add to the & bquo ; adverse & equo ; ME publicity .
