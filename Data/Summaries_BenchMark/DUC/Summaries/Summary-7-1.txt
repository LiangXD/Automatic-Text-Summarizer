Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a strain of "mad cow
disease" affecting their small herd of spiral-horned antelopes (kudu)
can be transmitted much more easily than was thought. Of eight animals
born in the herd since 1987, five have contracted the disease. The
infective agent and its mode of transmission is unknown. Because of
the danger to other animals, the kudu herd has been isolated. Studies
are underway to ascertain if the agent causing the disease in kudu is
the same as that in cows. If so, the kudu must simply be more
susceptible to the disease than cattle.
