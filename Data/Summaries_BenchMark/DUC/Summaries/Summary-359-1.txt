We continue to assess the aftermath of the war.  Saddam consolidates
power by placing family members in key government jobs.
U.N. sanctions take their toll as rationing is in place.  Kuwaiti
society seems directionless and is slow to rebuild.  Former foreign
workers have mostly departed.  Efforts continue to extinguish the
approximately 600 fires in Kuwaiti oil well fields.  The value of
U.S. sophisticated weaponry, Air Force A-10 Thunderbolts and navy
transport ships is underscored.  Patriot missiles, the M-1 tank,
Bradley Fighting Vehicle and Marine Corps amphibious attack vessels
all remain in question.  Displaced Kurds return to home in Northern
Iraq.
