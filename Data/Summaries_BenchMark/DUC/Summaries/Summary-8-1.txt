Bovine Spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), already a multi-million pound
agricultural disaster, now is becoming a major political problem for
European governments. European health ministers will meet next week to
discuss a German proposal to ban British beef imports. A British
scientific journal has called for replacing the entire cattle
population with disease-free herds at an estimated cost of 30 billion
pounds. The infestation, thought to have spread through use of cattle
feed containing remains of infected sheep, has spread despite a ban on
use of such feed in 1988. 8004 cattle born since the ban have died
from the disease.
