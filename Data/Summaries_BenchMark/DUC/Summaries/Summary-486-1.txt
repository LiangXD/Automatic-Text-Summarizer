Biosphere II is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural
proclivity of water.  A stream begins on an 85-foot mountain that
dominates the rainforest.  It then flows through the plains and
grasslands of the savanna, down to the 25-foot deep ocean with its
coral reef, and then to the salt and freshwater marshes, drying up
before it reaches the deserts.  Water-laden air is drawn, climbs the
mountains, and natural cooling and condensing coils bring it down as
rain and dew to feed the stream again.  The project scientists and
engineers were highly innovative in coordinating the environments.
