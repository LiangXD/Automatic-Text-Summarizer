Las Vegas, the paradigm of American excess and decadence, has
discovered Asia.  Oil prices, competition form Atlantic City, NJ and a
failing U.S. economy is forcing Las Vegas to turn its attention toward
Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other booming Asian countries in search
of gamblers.

Some casinos are offering $6 overnight bus tours from Los Angeles's
Chinatown while others are offering all expense paid tours from the
Far East to attract high-rollers.  Other casinos such as Caesars
Palace and the Mirage have opened year-round marketing offices in
Asia.

Desert Inn President Kevin J. Malley estimated 90 percent of that
casino's top 100 gamblers are Asians.
